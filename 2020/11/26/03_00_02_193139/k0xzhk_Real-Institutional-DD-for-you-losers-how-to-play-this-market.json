But I just know there is some bleary eyed idiot from Stocks and Investing here that is like I just CANT bring myself to take these kind of risks, look how expensive the market is!!!\n\nEven though the market is at all time highs, and basically the market has been trading flat other than yesterday, there is crazy volatility underneath the surface. For almost a decade, growth stocks (high top line growth, high multiples, etc) have outperformed value because 1) growth was hard to find as the economy was dog shit 2) interest rates dropped like a stone from 4 down to 1.4% pre-covid which makes cash flows in the out year more valuable today when you discount them back 3) usually high period of disruption due to technology (connectivity, shift to mobile, computing increases, etc). **But basically, when growth is hard to find, you are willing to pay the fuck up for future earnings growth.**\n\nBut boys. Let me tell ya, economic growth is coming the fuck back. One, the Fed goes fucking brrr - and ole Yellen is back in the saddle.1) The Fed is basically a permeant backstop now which basically changes the equation of risk for both investors and companies. 2) The Dems will, and should, print money with reckless abandon. Because the US dollar is the global reserve currency they should print dough until the dollar fucking breaks. And it basically hasn't budged even though the US has spent 7 trilly on Stimulus. 3) Savings rates in both the US and Canada are at all time highs, with interest rates at all time lows. Have you seen the fucking housing market? Not only is there lots of money on the sidelines, **demand is coming online in sync across the globe.** You may never see a demand spike like you are about to see in areas like Leisure / Travel. Hotels in Honolulu aren't going from 150$/night back to $400 next year. Mother fucker they are going to 600. Every live sporting event, concert, festival, restaurant will be fucking PACKED. **4)** The fed changed their inflation policy from 2%, to an average metric - basically meaning they will run the economy hot to bring average inflation up to 2-2.5% over an observed time period. Well inflation has been sub 1.5% for YEARS and they will run this fucker HOT at 5-6% GDP before they touch rates. **Most important thing here is that rates are going up on the ten year, there will be unreal demand for things most affected by the virus, and the relative valuation of low pe stocks is going to start looking reallll good realll fast.**\n\nSo what does this mean? You want to be in early cycle cyclicals right now. Industrials, Materials, Banks. You also wanna be in travel/restaurants. Energy will rock too, but its kind of dog shit and you can leave it be.\n\nCurve ball though - I'm one of those blind ass tech bulls. I'm not here to tell you that GM is better than TSLA, they aren't. But when you can pay 15x for 100% EPS growth from GM you're going to do that instead of paying 300x for the same rate at Tesla. Same thing with software. I jerk off that business model and the trap door isn't going to fall out, its just not going to do fucking well on a relative basis.\n\nI don't wanna sell my tech shit, but I wanna participate in this reopening lunacy. So how do I do it? Buy shit thats going to do well if some government shut the place down. I'm talking DOCU, PTON, ZM, COUP, OKTA, I dunno, whatever software you want. But balance this shit with long dated calls in reopening stuff. If your calls expiry worthless, your tech shit will be up so much you won't care. If tech is flat to down you'll mint on the calls. I control 16x in shares vs my outlay for the calls, basically the size of the rest of my portfolio in Reopening calls June 21-Jan 22. Sharpe ratio (return/vol) for the last two months is 5.2. Psychologically, the lockdown headlines just aren't doing it anymore. LA, NYC, Chicago, France, Germany, Canada, all locked down, market it looking through it. AZN puts out a garbage vaccine release and value is smoking hot. You'll see more catalysts as these places reopen, first innoculations are announced, general availability, etc. AND cases will start to seasonally decline around March when it gets warmer out. And if you don't think this shit is seasonal, you're dumb. You think we just found the magic in July?
