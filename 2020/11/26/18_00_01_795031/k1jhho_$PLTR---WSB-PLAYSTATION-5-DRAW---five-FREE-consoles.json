{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "# PLTR OVER $30 USD IN EUROPE. FREE TOYS AT THE BOTTOM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWelp my friends. Like 2 days ago I said if Palantir made it to $30 by the end of the year, I\u2019d give out a PS5 to someone in this subreddit.\n\nWhile a 50% gain over 6 weeks sounded aggressive, turns out things are moving a tad faster around here.\n\nLooks like we are over $30 in Europe. Fuck it. Let\u2019s do this draw now. It\u2019s American Thanksgiving after all.\n\n\\--\n\nBut before I live up to my promise and get into the details of how you enter this draw, I think I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t use this opportunity to get my thoughts in about Palantir.\n\n**First and foremost, will everyone who is calling PLTR a quote \u201cmeme stock\u201d shut the hell up?**\n\nJust because a bunch of gorilla IQ memers happen to be buying something, does not mean that the thing they are buying is stupid. All those dingleberries also own Androids and iPhones, does that doesn\u2019t mean Google and Apple are \u201cmeme companies\u201d? No.\n\nUnlike actual meme stocks such as: unprofitable weed companies, camera companies gone pharma, car rental companies gone bankrupt, and little airlines living off corporate welfare - Palantir is actually a ROCK SOLID COMPANY with an extremely promising future.\n\nThis rally was predictable and **it will keep on going in the long run.**\n\nMyself and many others in WSB, r/investing and r/stocks got in on day one - not out of chance - but because we did our due diligence and we could see the writing on the wall: Palantir has the potential to possibly become one of the most important tech companies in the world, and it is being led by people with a track record to back it up.\n\nThis stock isn\u2019t mooning because we have posted 10,000 memes and shit posts. I'm sorry kiddos and Cramer, but our TikTok videos with a few thousand views aren't powerful enough to create $25B of stock market value.\n\nThere is something much larger at play here, and we in WSB are lucky enough to be along for the ride.\n\nPLTR is heading to Mars because the financial institutions didn\u2019t have the opportunity to get in before the IPO and now they are racing to catch up. Moreover, now that **Palantir\u2019s first quarterly report has proven they are the real deal,** and everyone has started googling this pandora\u2019s box of a company - the market is going \u201choly shit\u201d.\n\nThe only question mark that was in Palantir\u2019s path was the impact Joe Biden\u2019s administration might have on the company's relationship with the US government.\n\nWith a former Palantir consultant, Avril Haines, at the helm of the entire US intelligence community as of this week, the risk of the new administration working against Palantir has been all but removed.\n\nThat\u2019s why we are up bigly this week.\n\nBut more importantly, **you need to consider the global technological context of this company, to truly understand its future potential.**\n\n1. In the 90\u2019s PC\u2019s took over.\n2. In the 2000\u2019s it was all about the .coms.\n3. The 2010\u2019s was the era of wireless and mobile platforms.\n4. The 2020's WILL be the decade of smart automation through a global wifi network.\n\nAnd because of that, there is now an information and technology cold war brewing. China and USA are racing to get control of the global internet infrastructure, and they are doing everything they can to invent true AI.\n\nOnce the entire world and everything in your home goes \u201csmart\u201d and becomes connected to Starlink\u2019s grid, someone or some*thing* is going to need to sift through the quintillions of zeroes and ones, to make sense of it all in real time. Guess who is **the only company in the world that has the know-how and business/political connections to fill that void?**\n\nAt the risk of getting too deep in the weeds here, I need to mention one last detail: You all need to read up on Project Maven.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Project Maven is an AI drone project that Google was originally supposed to fulfill for the US Airforce. Google walked from the contract citing \"ethical\" concerns, and then Palantir picked up the pieces. Imagine how pissed the US Airforce was when Google called them unethical and embarrassed them?\n\nThis has a **very** important underlying implication. If you accept the premise that the American government is going ham in this technological revolution, there still remains the question as to who will be the primary benefactor.\n\nCommon sense would suggest that companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft will be working with the US government to create AI. However, Project Maven changed all that.\n\nGoogle's refusal to fulfill their top secret contract taught the government that they cannot trust the trillion dollar megacaps to be unequivocally and unapologetically pro-USA. Those companies are so big, that they don't need to choose a side in geopolitics, and they will almost certainly continue to offer their products to everyone around the world.\n\nWhen it comes to matters of national cybersecurity, the odds are that **the US government is going to put all it's eggs in a company that is unquestionably loyal and patriotic.** When the pentagon is creating a trillion dollar AI behemoth, they know they need to work with someone they can trust when push comes to shove. Palantir is the only AI company that is bold enough to do so, and **their founders have created a special the corporate share structure to ensure they will never lose control**.\n\nSo again, this is not a fucking \"meme stock\".\n\nPLTR is mooning like your pubescent boner on viagra because everyone is starting to realize that this **magnificent titan the CIA created** (*see In-Q-Tel*) has gone public and will probably be at the forefront of the next global technological revolution.\n\nSo:\n\n* Stop worrying about a dip next week. (*Yes it might happen. So what?*)\n* Stop worrying about a price crash post lock up. (*This will happen. But from what price to what price? Who cares?*)\n* Stop trying to time the market to squeeze out an extra $1000. (*We aren\u2019t smart enough or fast enough to win that game.*)\n* Stop viewing Palantir like it\u2019s a penny stock. It\u2019s not.\n\n**Start** looking at the year 2030 and imagine what you will do with your money then, if you grow the man balls (or lady balls) required to hold that long.\n\nHow you handle your positions over the next 6-12 months may be the most important decision of your life: do... not... sell\u2026\n\nThere are only a handful of times in your life when a person should truly go all in: When you meet the person you know you want to marry. When you decide to change your career. And when a company like Palantir goes public.\n\nIn 10 years, you can thank me. Today, I would like to thank you for your time and consideration.\n\nGod speed.\n\n\\--\n\nNow for the fun stuff.\n\n# RULES:\n\n* You must be 18 or older to enter.\n* You must be in a country where you are able to receive shipments from Walmart, Amazon, Bestbuy and/or Gamestop.\n* Your reddit account must be at least 1 week old to claim the prize.\n* There are no financial or trading requirements for this draw.
