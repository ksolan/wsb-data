{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": " My fellow autists,\n\nHappy thanksgiving you retards. Despite 2020 being by far the worst year in a long fucking time, there is plenty to be thankful for. I\u2019m thankful for not being retarded enough to invest in ACB. For those of you less fortunate, let me explain.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t expanded the historical price chart view for ACB to further beyond a month yet, ACB has been on a one-way road down to dumpster land, and for good reason. This does NOT mean it\u2019s prime for a ripping or that it is \u201cundervalued.\u201d \n\n\\*\\*\\* Begin Analysis, feel free to skip \\*\\*\\*\n\nThe company has historically been mismanaged. What once began as a pioneer in the cannabis market has now become the laughing stock of the cannabis giants. While the overall market grows at 30%, ACB has struggled on aligning on an effective sales strategy, even with a new CEO. They\u2019ve historically focused on value (cheap) flower, which has lost demand as it continues to face steeper competition. Shifts to higher premium brands resulted in declines in revenue (ACB is basically the only cannabis company to have declining revenue) despite significantly higher investment costs. ACB\u2019s early enthusiasm resulted in significant capacity that has since been recognized to far exceed demand (currently <20% utilization on its initial capacity), hampered by restrictive international policies around issuance of prescriptions. This excess capacity has resulted in declining cannabis prices, creating a double whammy for ACB.\n\nThese dynamics have led to a woeful financial picture. ACB burns $50-100M in cash a quarter. At least it\u2019s for solid ROI investments right? Well let\u2019s see\u2026revenue went down this year across both medical and recreational as mentioned, gross margins continue to deteriorate (60% to -25%), and the business generates negative $3.4B in net income (and it continues to decline YoY). The last stat is largely due to a \u201cwrite off of a few investments\u201d. What that means is they closed a bunch of facilities, scrapped a shit-ton of inventory, and acknowledged that the companies they bought along the way were way too overvalued. ACB recently had an equity raise at $7.50 / share to raise $125M in an attempt to stay afloat. These processes take a ton of time. Instead of managing the business, management was likely spending most of their time for the past quarter marketing and getting investors to buy this junk. And once that money runs out in a quarter or two, they\u2019ll likely try to do an even more sizeable equity raise (read: even more dilution for shareholders) to any unsophisticated investor willing to listen.\n\nBut what about federal legalization? Sorry to be a Debbie Downer, but it\u2019s not happening anytime soon fellas. Biden has never been about it and I\u2019d bet my left nut that Republicans hold onto the senate. While the democrat\u2019s relatively liberal stance on the issue might allow for more widespread decriminalization, federal approval is needed to Aurora to enter the US THC market due to current regulations. And even on the off chance that marijuana becomes legalized federally, Aurora suffers from such a poor balance sheet that they may not even be able to afford to break into the market and take share from the existing well-capitalized, better run domestic incumbents.\n\nDespite the gross mismanagement of the business, lackluster financial performance, poor regulatory outlook, and the massive drop in stock price over the year(s), the company continues to trade at a whopping 7x TEV/Revenue. Your grandkids will likely be dead before this thing ever sees a dollar on the bottom line). At 7x, the company trades like a high growth SaaS tech company, when in reality the company is on the brink of bankruptcy. It currently has twice as much debt as it does revenue, burns through $300M cash annually as mentioned above, and has only been able to stay afloat recently through equity raises which continue to get increasingly dilutive and unsustainable as the cash burn grows larger and the equity becomes more worthless. There are no debt sources (banks) or other institutional equity investors that would ever lend to this company.\n\n\\*\\*\\* End Rant, Feel free to Skip to Here \\*\\*\\*\n\nFor those of you who skipped the last few paragraphs because there was too much autistic jargon in there, let me explain it to you with an example. Let\u2019s say Pi Phi is the hottest sorority on your campus. If Pi Phi is a proxy for the weed industry, then Aurora is one of the founding members who used to only be kind of hot as she got her bid\u2026.then she got freshman fifteen, and is now about to get the sophomore 30. In an attempt to avoid getting retrohosed, she got lipo from the few willing doctors that were around at the expense of her health and family\u2019s wealth. Unfortunately that lipo is only going to last a semester before it all comes right back. Moral: Go for Pi Phis, just not Aurora\n\nIn case it wasn\u2019t made clear in the above example, this post is not meant to be a negative piece on the cannabis industry. I\u2019m a strong believer in marijuana. It\u2019s a $20B legal, $200B recreational market with a 30% projected revenue CAGR for the next few years. With the farm bill legalizing CBD, the market continues to move closer to decriminalization and legalization. Hell, this took me forever to write because I took a 10mg edible, had 5 snack breaks, and watched three episode of the Office then fell asleep last night before waking up this morning (read: afternoon) to finish writing. I don\u2019t think I need to explain to you all that this is the future. All I\u2019m advocating for is to invest your money in other weed stocks, not ACB because it looks cheap.\n\nAurora has the sporadic 30%-100% stock price jump days. For example: when announcing a new CEO, democrats winning the election, trump conceding the election, and retail FOMO/hedge fund squeezes. None of which did jack for the company fundamentally. But don\u2019t be fooled by these dead cat bounces. You will get burned trying to chase these jumps, and if you\u2019re buying calls, then the frat Vega Delta Theta will surely fuck you after fucking your wife, your wife\u2019s boyfriend, and the non-fat chicks at Pi Phi. \n\nI\u2019m also not advocating you to buy puts on this company. The economics on a put are abysmal, believe me I have one.
