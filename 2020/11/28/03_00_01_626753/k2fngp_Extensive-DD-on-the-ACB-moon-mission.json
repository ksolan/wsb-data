{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Alright, first off. I know a lot of people love to hate on ACB for a variety of reasons. Some of those reasons are more justifiable than others. But regardless of what the company has done in the past, stocks look towards the future. This company is NOT going to go bankrupt. This company is set up for success in the international market for medical and recreational cannabis. Not only are they set up for success, they are in a position to easially become one of the super-powers when it comes to cannabis production. When you think about marijuana laws, we are in the infant stages. There is so much room to grow (no pun intended). Marijuana is not an issue of Red vs. Blue but one of Young vs. Old. As the older generation dies off, there will be the greatest transfer of wealth there has ever been in a single generation (estimated 3 trillion USD). Younger generations will use that money to push for more legislation. As well as dump tons of money into cannabis businesses and stocks. \n\nOnto the business side of things:\n\nIn 2018 they were over bought. Revenues of less than 15 million and valuations of 5-10 billion. The Canadian market was suffocated by the Canadian government retail license lottery (specifically Ontario \\~38% of all Canadians live in Ontario region). From June 2019 to December 2019 they opened less than 9 stores in Ontario. Since Jan 1 2020 - they have authorized over 250 stores....and have doubled the pace of openings to 30-40 stores a month. At that rate....it will STILL take 2.5 years to saturate the market. Overall sales in Canada climbing steadily every single month. Even without US, Mexico, Germany, Europe, Israel; there is a lot of growth left in Canada. Aurora revenue is stalling, why? Bad Products supply issues? They shut down multiple facilities at the start of this year, and 3 months later had a huge surge in demand, leading to many products selling out completely...and they had no means of quickly producing more. Supply issues..caused their miss..not lack of demand in a growing market.\n\nOct. 15 they launched two new vapes - OG Kush and Super Sour Diesel - those two items are number ONE and number TWO sellers of ALL items of ALL brands on OCS every single week since launch. Their edibles sales are growing for them and different flavors of their gummies are top sellers on a regular basis. They launched a new CBD gummy Peach Serene on October 29th and within a week it was also in the top 10 best selling items and remains there every week (just sold out). In early September they launched Blue Dream Pax Era Pod and LA Confidential Pax Era Pod along with 4 flavors of Oral Mist - all of which are selling well and are higher margin products.\n\nSo, we got 2.5 years before Canadian market saturation, sorted out supply issues, Germany sales rising, expanding into Israel (first 4,000 Kilo shipment last week), Mexico close to legalizing, multiple states in US shifting toward some type of legalization which boosts their US CBD business and exposure, 400+ million in cash, reduced expenses massively over last 2 quarters, and gearing up premium brands.
