{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "QuantumScape is a US EV battery developer that just started trading on NYSE yesterday.\n\n**Technology**\n\nQuantumScape was founded in 2010 by Jagdeep Singh who is also the founder of Infinera which is anorther high tech start-up company.\n\nThey are developing solid-state lithium batteries relying on a solid material known as \"solid-state electrolyte\", whereas conventional batteries rely on liquid or gel electrolytes. Solid-state electrolytes allow for a much higher energy density, resulting in a longer range and more importantly in faster-charge times of about 15 minutes.  Since 2010 they spent over 300 Million $ in the development of this technology. \n\nTheir battery technology promises:\n\n* A range of over 300 miles\n* Charging in under 15 minutes\n* Costs per car under 30K$\n* A Battery Lifetime of more than 12 years or over 150,000 miles\n* More safety due to the non-oxidizable solid-state technology\n\nThe fact, that lithium-ion batteries didnt improve their engery density since 2015 is in my point of view the biggest plus. They secured their advancements with over 200 existing and pending patents. \n\n**Financials**\n\nOf course QuantumScape isnt profitable yet, and they dont plan to be cash flow positive until 2027.\n\nThey accumulated a deficit over the years of about 256 Million $ leading to a negative equity. But accumulated deficit/ accumulated profit is as all of us a know a pure accounting figure with no actual cash outflows. The massive pile of retained losses is due to their constant R&D spendings, hopefully resulting in true technological advancements.\n\nQuantumScape has enough cash at hand to repay their non-current liabilites and 3 times the amount of their current liabilities. Additionally, no additional debt financing is planned as they expect to generate 1 billion $ through their NYSE listing through the SPAC Kensington Capital Aquisitions (230 million $ funding, management and board  stacked with  automotive and technology experts).\n\nBased on a forward looking revenue growth modell (20% discount rate) QuantumScape is valued at 3,3 billion $, whilst the current market cap is around 560 milion \n\n**Backing**\n\nQuantomScope is backed by a lot of expierenced decision makers like JB Straubel from Tesla but also with a load of inovative investors. In 2020 the Volkswagen Group announced its plans to increase shareholding in QuantumScape. Volkswagen sees the future in solid-state batteries rather than lithium-ion batteries as they started cooperating with QuantumScape in 2012. QuantumScape and VW established a joint-venture together to equip all VW EVs. VW is currently producing around 11 million cars per year and has plans to launch 70 electric vehicle models by 2029 with an additional spending of 38 billion $ in eletric mobility by 2024.\n\nAdditional investors are Continental, Bill Gates and Breakthrough Energy which is a umbrella for several organizations that are bundling efforts to accelerate innovation in sustainable energy. Members are Jeff Bezoss, Jack Ma, Richard Branson and George Soros among others. \n\nQuantumScope started trading on friday with a gain of roughly 60%. It is expected that many investors are jumping on the boat till the end of the year.\n\n**Sources**\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ev-battery-developer-quantum-scape-begins-trading-on-nyse-153744553.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ev-battery-developer-quantum-scape-begins-trading-on-nyse-153744553.html)\n\n[https://s26.q4cdn.com/263384136/files/doc\\_presentation/QuantumScape-Analyst-Presentation-Oct2020.pdf](https://s26.q4cdn.com/263384136/files/doc_presentation/QuantumScape-Analyst-Presentation-Oct2020.pdf)\n\n[https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/quantumscape-diese-firma-soll-den-durchbruch-fuer-deutsche-e-autos-bringen-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000174211442](https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/quantumscape-diese-firma-soll-den-durchbruch-fuer-deutsche-e-autos-bringen-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000174211442)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/03/bill-gates-backed-ev-battery-supplier-to-go-public-through-spac-deal.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/03/bill-gates-backed-ev-battery-supplier-to-go-public-through-spac-deal.html)\n\n[https://www.quantumscape.com/team/](https://www.quantumscape.com/team/)\n\n[https://electrek.co/2020/11/27/battery-startup-backed-vw-tesla-co-founder-jb-straubel-quantumscape-qs-public/](https://electrek.co/2020/11/27/battery-startup-backed-vw-tesla-co-founder-jb-straubel-quantumscape-qs-public/)\n\n**Positions**:  None unfortunately, I was to fucking slow.", "author_fullname": "t2_3d8qgus7", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "QuantumScape ($QS) EV growth potential with boomer backing", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_k2nz8g", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1606600315.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>QuantumScape is a US EV battery developer that just started trading on NYSE yesterday.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>\n\n<p>QuantumScape was founded in 2010 by Jagdeep Singh who is also the founder of Infinera which is anorther high tech start-up company.</p>\n\n<p>They are developing solid-state lithium batteries relying on a solid material known as &quot;solid-state electrolyte&quot;, whereas conventional batteries rely on liquid or gel electrolytes.
