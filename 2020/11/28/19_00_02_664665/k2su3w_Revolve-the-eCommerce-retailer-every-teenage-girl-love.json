Well, I'm here to show you a great opportunity to hopefully make some tendies.\n\nRevolve is an e-commerce company selling clothes mainly for Millenials and gen-z founded 17 years ago. Revolve works through 2 segments, Revolve and Forward. Revolve sells more premium apparel, footwear, accessories, and beauty products (the average price of clothing is around 100$), FORWARD offers a variety of products from emerging and established luxury brands ( a few thousand dollars for a GUCCI dress).\n\nRevolve is the main moneymaker that uses Instagram/TikTok models, celebrities, and influencers, and big events (like the revolve festival which they produce every year, Coachella which is the biggest festival in America and more) to market their products. As for 2019 marketing expenses were 14% of revenues or 27% of gross profit for the purpose of growing their young customer and retaining them until they will have a name for themselves. They also use algorithms and data that they collected for 17 years to better target, analyze and manage their ads and products. The 17 years of data is quite a lot if you compare it to other e-commerce retailers who are mainly small players who don't have a lot of data or big players that aren't in the e-commerce space or new to it.\n\nThe company has its own warehouse facility and are able to deliver their orders on the same day! this is a huge advantage against small competitors and can be leveraged to retain customers.\n\nin 2018 the company started to expand to the UK, EU, Australia, Asia and Canada. They are expecting to open up also for New Zealand. International sales grew for the 3Q by more than 18% YOY and expected to continue the trend.\n\nNow let's talk numbers:\n\nSince 2016-2019 **revenues** almost doubled, for 2020 revenue I haven't seen guidance from the company but so far recorded revenues of 439.89 million meaning that to show growth this year they will have to record 161 million in revenue which is very likely especially if we will see fewer restrictions. The reason that growth will be very small is that Covid affected social interaction and gathering, which is the main reason people buy clothes, but covid hasn't destroyed their earnings like other retailers because Revolve is only an e-commerce retailer without any physical stores.\n\n**Gross Margin improved to 55.3%** YOY which is great and the main reason for that is that they operate only online.\n\n**Active customers** improved 5% although there were no big events which are the bread and butter of the company, showing a very good resilience for black swans like covid. \n\n**International Sales** grew 18% and represent 20% of net sales for the 3Q which is awesome considering they opened to these markets only 2 years ago.\n\n**Revolve segment Net sales** declined only 4% YOY while Forward grew 9%.\n\n**The company has 159$ cash on the balance sheet** (6 dollars a share) and 0 debt.\n\n**Free Cash Flow** YTD is 74M which is more than double the FCF for 2019 and we still have a quarter to go.\n\nThe company is reducing expenses while keeping the same level of sales, for me it's impressive.\n\n**Average order value** was 232$, an increase from 204$ prior Q but still low compared to 3Q YOY mainly because the customers shift to \"at home\" products like beauty and loungewear which are cheaper than dresses and \"going out\" clothes \n\nTo make a long story short, Revolve is a great company that covid couldn't hurt as nearly as it hurt other retailers. It still has plenty of room to grow and when vaccines will be available this baby will rocket.\n\nBought shares at 20$ and hoping for a correction to buy another 100.", "author_fullname": "t2_5sdl5sn2", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Revolve-the eCommerce retailer every teenage girl love", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_k2su3w", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1606617016.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>whusupp fags, hope everyone enjoys thanksgiving with the family while looking at RH app all day waiting for Monday to arrive.
