For those who don't read version 1, I'm a research scientist with 5+ years working in vaccine R&D and am currently a biomedical PhD candidate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tldr: I think NVAX will have a successful Phase 3 trial and will hit $200 ($12.7B market cap) sometime between January and March.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# DISCUSSION\n\n**NVAX's $8B valuation has not priced-in a successful Phase 3 trial, which I think is close to a guarantee and will happen much sooner than people are expecting**\n\nFirst things first - everything in this post is irrelevant if NVAX's Phase 3 results are poor and do not support emergency use authorization and global licensure. However, I think *NVAX\u2019s Phase 3 UK trial is as close to a slam dunk as possible*. Here's why I'm so confident (refer to first [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) for more details on the science):\n\n* NVAX not only uses the same target antigen as PFE/MRNA/AZN, but it also has superior immunogenicity as evidenced by their Phase 1 data   \\[[1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2026920?query=featured_coronavirus), [2](https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/RACAP_COVID-19_MAP%20Updates.pdf)\\]\n* NVAX has best in class antibody titer data and excellent T cell responses \\[[1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2026920?query=featured_coronavirus), [2](https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/RACAP_COVID-19_MAP%20Updates.pdf)\\]\n* Observed sterilizing immunity in non-human primates despite highest viral challenge dose \\[[3](https://www.novavax.com/sites/default/files/2020-11/NovavaxPresentationforACIP.pdf)\\]\n* Comments from NVAX head of R&D on 24Nov2020 about the release of Phase 3 UK interim data \"we have actually now adjusted our expectations around unblinding (the data) because we have made fairly conservative assumptions. But now it is clear we can expect much higher efficacy\"  [quote at 16:00](https://ir.novavax.com/events/event-details/piper-sandler-virtual-healthcare-conference-fireside-session). ***This is huge revelation that I think has flown under the radar.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll explain more about my thinking about the timing of the interim update, but the short answer is that I think we'll get the first Phase 3 interim readout in mid-December and that the results will be at least as effective as PFE/MRNA, if not a bit better. It's worth mentioning that *at this point in the trial*, the hypothesized superior performance of NVAX will most likely not be apparent (even if it's actually superior) because the 95% mark set by MRNA doesn't leave a lot of room for improvement.\n\nI think one of the reasons that NVAX is viewed as an underdog relative to PFE/MRNA/AZN is due to a lack of awareness that data from the UK Phase 3 trial can be submitted for global licensure and [emergency use authorization](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-granted-fast-track-designation-us-fda). Instead, I think people assume NVAX is much further behind based on the fact that their US Phase 3 trial will start next week. Hopefully I'm right about that misunderstanding because if so, this should rocket once the interim update is made and the market starts putting the pieces together.\n\nBefore going any further talking about valuations, let me just say that yes, I\u2019m aware that NVAX has run up 3000% YTD. However, that represents an increase in market cap of only $7.75B (note that they\u2019ve received $2B in funding). Consider that MRNA \u2013 who has never had a vaccine even enter a [phase 3 trial](https://investors.modernatx.com/static-files/dc121fec-63eb-4794-a2fd-e0d3eadbaa6f)  \u2013 has had a $42B market cap increase in the same period of time with $23B of that increase coming since November 2nd (note that NVAX has increased by $3.65B since November 2nd). Pretty interesting for NVAX if you ask me and supports my hypothesis that NVAX will rocket once data is released and they're viewed as being legitimate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NVAX has supply contracts in place for at least 1.5B doses and the manufacturing capacity to deliver up to 2B doses in 2021 and will generate BILLIONS of dollars of revenue pending successful trial results**\n\nThese are the most up to date numbers that I could find but I would expect additional purchase agreements upon release of phase 3 efficacy data and/or any problems with PFE/MRNA/AZN vaccines:\n\n* UK [agreement](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-uk-government-announce-collaboration-and-purchase) to purchase at least 60M doses with [analyst estimates](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/29/why-novavax-shares-vaulted-higher-today/) that it will bring in up to $1B in revenue\n* OWS [agreement](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-16-billion-funding-operation-warp-speed) for the US to provide 100M doses as part of the $1.6B in funding\n* Japan [agreement](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-takeda-announce-collaboration-novavax-covid-19) to manufacture and provide 250M doses\n* [Agreement](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-canada-reach-agreement-principle-acquire-novavax) with Canada to provide up to 76M doses\n* [Agreement](https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/new-collaboration-makes-further-100-million-doses-covid-19-vaccine-available-low) to provide up to 1B doses to the COVAX buying program\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll the talk about who gets to market first ignores the fact that the world will need billions of doses which can't be individually supplied by any one company and NVAX already has substantial supply agreements in place. Importantly, most of the agreements are contingent on clearing phase 3 trials which once again further increases the importance of the Phase 3 interim results.\n\nThe other key assumption for NVAX to ever be able to reach the $200+ range is that their global network of manufacturing sites will actually be able to deliver on these agreements. To that end, NVAX has [agreements](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing-agreement-serum) with seven different contract manufacturers around the world, including an agreement with the Serum Institute of India who makes more vaccine doses annually than anyone in the world resulting in an annual production capacity of 2B doses/year, significantly more than MRNA or PFE. In addition, NVAX has a much cheaper/faster product to manufacture at scale than either of the mRNA vaccines. It goes without saying, but there's significantly less value in being first to market if you have supply constraints.\n\nNow, you might say even if that\u2019s all going to come to fruition in 2021, this is a one-time event and once everyone is vaccinated that revenue stream is gone. I don\u2019t think that will be the case because COVID is going to become endemic which will probably require that we give boosters to high risk groups, globally. Which brings me to my next point for why I think a $200 price target is well within reason:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In the likely event that annual boosters are needed for a subset of the population, NVAX is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this recurring revenue stream**\n\nOnce the pandemic is over, the difficulty and cost of conducting clinical trials is going to be significantly higher. As a result, the companies that make it through Phase 3 trials this winter will probably end up being the bulk of what\u2019s on the menu for booster shots in the future.\n\nI think NVAX will be in a great position to be the vaccine of choice for boosting not only because I think it will have clear superior efficacy and favorable distribution/cost, but also because all of the competitors have important limitations in this context:\n\n* AZN/JNJ\u2019s vaccines both induce an immune response against the viral vector itself, almost certainly preventing them from being able to be used for boosting.\n* PFE/MRNA are expensive and more [painful](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/23/covid-vaccine-cdc-should-warn-people-the-side-effects-from-shots-wont-be-walk-in-the-park-.html) than typical vaccines and my sense is that people aren't going to choose to them if there are alternatives available.\n\nAnother key point in favor of NVAX is that their trials have put more emphasis on enrollment of elderly and of patients with [comorbidities](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-initiates-efficacy-trial-covid-19-vaccine-south-africa), both of whom will likely be recommended to get booster shots.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NVAX successfully completed a Phase 3 trial for their influenza vaccine (NanoFlu) just before the pandemic started and may end up as the only company with a combination COVID-Flu shot for the foreseeable future**\n\nAlthough everyone rightly points out that NVAX never brought a vaccine to market, they did however successfully complete a Phase 3 trial for their NanoFlu vaccine just before the pandemic started. They shifted focus to COVID but will be submitting a BLA for [NanoFlu](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-appoints-leadership-team-advance-nanoflu-through), which if approved, will compete in the multi-billion dollar global flu vaccine market with significant revenue potential.\n\nThe important point to understand is that NanoFlu uses the same platform, formulation, and adjuvant as their COVID vaccine making a combination vaccine very feasible from a manufacturing and regulatory standpoint. This could be a huge money maker and they\u2019ll now have the revenue/cash from other activities to be able to fund the development of such a vaccine. A combination COVID/Flu vaccine for the mRNA/vector platforms will be almost impossible for several reasons that will take way too long to explain, but it\u2019s not on the radar for them. Sanofi could create a combination flu shot with their COVID vaccine but their COVID vaccine candidate uses a different adjuvant than their marketed Flu shot.\n\nIt's worth addressing the fact that prior to COVID, Novavax didn't have the greatest reputation. Although this was deserved in many ways, some of the criticism ignores the staggering costs and complexities of vaccine development. There's a reason that only a handful of companies make vaccines and they're all very well funded. In my opinion, Novavax's setbacks were not a reflection on the quality of their technology and I think they were actually turning the corner prior to COVID. Either way, whatever you think about their past, Novavax is now in an unbelievably fortunate situation flush with cash and in possession of an extremely valuable vaccine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Catalyst timing**\n\nNVAX\u2019s original clinical trial protocol stated that their first interim update would be triggered once 66 events are recorded at which point the data is un-blinded and the first efficacy assessment is made. But given this new caveat from Dr. Glenn about having a peak at efficacy data sooner, my guess is that we'll get the first look at efficacy data in mid-December ([quote at 16:00](https://ir.novavax.com/events/event-details/piper-sandler-virtual-healthcare-conference-fireside-session)).\n\nThe challenge in trying to trade this interim announcement is that there will almost definitely be a couple of negative [catalysts](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/11/28/america-will-be-the-first-country-to-roll-out-a-covid-19-vaccine) for NVAX in December, as the FDA will meet to decide about emergency use authorization for Pfizer on December 10th and for Moderna on December 17th. For all the reasons I outlined, I think these are both immaterial to NVAX\u2019s outlook, but the announcements could trigger an overreaction and some selling. On one hand this could create a nice buying opportunity, but that might hurt if you're holding 1DTE options. I don\u2019t know what the right answer is here, but my thought is that the interim update will greatly outweigh any negative effects of the EUA meetings and that's how I plan to play it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Positions**\n\nCurrent holdings\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jrwcpvbe35261.png?width=1251&format=png&auto=webp&s=f49c3cd400a04b95a2d2b700b527df45b0edf4d6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gf27arjg35261.png?width=1458&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b683da91f562c245855d87218a510784776e69d\n\nRealized gains\n\n[Left a lot of money on the table by not holding these from my original post](https://preview.redd.it/e0d1yl0i35261.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf52db725e6c53db8c019c5afb59c60025ce4fcf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time.

For those who don&#39;t read version 1, I&#39;m a research scientist with 5+ years working in vaccine R&amp;D and am currently a biomedical PhD candidate.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>tldr: I think NVAX will have a successful Phase 3 trial and will hit $200 ($12.7B market cap) sometime between January and March.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>DISCUSSION</h1>\n\n<p><strong>NVAX&#39;s $8B valuation has not priced-in a successful Phase 3 trial, which I think is close to a guarantee and will happen much sooner than people are expecting</strong></p>\n\n<p>First things first - everything in this post is irrelevant if NVAX&#39;s Phase 3 results are poor and do not support emergency use authorization and global licensure. However, I think <em>NVAX\u2019s Phase 3 UK trial is as close to a slam dunk as possible</em>. Here&#39;s why I&#39;m so confident (refer to first <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\">post</a> for more details on the science):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>NVAX not only uses the same target antigen as PFE/MRNA/AZN, but it also has superior immunogenicity as evidenced by their Phase 1 data   [<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2026920?query=featured_coronavirus\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/RACAP_COVID-19_MAP%20Updates.pdf\">2</a>]</li>\n<li>NVAX has best in class antibody titer data and excellent T cell responses [<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2026920?query=featured_coronavirus\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/RACAP_COVID-19_MAP%20Updates.pdf\">2</a>]</li>\n<li>Observed sterilizing immunity in non-human primates despite highest viral challenge dose [<a href=\"https://www.novavax.com/sites/default/files/2020-11/NovavaxPresentationforACIP.pdf\">3</a>]</li>\n<li>Comments from NVAX head of R&amp;D on 24Nov2020 about the release of Phase 3 UK interim data &quot;we have actually now adjusted our expectations around unblinding (the data) because we have made fairly conservative assumptions. But now it is clear we can expect much higher efficacy&quot;  <a href=\"https://ir.novavax.com/events/event-details/piper-sandler-virtual-healthcare-conference-fireside-session\">quote at 16:00</a>. <strong><em>This is huge revelation that I think has flown under the radar.</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll explain more about my thinking about the timing of the interim update, but the short answer is that I think we&#39;ll get the first Phase 3 interim readout in mid-December and that the results will be at least as effective as PFE/MRNA, if not a bit better. It&#39;s worth mentioning that <em>at this point in the trial</em>, the hypothesized superior performance of NVAX will most likely not be apparent (even if it&#39;s actually superior) because the 95% mark set by MRNA doesn&#39;t leave a lot of room for improvement.</p>\n\n<p>I think one of the reasons that NVAX is viewed as an underdog relative to PFE/MRNA/AZN is due to a lack of awareness that data from the UK Phase 3 trial can be submitted for global licensure and <a href=\"https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-granted-fast-track-designation-us-fda\">emergency use authorization</a>. Instead, I think people assume NVAX is much further behind based on the fact that their US Phase 3 trial will start next week. Hopefully I&#39;m right about that misunderstanding because if so, this should rocket once the interim update is made and the market starts putting the pieces together.</p>\n\n<p>Before going any further talking about valuations, let me just say that yes, I\u2019m aware that NVAX has run up 3000% YTD. However, that represents an increase in market cap of only $7.75B (note that they\u2019ve received $2B in funding). Consider that MRNA \u2013 who has never had a vaccine even enter a <a href=\"https://investors.modernatx.com/static-files/dc121fec-63eb-4794-a2fd-e0d3eadbaa6f\">phase 3 trial</a>  \u2013 has had a $42B market cap increase in the same period of time with $23B of that increase coming since November 2nd (note that NVAX has increased by $3.65B since November 2nd). Pretty interesting for NVAX if you ask me and supports my hypothesis that NVAX will rocket once data is released and they&#39;re viewed as being legitimate.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>NVAX has supply contracts in place for at least 1.5B doses and the manufacturing capacity to deliver up to 2B doses in 2021 and will generate BILLIONS of dollars of revenue pending successful trial results</strong></p>\n\n<p>These are the most up to date numbers that I could find but I would expect additional purchase agreements upon release of phase 3 efficacy data and/or any problems with PFE/MRNA/AZN vaccines:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>UK <a href=\"https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-uk-government-announce-collaboration-and-purchase\">agreement</a> to purchase at least 60M doses with <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/29/why-novavax-shares-vaulted-higher-today/\">analyst estimates</a> that it will bring in up to $1B in revenue</li>\n<li>OWS <a href=\"https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-16-billion-funding-operation-warp-speed\">agreement</a> for the US to provide 100M doses as part of the $1.6B in funding</li>\n<li>Japan <a href=\"https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-takeda-announce-collaboration-novavax-covid-19\">agreement</a> to manufacture and provide 250M doses</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-canada-reach-agreement-principle-acquire-novavax\">Agreement</a> with Canada to provide up to 76M doses</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/new-collaboration-makes-further-100-million-doses-covid-19-vaccine-available-low\">Agreement</a> to provide up to 1B doses to the COVAX buying program</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>All the talk about who gets to market first ignores the fact that the world will need billions of doses which can&#39;t be individually supplied by any one company and NVAX already has substantial supply agreements in place. Importantly, most of the agreements are contingent on clearing phase 3 trials which once again further increases the importance of the Phase 3 interim results.</p>\n\n<p>The other key assumption for NVAX to ever be able to reach the $200+ range is that their global network of manufacturing sites will actually be able to deliver on these agreements. To that end, NVAX has <a href=\"https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing-agreement-serum\">agreements</a> with seven different contract manufacturers around the world, including an agreement with the Serum Institute of India who makes more vaccine doses annually than anyone in the world resulting in an annual production capacity of 2B doses/year, significantly more than MRNA or PFE. In addition, NVAX has a much cheaper/faster product to manufacture at scale than either of the mRNA vaccines. It goes without saying, but there&#39;s significantly less value in being first to market if you have supply constraints.</p>\n\n<p>Now, you might say even if that\u2019s all going to come to fruition in 2021, this is a one-time event and once everyone is vaccinated that revenue stream is gone. I don\u2019t think that will be the case because COVID is going to become endemic which will probably require that we give boosters to high risk groups, globally. Which brings me to my next point for why I think a $200 price target is well within reason:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>In the likely event that annual boosters are needed for a subset of the population, NVAX is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this recurring revenue stream</strong></p>\n\n<p>Once the pandemic is over, the difficulty and cost of conducting clinical trials is going to be significantly higher. As a result, the companies that make it through Phase 3 trials this winter will probably end up being the bulk of what\u2019s on the menu for booster shots in the future.</p>\n\n<p>I think NVAX will be in a great position to be the vaccine of choice for boosting not only because I think it will have clear superior efficacy and favorable distribution/cost, but also because all of the competitors have important limitations in this context:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>AZN/JNJ\u2019s vaccines both induce an immune response against the viral vector itself, almost certainly preventing them from being able to be used for boosting.</li>\n<li>PFE/MRNA are expensive and more <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/23/covid-vaccine-cdc-should-warn-people-the-side-effects-from-shots-wont-be-walk-in-the-park-.html\">painful</a> than typical vaccines and my sense is that people aren&#39;t going to choose to them if there are alternatives available.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Another key point in favor of NVAX is that their trials have put more emphasis on enrollment of elderly and of patients with <a href=\"https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-initiates-efficacy-trial-covid-19-vaccine-south-africa\">comorbidities</a>, both of whom will likely be recommended to get booster shots.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>NVAX successfully completed a Phase 3 trial for their influenza vaccine (NanoFlu) just before the pandemic started and may end up as the only company with a combination COVID-Flu shot for the foreseeable future</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although everyone rightly points out that NVAX never brought a vaccine to market, they did however successfully complete a Phase 3 trial for their NanoFlu vaccine just before the pandemic started. They shifted focus to COVID but will be submitting a BLA for <a href=\"https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-appoints-leadership-team-advance-nanoflu-through\">NanoFlu</a>, which if approved, will compete in the multi-billion dollar global flu vaccine market with significant revenue potential.</p>\n\n<p>The important point to understand is that NanoFlu uses the same platform, formulation, and adjuvant as their COVID vaccine making a combination vaccine very feasible from a manufacturing and regulatory standpoint. This could be a huge money maker and they\u2019ll now have the revenue/cash from other activities to be able to fund the development of such a vaccine. A combination COVID/Flu vaccine for the mRNA/vector platforms will be almost impossible for several reasons that will take way too long to explain, but it\u2019s not on the radar for them. Sanofi could create a combination flu shot with their COVID vaccine but their COVID vaccine candidate uses a different adjuvant than their marketed Flu shot.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s worth addressing the fact that prior to COVID, Novavax didn&#39;t have the greatest reputation. Although this was deserved in many ways, some of the criticism ignores the staggering costs and complexities of vaccine development. There&#39;s a reason that only a handful of companies make vaccines and they&#39;re all very well funded. In my opinion, Novavax&#39;s setbacks were not a reflection on the quality of their technology and I think they were actually turning the corner prior to COVID. Either way, whatever you think about their past, Novavax is now in an unbelievably fortunate situation flush with cash and in possession of an extremely valuable vaccine.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>Catalyst timing</strong></p>\n\n<p>NVAX\u2019s original clinical trial protocol stated that their first interim update would be triggered once 66 events are recorded at which point the data is un-blinded and the first efficacy assessment is made. But given this new caveat from Dr. Glenn about having a peak at efficacy data sooner, my guess is that we&#39;ll get the first look at efficacy data in mid-December (<a href=\"https://ir.novavax.com/events/event-details/piper-sandler-virtual-healthcare-conference-fireside-session\">quote at 16:00</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The challenge in trying to trade this interim announcement is that there will almost definitely be a couple of negative <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/11/28/america-will-be-the-first-country-to-roll-out-a-covid-19-vaccine\">catalysts</a> for NVAX in December, as the FDA will meet to decide about emergency use authorization for Pfizer on December 10th and for Moderna on December 17th. For all the reasons I outlined, I think these are both immaterial to NVAX\u2019s outlook, but the announcements could trigger an overreaction and some selling. On one hand this could create a nice buying opportunity, but that might hurt if you&#39;re holding 1DTE options. I don\u2019t know what the right answer is here, but my thought is that the interim update will greatly outweigh any negative effects of the EUA meetings and that&#39;s how I plan to play it.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>Positions</strong></p>\n\n<p>Current holdings</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jrwcpvbe35261.png?width=1251&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f49c3cd400a04b95a2d2b700b527df45b0edf4d6\">https://preview.redd.it/jrwcpvbe35261.png?width=1251&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f49c3cd400a04b95a2d2b700b527df45b0edf4d6</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gf27arjg35261.png?width=1458&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b683da91f562c245855d87218a510784776e69d\">https://preview.redd.it/gf27arjg35261.png?width=1458&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b683da91f562c245855d87218a510784776e69d</a></p>\n\n<p>Realized gains</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/e0d1yl0i35261.png?width=1244&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf52db725e6c53db8c019c5afb59c60025ce4fcf\">Left a lot of money on the table by not holding these from my original post</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your time.
