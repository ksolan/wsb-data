{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "you fucking autists, im gonna bring you some tendies on a bet on steel. My dumbed down version of US Steel (at $11) didnt seem to get into your peanut brains so here is a wall of text to fuck you up and buy US STEEL for another 300% upside\n\ntl;dr: Buy United States Steel (NYSE: X). OTM calls from Jan to Apr 21. \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80 \n\nedit: btw since you autists like short squeeze without catalysts, X is 20% shorted with a clear as fuck path to explosion. \n\nUnited States Steel (NYSE: X, $14/share) allows us to participate in a supply squeeze in the tight US Steel market, with multiple ways to win. X operates blast furnaces which are gradually losing share to nimbler, cost-efficient mini-mills. X is currently unprofitable, following covid and plant shutdown. Trading at 0.6x P/B, it is often use as a levered \u2013 ops, financial - proxy to steel prices.\n\n**The bet on X is predicated on a squeeze on the US steel supply.** There are two levels of supply that has been severely curtailed due to covid. First is on the metal service centres (distributor of finished steel), which has reduced steel inventory in anticipation of weak demand. Second is on the steel manufacturers (US Steel, AK Steel, ArcelorMittal, Stelco, JWS Steel), which have idled plants to trim costs. It typically takes time to repair steelworks, rehire workers and to restart a plant. What also been additionally unfortunate is that Arcelor\u2019s Burning Harbour furnace (1-2mt of steel) had covid infections, leading to outages. Altogether, the set-up is a super tight supply chain holding a historical low 1.5 month of steel inventory (2.5 to 3 months) and no capacity.\n\n**In face of this tightness, demand is recovering very sharply.** Americans\u2019 demand for cars are recovering, construction has picked up and industrial activity coming back online. Shipments have rose 1-5% month on month, and because supply has been unable to pick up, manufacturers must now book steel supply about 11 to 13 weeks out (vs 4-8 weeks in a normal supply environment), and most operational mills running at close to 100% capacity; merchants looking for generic steel have been unable to find any seller, according to market surveys.\n\n**Steel prices have inflected but demand pressure is unlikely to abate.** Spot prices rose from $400 to $750 just last week, with higher futures pricing in further increase of steel prices to $760 to $800, before easing to $600 over the course of FY21. Current demand drivers are still recovering with additional legs of steel demand \u2013 Biden\u2019s infrastructure bill, recent import quota on Brazilian semi-finished steel and rising steel demand globally. In fact, even at $800/ton, US steel is still trading at a discount to international steel. From industry surveys, only 10% of mill players are even willing to negotiate price (vs 50-80% historically), with most sold out till Jan / Feb.\n\nX at $3.2bn mrkt cap, $7bn EV is trading at 0.9x P/B, 3-4x EV/EBITDA with a heavily battered balance sheet. In normal times, integrated players are an easy structural short owing to oversupply and zero capital discipline in the industry. US Steel has long been an unsexy sector that is de-growth, cyclical, value-driven (which is out of favour), capital blackhole and especially struck out in times of covid. Industry utilisation is at 70% (from 54-55% pre-covid) with a constant threat from lower cost imports. Need I continue further? This is also why even when steel prices shot up post Q3, estimates for X remain flattish.\n\nBut, in face of a supply squeeze, the highest cost producer with swing capacity represents a levered bet on the upside; Every $100/ton realized price increment gives rise to +$200mm EBITDA each quarter (2mm as of Q3, total capacity 22mt, 6mt idled) and prices have already run up >$200 since 20Q3 ended, even +10% since vaccine announced. A good reference would be 2017 to 2018, when 232 Tariffs led to a panic buy amongst metal service centres, sending steel prices to +150% to $1,200/t. US Steel, in the same period, rerated from <1x P/B to >4x. **The same narrative marks X today.**\n\n**A key risk is supply response, which will dampen the short squeeze.** Noticeably, Nucor and STLD have new capacity coming online in 21H1 and H2. Stelco and US Steel have also invested, following the windfall from 232 tariffs. However, most of these supply would come online >6 months out, which won\u2019t be in time for the squeeze. Shuttered capacity has mostly been from US Steel and ArcelorMittal.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\"Another service center source serving the automotive industry said he had received a call earlier in the week about a panicked automotive OEM. The OEM was about to shutdown an assembly plant if it could not get the less than 1,000 st of steel it needed, according to the source.\n\nThe service center source said he expected it to be an exotic, hard to find automotive grade of steel but was shocked to learn it was one of the more generic grades of steel. The OEM was unable to find it anywhere and every service center contacted was out of stock and still waiting on orders from domestic mills.\n\n\"We are forecasting now that we will run out of inventory on some jobs by mid-January. We just can't get enough to build any inventory or safety stock. We are begging and appealing constantly for more tons and the orders we do have are all late, adding more stress,\" said a Midwest fabricator with automotive ties.\"\n\nSource: S&P Global Platts, November 2020 survey\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0km3wazd16261.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a954042b5b77b21ecef4075d2d72f3ebdd39211", "author_fullname": "t2_xl9wv", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Squeeze on Steel", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 59, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "media_metadata": {"0km3wazd16261": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 46, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0km3wazd16261.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=77f97882c8354e94121a54093b28e0be2e326ca1"}, {"y": 92, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0km3wazd16261.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=17a969d88d6b244b58c2710f2db294f8552d5ef2"}, {"y": 136, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0km3wazd16261.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=1eceeca4c45f32852ae671b3fd5d1d2b5947285e"}], "s": {"y": 217, "x": 508, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0km3wazd16261.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a954042b5b77b21ecef4075d2d72f3ebdd39211"}, "id": "0km3wazd16261"}}, "name": "t3_k380yz", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/XD6_vCa52qBFfcoTEaJGiDW4KOZnZ7UMOTBznQuk7YM.jpg", "edited": 1606653182.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1606678638.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>you fucking autists, im gonna bring you some tendies on a bet on steel.
