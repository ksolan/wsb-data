Despite a lot of noise and speculation (if one were to go looking), the major news outlets and press have been quiet. This DD makes the argument (based on the available evidence) that Bill Ackman\u2019s blank cheque company, PSTH, will announce a merger with Stripe, securing a \\~20% position in the company and taking it public.\n\nThis can be discredited as conjecture, but most things on WSB can be and are before they are realized. There is simply too much evidence here in favor of this happening to be ignored any longer.\n\nKey Information/Timeline of Events:\n\n\\- In July 2020, Bill Ackman went live with SPAC $PSTH \u2013 the SPAC raised $4B in proceeds making it the biggest SPAC ever.\n\n\\- The SPAC is designed very differently than others and incentivizes long term holding. Upon purchase of one common share and holding of that share through announcement and merger, owners receive 2/9 of a warrant with a strike of $23. Those who buy and sell on announcement bounce therefore give up that 2/9 and it goes back into the pool for those who hold through merger. What a lot of people are missing is what this means. It means that the ceiling for the value of that fractional merger is unknown but at minimum is 2/9. If there was a minority sell off on announcement that 2/9 could increase to 3/9 or 4/9 warrant for those who stay in. This creates a wild incentive for long term holding of the company and is referenced in the \"tontine\" name - look it up, pretty cool.\n\n\\- Ackman has given several interviews since the listing of PSTH arguing that they are very well positioned to target and capture a unicorn (large cap, well run, asset light, family owned, high moat, company.) Early speculation included AirBnB. While Ackman held talks with the company, they didn\u2019t get to the point where his people got an inside look at the financials and he basically said they had no idea what they were dealing with despite liking how the company looked on the outside. \n\n\\- Ackman in the same videos talked up Stripe as a quality company but one not ready to go public, specifically citing managerial deficits.\n\n\\- Stripe has been talked up by some in the press as the next Google. They control a large percentage of online payments at present.\n\n\\- Ackman has publicly disclosed his biggest misses as companies that make money based on money, giving Visa/Mastercard as the obvious example.\n\n\\- In the weeks since those interviews, several key events have taken place as follows:\n\no Following Ackman comments, Stripe initiates a dramatic position filling hiring spree with focus on positions needed to go public/SPAC\n\no Square executive joins board of PSTH\n\no Seth Klarman ($30B hedge fund manager \u201cthe next Buffet\u201d and noted value investor, disclosed a $400M position in PSTH).\n\no  Guuggenheim buys 22,000,000 $PSTH shares\n\no Warren Buffet has slashed his JPM position almost entirely potentially signifying a shift towards fintech. With online sales through the roof (this is just getting press in the last 2-3 days in earnest), he could be making a final gigantic long-term play for $BRK before he passes away). What better choice than a money maker based on money.\n\no Warren Buffet is secretly building a large position and hiding it from the press/pushing filing deadlines as much as possible. $BRK on record saying they want in on energy or tech giant.\n\no There is a large and undisclosed PSTH somewhere in the market that is not Klarman\u2019s.\n\no In recent days the pre-market movement has been very odd. Several million positions. Pre-market on Friday for example, stock was up nearly 9% for some of the morning. Has consistently hit after-market highs the next day. The data is trending in a very clear direction.\n\nRelevant Documents/Links:\n\n\\- Ackman interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmaCarSyBk4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmaCarSyBk4)\n\n\\- Klarman position: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-does-seth-klarman-pershing-165111126.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-does-seth-klarman-pershing-165111126.html)\n\n\\- Guggenheim position: [https://whalewisdom.com/schedule13d/view/guggenheim-capital-llc-sc-13g-2020-08-10-psthu](https://whalewisdom.com/schedule13d/view/guggenheim-capital-llc-sc-13g-2020-08-10-psthu)\n\n\\- Buffet leaves JPM: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-built-8-billion-jpmorgan-stake-slashed-2020-11-1029846193](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-built-8-billion-jpmorgan-stake-slashed-2020-11-1029846193)\n\n\\- Buffet secret position: [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/warren-buffett-could-be-building-a-secret-position.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/warren-buffett-could-be-building-a-secret-position.html)\n\n\\- PSTH (Ackman) recent letter to investors, see PSTH section: [https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2020/08/28125504/Pershing-Square-Holdings-Ltd.-June-2020-Interim.pdf](https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2020/08/28125504/Pershing-Square-Holdings-Ltd.-June-2020-Interim.pdf)\n\n\\- Yolo Capital Mgmt twitter feed outlining much of the same events: [https://twitter.com/yolocapitalmgmt](https://twitter.com/yolocapitalmgmt)\n\nIn the end, we don\u2019t know anything for sure but the evidence here (there is more to dig up, see [u/YOLO](https://new.reddit.com/u/YOLO/), is very compelling).
