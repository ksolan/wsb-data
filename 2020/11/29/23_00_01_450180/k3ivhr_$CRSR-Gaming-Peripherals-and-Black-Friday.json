Gaming peripherals are relatively inexpensive gifts that are going to be wrapped under the tree for millions of children to open on Christmas morning.\n\nFor Corsair Gaming $CRSR the sales of gaming peripherals in the third quarter [grew 128.8% year-over-year](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2123626/0/en/Corsair-Gaming-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html). Sales of these items are a cash cow for producers because of their high margins (For Corsair, gaming peripherals had a [37.1% gross profit margin](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2123626/0/en/Corsair-Gaming-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html) in the third quarter compared to a [23% gross profit margin](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2123626/0/en/Corsair-Gaming-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html) for gaming systems). Due to tailwinds in supply-chain efficiency, these products are becoming even more profitable for Corsair (gross profit margin on gaming peripherals [grew 31.1% year-over-year](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2123626/0/en/Corsair-Gaming-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html) in the third quarter). Increased sales and growing margins led to Corsair's whopping [200.8% year-over-year growth](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2123626/0/en/Corsair-Gaming-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html) in gross profit from gaming peripherals.\n\nCorsair has estimated that Q4 revenue will be between [$470M and $485M.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2123626/0/en/Corsair-Gaming-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html). \n\nNow, let's look back at how Corsair's revenue has typically grown due to Christmas shopping (Data compiled from [Q3 Report](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2123626/0/en/Corsair-Gaming-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html) and [S-1 Filing](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/93418f4d-ffd9-42da-930e-c1f3a9fc1fb6)). In the fourth quarter of 2019, revenue grew 14.8% from revenue in the third quarter of 2019. If a 2020 has the same 14.8% growth from the third quarter, then Q4 revenue will be $525M, exceeding even the high end of current Q4 estimates. Revenue in the last six months of 2018 grew 8.0% from the revenue in the first six months of 2018. Revenue in the last six months of 2019 grew 25.6% from the revenue in the first six months of 2019. If 2020 follows a similar trend, then revenue in the last six months of 2020 will be 43.3% higher than the first six months of 2020, and Q4 revenue will be $530M, which exceeds even the high end of current Q4 estimates\n\nThe forecast looks great for Corsair exceeding their Q4 estimates, but what does this mean for their stock price? CRSR has recently fallen over 24% from its ATH of $51.37 after rising 80% over a span of eight trading days. This pullback is creating a buying opportunity before record Black Friday and Cyber Monday online sales numbers are released. CRSR 5/21/21 $50 calls have fallen from their high of $15 and CRSR 5/31/31 $40 calls have fallen from their high of $19. Gradually entering a position in these can lead to an outsized return as online sales numbers and the Q4 report in February drive the stock price up.\n\nTL;DR $CRSR 5/21/21 $40c and $CRSR 5/21/21 $50c", "author_fullname": "t2_8czit4ng", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "$CRSR, Gaming Peripherals and Black Friday", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_k3ivhr", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": true, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1606717826.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s no surprise to anyone that the pandemic has led to rapid growth in the sales of Gaming PCs.
