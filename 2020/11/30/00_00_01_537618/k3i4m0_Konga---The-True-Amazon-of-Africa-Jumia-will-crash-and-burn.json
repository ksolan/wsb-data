Declining revenues during a pandemic where online shopping has increased and all ecommerce giants have posted recorded setting revenues and profits. (revenue decline can also be attributed to loss of market share to Konga)\n2. Gross merchandise value down 15% year over year. IE the total value of all merchandise has decreased 15% from prior year.\n3. Business mix - to offset the decrease in merchandise sales they have expanded to food delivery, Jumiapay and Gaming. While introducing all these new product mixes their revenue has still declined 9% from the prior year. All these sectors will require cash injections to have any possibility to generate revenue.\n4. Competition Konga - Jumia is no longer the main player in Africa. Konga has seen explosive growth since 2018 when it was acquired by Zinox Group. Posting 800% increase in sales and reducing losses by 70% in a 18 month period. They are already exceeding 1 million in daily sales (2.5x Jumia currently daily sales) and plan to hit over 3B in sales by 2024. They have been eyeing a IPO with a value of 3 Billion. Once this company does IPO investors will flee from Jumia into Konga as their revenue growth cannot be ignored. On purely a revenue valuation Jumia should be at 1.2B compared to Konga's 3.2B valuation and this is not considering Konga's revenue growth and improved margins. Konga is actively looking to expand into all english speaking western African markets over the next couple of years.\n\n5. Potential Market - While Africa does have a population of 1.5 billion people, there are over 50 different countries most of which have awful infrastructure. Whether it be roads, addresses or even the internet. This is evident as last year they decided to close down distribution centers in 5 different countries last year due to unprofitability. (Cameroon, Tanzania, Gabon, Congo, Rwanda Ect) Management continues to make irresponsible decisions that just increases Jumia's burn rate, not to mention once a company pulls out of a country it has a much harder time penetrating it in the future.\n\n6. Cash Burn Rate - JMIA is burning through cash, net cash position of 100m as of 09/30/2020 after trade payables come due. Cash Burn rate of 182m per year in 2019, leaving JMIA with enough cash until March-April 2021.\n\n7. Shelf offering registration - In July 2020 they registered for a shelf offering which allows JMIA to issue up to 36 million shares when they deem necessary to secure funds. This offering will come prior to March 2021, it may happen even sooner if they are trying to expand operations and continue entering into new product lines.\n\n8.Citron Pump: Citron put out a pump article. Look at their short report in May 2019 where they shorted this stock from 45$ to $5. Nothing has changed in this company with the exception of decreased revenue, a worsening cash position. Citron Loaded up on this stock in the 15$ range and will dump their holdings and short it back down, making money on the way up and down like they always do. See $LRN for their most recent stock pump. All Citron does is load up on short float stocks and put out pump articles or short rallying stocks/hot sectors and release hit pieces.\n\n9. Insider selling: Cofounders - Jeremy and Sacha sold off 400k shares last week. If insiders are selling at these prices, institutional investors will be to. Some institutions have had their funds locked up since IPO and will be selling their positions as volume and price increase.\n\nDec 18 $25 Puts", "author_fullname": "t2_iqja2", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Konga - The True Amazon of Africa, Jumia will crash and burn", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_k3i4m0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1606715401.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><ol>\n<li>9% revenue decline year over year: 147m 2020 vs 161m 2019.
