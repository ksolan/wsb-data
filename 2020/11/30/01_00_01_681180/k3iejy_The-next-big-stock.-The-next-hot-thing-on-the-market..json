Yes JMIA, you\u2019ve probably never heard of it\u2026 But lemme just say that it\u2019s a fucking gold mine in an underdeveloped market. \n\nOk, imma quickly explain why the company is undervalued and even more than that \u2013 the company is underhyped. \n\nJumia is basically an African version of Amazon. It\u2019s taking the already proven e-Commerce business model and taking it to an underdeveloped African market. What I\u2019m saying here is, that it basically has huge growth potential. It\u2019s already in a strong position to dominate Africa, as it already represents most of the online sales on the continent, but as you\u2019ll see it\u2019s just gonna get better. \n\nAfrica has about $4.0 trillion in household spending - similar to South America ($4.8 trillion). Most of the spending is still offline (like in the US before Amazon), but as Africa\u2019s internet usage is gonna start increasing, a lot of spending is gonna start moving to an online platform (Jumia). The closest example to an e-Commerce platform that grew recently in an emerging market is Mercado Libre, which grew in South America. Obviously, the challenges in South America and Africa are different in many ways as Africa is probably worse in terms of infrastructure, but in terms of opportunity, they're not that different.\n\nMercado Libre is currently valued at $75 billion, which could get a lot bigger in the future, but if you look at Jumia, it is only valued at $3 billion. The companies are obviously at a much different stage. Mercado Libre has 175 million users and Jumia is only at 6.8 million users, but take into consideration the massive amount of user growth year over year and the fact that Africa is projected to have the fastest-growing population between now and 2050, the growth of the platform is gonna be big. It's hard to not see Jumia moving in the direction of Mercado Libre. Obviously, Jumia is an early-stage company, but people do not buy based on current numbers, they buy based on future numbers. And based on future numbers, the company is extremely undervalued. \n\nNow that we\u2019ve got some basic DD out of the way, imma get to the main point. I do think, as stated above, that this is a valuable company and I believe in its domination in the African market over the next 20 to 30 years, but we are not investors, we are traders, so why bother with the next 20 to 30 years you might ask. The reason that I'm talking about this now is that I think this is a very, very powerful story to sell to investors and I\u2019d say that we are about a couple of away, before it really starts getting sold to the investors. We\u2019re here before the hype. Before the major investors start hoarding in. Once it gets noticed either by investors or one of the already existing e-Commerce like Amazon or Alibaba, the stock is gonna start mooning. \n\nIf Jumia is gonna keep up the numbers, big investors are gonna start coming in.
