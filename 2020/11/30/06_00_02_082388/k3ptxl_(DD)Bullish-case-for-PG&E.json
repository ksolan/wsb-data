But for the sake of diversification it doesnt hurt to look and see where there are more tendies to be had.\nPG&E Has had a rough ride but it is through the fire at this point. Pun intended. So Im gonna lay out some key reasonings as to why Im bullish on PCG and you should be too.\n\n1. They are a monopoly on power distribution in the most expensive places to live in the world.\n\n2. Before covid they were on the rise, because of the fires they have been left behind as every other stock is back to pre covid levels. This alone should be a massive bullish case\n\n3. Looking at the 52 week chart, **exactly one year ago PCG went on an absolutely insane bull run FROM $7 TO $18.** At some point this shit is gonna happen again.\n\n4. Hedge funds have been loading up on it.\nFire season is over and they handled it perfectly, beyond that in they have an agreement with the state now where they will not be solely responsible for any fires.\n\n5. The inevitability of dividend reinstatement and the free reign they have to bring it back. In the bankruptcy agreement they agreed to not reinstate a dividend until 6 billion in non-GAAP earnings. What the fuck is non-GAAP? That means non generally accepted accounting principles. So they could literally make up any reason at any time, as to how they earned 6 billion dollars. \u201cHey guys, every dollar we earned and got a loan for is earnings even though we didnt account for ITDA.\u201d Nerds;\u201dHey PGE thats not generally accepted\u201d PGE; \u201cExactly you retards, why would you let us do this\u201d. They are on track to reinstate them based off of their average annual non-GAAP earnings in 2021 but you never know.\n\nThe last point should be the most bullish case for PCG. Dividend reinstatement is inevitable and when it happens every single boomer retirement and pension fund is going to race into this shit. Before the first fire case it had a share price of $70. Once the dividend is back this shit will have a tesla level bull run.\n\nSo dont be a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b and fucking pump this shit up because if we can get some meme-mentum behind this it will be insane.\n\nBuy mostly LEAPS, yolo some shit on weeklys if you\u2019re really a gambler?
