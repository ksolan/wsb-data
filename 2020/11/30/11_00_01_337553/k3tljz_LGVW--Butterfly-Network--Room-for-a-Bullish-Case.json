{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Ok gents, lil has been written about the LGVW-Butterfly deal. Between nurses/docs super excited about the product and the \u201ct\u2019s goooooing to moooon\u201d hype, I thought to **write a sound DD based on available facts** as I did for [Microvast](https://new.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k2rs84/thcb_microvast_inc_legit_analysis/) and [AvePoint](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k1y84a/apxt_avepoint_tendies_coming_up/). You may be sick of hearing about SPACs in 2020, but do keep an open mind about em bc solid companies are entering the mkt as well. Let\u2019s dive in\n\n**30 secs elevator pitch**: on November 19, 2020, Longview (LGVW) entered into a definitive business combination agreement with Butterfly Network (thereafter \u201cThe Company\u201d), valuing the latter at an Enterprise Value of $1.5Bn, after a Letter of Intent signed in Oct20. The proposed business combination is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2021, with the combined company\u2019s Class A common stock trading on the NYSE under the ticker BFLY. The Company makes ultrasound proprietary technology more universally accessible and affordable and it\u2019s backed by The Bill & Melinda Gates foundation\n\n**Investment Case Intro**: Butterfly attacks a large, $8 billion addressable market and expands it materially by meaningfully growing each of the following: points of care, geographic reach and use cases. Moreover, Butterfly has many attractive investment attributes: strong balance sheet and liquidity, low manufacturing costs, rapid growth, high recurring revenue, a discounted relative valuation and high-return reinvestment ops\n\n**// What the heck is Butterfly Network and why should I care?**\n\nButterfly Network is an innovative digital health company that is working to enable universal access to superior medical imaging. Key takeaway:\n\n* **In short**: founded by Dr. Jonathan Rothberg (winner of Presidential Medal of Tech & Innovation) in 2011 and led by CEO Laurent Faracci, Butterfly has created the world\u2019s first handheld, single-probe whole-body ultrasound system, Butterfly iQ, to make ultrasound technology more universally accessible and affordable\n\n[Company Footprint](https://preview.redd.it/zlfup4o7vc261.png?width=1992&format=png&auto=webp&s=14d30e42a093d5944291e87b08735b5111d337af)\n\n* **Addressing an unmet need**: Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) represents the biggest paradigm shift since x-ray. Historically, the global ultrasound market has been dominated by traditional cart-based devices that are accessible only to highly specialized technicians and are located predominantly in hospitals, imaging centres, and physicians\u2019 offices. POCUS usage today has been constrained by high upfront system cost, limited access, and suboptimal convenience. Notably 2/3 of the world has no access to medical imaging and 2/3 of diagnostic dilemmas can be addressed through simple imaging. The addressable market is represented by $6Bn of equipment market and $2Bn of service market, with an addressable population of 40M+ Global Healthcare Practitioners. Ultrasound uses sound waves instead of radiation and it\u2019s pushed by several macrotrends: (i) aging population, (ii) chronic disease proliferation, (iii) move from hospital to home settings and (iv) wellness monitoring\n\n[Product Roadmap](https://preview.redd.it/7e92hn7cvc261.png?width=2038&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6769be69850c489f9a414a74164e34993b8c88b)\n\n* **What about R&D?** While smartphone-based ultrasound devices have existed for years, Butterfly is the first to completely re-engineer the technology behind acquiring images. The goal? Increase quality and efficiency while decreasing costs. To accomplish this, Butterfly engineers had to figure out how to replace the very core element of the ultrasound probe \u2013 the piezoelectric crystals. Using sophisticated physics and fancy math, these piezoelectric crystals are used to \u2018transduce\u2019 sound energy into electrical energy and vice versa. Butterfly\u2019s new smartphone-based ultrasound device replaces expensive transducer crystals with computer chip technology, resulting in a device that costs less than $2,000, while currently emergency departments spend $25,000 to $250,000 to purchase and maintain sophisticated and cumbersome \u2018portable\u2019 ultrasound machines\n* **Relative analysis**: there are arguably three other major competitors to Butterfly iQ in the handheld ultrasound market: GE Vscan Extend, Philips Lumify, and the Clarius Wireless Scanner. Each of these devices are FDA approved for most of the major uses of POC (Point- of-Care) ultrasound. No other device on the market has a 3-in-1 transducer, which leads to doubling and tripling of cost for each additional probe. Additionally, only the Philips Lumify and Clarius are smartphone based. From a cost perspective, there is no comparison. Butterfly iQ drastically reduces the upfront cost, and there is no extra charge for their cloud computing and storage. Not to mention, the iQ is the only probe pushing the limits of AI and deep learning. In case you like CNBC, they listed Butterfly as one of the 50 [2020 disruptors companies](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/meet-the-2020-cnbc-disruptor-50-%20companies.html)\n\n*Comment of a Reseller, take it or leave it: \u201cI literally sell ultrasound for living. Butterfly is going to have a subscription service and this is seriously in high demand. 25% of my leads are currently asking for this tech. My starting price of Phillips is between 4.5-5k, Chinese brands start at 2500\u201d*\n\n[Competitors' Positioning](https://preview.redd.it/gn3zv6ojvc261.png?width=2010&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e62b92bedbc28af57b74b37b3d078b78f23ca08)\n\n* **Expected & Current Financials**: Butterfly has Substantial Growth Potential Across Multiple End-Markets with 65% revenue CAGR from 2019-2024E. Currently the company holds $500 million of cash to drive it through its investment phase and to expected positive cash flow. Significant discount to comparables, with 10.6x 2022E revenues with 70+% growth versus comparables at 13-20x+ 2022E revenues, with meaningfully slower growth. Total investment of over $400 million with first product introduced in 2018, 700+ patents and 2020E revenue of $44 million, projected to grow to $138 million in 2022E\n\n[Robust Roadmap](https://preview.redd.it/3jpqctmmvc261.png?width=2850&format=png&auto=webp&s=6342a8fd733a36214521579a020d61a02023b299)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Competitors' Valuation](https://preview.redd.it/ki45bwdpvc261.png?width=2670&format=png&auto=webp&s=a630eaba3ea21bef1adeb7e09efe3127dc957753)\n\n* **Who\u2019s managing my tendies?** Founder Dr. Jonathan Rothberg to become Chairman of the combined company and will be Butterfly\u2019s largest controlling shareholder. 100% of the equity of existing Butterfly Network investors, including Baillie Gifford, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Fosun Industrial Co., Limited, will convert into shares of the combined company.

Between nurses/docs super excited about the product and the \u201ct\u2019s goooooing to moooon\u201d hype, I thought to <strong>write a sound DD based on available facts</strong> as I did for <a href=\"https://new.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k2rs84/thcb_microvast_inc_legit_analysis/\">Microvast</a> and <a href=\"https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k1y84a/apxt_avepoint_tendies_coming_up/\">AvePoint</a>. You may be sick of hearing about SPACs in 2020, but do keep an open mind about em bc solid companies are entering the mkt as well. Let\u2019s dive in</p>\n\n<p><strong>30 secs elevator pitch</strong>: on November 19, 2020, Longview (LGVW) entered into a definitive business combination agreement with Butterfly Network (thereafter \u201cThe Company\u201d), valuing the latter at an Enterprise Value of $1.5Bn, after a Letter of Intent signed in Oct20. The proposed business combination is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2021, with the combined company\u2019s Class A common stock trading on the NYSE under the ticker BFLY. The Company makes ultrasound proprietary technology more universally accessible and affordable and it\u2019s backed by The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates foundation</p>\n\n<p><strong>Investment Case Intro</strong>: Butterfly attacks a large, $8 billion addressable market and expands it materially by meaningfully growing each of the following: points of care, geographic reach and use cases. Moreover, Butterfly has many attractive investment attributes: strong balance sheet and liquidity, low manufacturing costs, rapid growth, high recurring revenue, a discounted relative valuation and high-return reinvestment ops</p>\n\n<p><strong>// What the heck is Butterfly Network and why should I care?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Butterfly Network is an innovative digital health company that is working to enable universal access to superior medical imaging. Key takeaway:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>In short</strong>: founded by Dr. Jonathan Rothberg (winner of Presidential Medal of Tech &amp; Innovation) in 2011 and led by CEO Laurent Faracci, Butterfly has created the world\u2019s first handheld, single-probe whole-body ultrasound system, Butterfly iQ, to make ultrasound technology more universally accessible and affordable</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zlfup4o7vc261.png?width=1992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14d30e42a093d5944291e87b08735b5111d337af\">Company Footprint</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Addressing an unmet need</strong>: Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) represents the biggest paradigm shift since x-ray. Historically, the global ultrasound market has been dominated by traditional cart-based devices that are accessible only to highly specialized technicians and are located predominantly in hospitals, imaging centres, and physicians\u2019 offices. POCUS usage today has been constrained by high upfront system cost, limited access, and suboptimal convenience. Notably 2/3 of the world has no access to medical imaging and 2/3 of diagnostic dilemmas can be addressed through simple imaging. The addressable market is represented by $6Bn of equipment market and $2Bn of service market, with an addressable population of 40M+ Global Healthcare Practitioners. Ultrasound uses sound waves instead of radiation and it\u2019s pushed by several macrotrends: (i) aging population, (ii) chronic disease proliferation, (iii) move from hospital to home settings and (iv) wellness monitoring</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7e92hn7cvc261.png?width=2038&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6769be69850c489f9a414a74164e34993b8c88b\">Product Roadmap</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What about R&amp;D?</strong> While smartphone-based ultrasound devices have existed for years, Butterfly is the first to completely re-engineer the technology behind acquiring images. The goal? Increase quality and efficiency while decreasing costs. To accomplish this, Butterfly engineers had to figure out how to replace the very core element of the ultrasound probe \u2013 the piezoelectric crystals. Using sophisticated physics and fancy math, these piezoelectric crystals are used to \u2018transduce\u2019 sound energy into electrical energy and vice versa. Butterfly\u2019s new smartphone-based ultrasound device replaces expensive transducer crystals with computer chip technology, resulting in a device that costs less than $2,000, while currently emergency departments spend $25,000 to $250,000 to purchase and maintain sophisticated and cumbersome \u2018portable\u2019 ultrasound machines</li>\n<li><strong>Relative analysis</strong>: there are arguably three other major competitors to Butterfly iQ in the handheld ultrasound market: GE Vscan Extend, Philips Lumify, and the Clarius Wireless Scanner. Each of these devices are FDA approved for most of the major uses of POC (Point- of-Care) ultrasound. No other device on the market has a 3-in-1 transducer, which leads to doubling and tripling of cost for each additional probe. Additionally, only the Philips Lumify and Clarius are smartphone based. From a cost perspective, there is no comparison. Butterfly iQ drastically reduces the upfront cost, and there is no extra charge for their cloud computing and storage. Not to mention, the iQ is the only probe pushing the limits of AI and deep learning. In case you like CNBC, they listed Butterfly as one of the 50 <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/meet-the-2020-cnbc-disruptor-50-%20companies.html\">2020 disruptors companies</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Comment of a Reseller, take it or leave it: \u201cI literally sell ultrasound for living. Butterfly is going to have a subscription service and this is seriously in high demand. 25% of my leads are currently asking for this tech. My starting price of Phillips is between 4.5-5k, Chinese brands start at 2500\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gn3zv6ojvc261.png?width=2010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e62b92bedbc28af57b74b37b3d078b78f23ca08\">Competitors&#39; Positioning</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Expected &amp; Current Financials</strong>: Butterfly has Substantial Growth Potential Across Multiple End-Markets with 65% revenue CAGR from 2019-2024E. Currently the company holds $500 million of cash to drive it through its investment phase and to expected positive cash flow. Significant discount to comparables, with 10.6x 2022E revenues with 70+% growth versus comparables at 13-20x+ 2022E revenues, with meaningfully slower growth. Total investment of over $400 million with first product introduced in 2018, 700+ patents and 2020E revenue of $44 million, projected to grow to $138 million in 2022E</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3jpqctmmvc261.png?width=2850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6342a8fd733a36214521579a020d61a02023b299\">Robust Roadmap</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ki45bwdpvc261.png?width=2670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a630eaba3ea21bef1adeb7e09efe3127dc957753\">Competitors&#39; Valuation</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Who\u2019s managing my tendies?</strong> Founder Dr. Jonathan Rothberg to become Chairman of the combined company and will be Butterfly\u2019s largest controlling shareholder. 100% of the equity of existing Butterfly Network investors, including Baillie Gifford, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Fosun Industrial Co., Limited, will convert into shares of the combined company.
