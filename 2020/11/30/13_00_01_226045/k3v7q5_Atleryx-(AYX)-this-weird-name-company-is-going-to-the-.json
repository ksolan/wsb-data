{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "supp guys, hope you are ready for another busy week of loss porn and short selling reports that gonna destroy your accounts. \n\nFor all those of you who missed the pltr and gme train or are too scared to get in (if you are than gtfo of this subreddit), I'm going to show you a company that is so undervalued it hurts and its to take off soon\ud83d\ude80\n\n**So what is Alteryx?**\n\nglad you asked, Alteryx is a data analytics data science company that provides a platform for companies to perform analysis of the data, share it, and deploy lots of analytic models. The platform can be used by business analysts, programmers, and trained data scientists. The company wants to solve the problem of wasting time in the organization for doing simple Data analytics. As for 2020 60 BILLION DOLLARS per year wasted on analysts doing repetitive manual work in spreadsheets. The uniqueness of this company is that the interface of the platform is very intuitive and user friendly, using drag and drop interface and mainly reduces the need to write complex software code. Their platform is designed to interact with almost any data source, starting from IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP to AWS, Google Analytics, Workday, and more.\n\n**Who are the customers?**\n\nSo the company has, as of 2020, approx. 7000 customers in more than 90 countries and big names like Netflix, Salesforce, Toyota, Chevron, Uber, Twitter, Xerox, Nasdaq, and many more. The company already has a name in the big boys' playground and we can expect it to continue to expand. \n\n**Tell me more, please.**\n\nNo problem amigo. The company continues its growth strategy by a series of acquisitions mainly for developing tools and talented people. in 2019 they acquired ClearStory Data mainly because the developers are very good and can leverage them to help to develop and improve their tools. They acquired Feature Labs to augment their machine learning capabilities and to penetrate to the East coast of the US. Also the company announced strategic alliances with Adobe, UiPath and ABBYY to accelerate adoption of APA (analytic process automation) which altreyx is a leader at. \n\nAlteryx is a subscription-based software which makes it a SaaS company the same as TTD, Shopify and so on, but it focuses on analytics. Their main competitors are the big software companies (IBM, Microsoft, SAP) and some small ones which most of them are private.                  So in order to compare them to check if they are under/overvalued, I will use companies in the same field as Datadog, Splunk, and more.\n\n**Let's dig in for some numbers**\n\nAnnual revenue has increased from 86M to 418M in just 4 years (2016-2019) that is a 48% CAGR which is amazing. This year the company expects to grow revenues at around 15% mainly because of covid, which made companies cut expenses.\n\nQ3 revenues growth is 38% YOY, customer growth is 24% YOY.                                                        Gross Margin is 93% (Amazing) Operating Margin is 24%. This company is super efficient and with great margins.\n\nThe company is profitable as of the 3Q with a positive EPS of 0.07. It uses more than 50% of its gross profit for R&D which is exactly what we want to see in a growing tech company.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nCash is down to 95M from 409M mainly because of acquisitions, but short term investments are almost double YOY with 627M. **Current Ration** is 1:4 approx. and **asset to liabilities ratio** is 1:1.5 so the company is indeed solvent and can survive even black swans like covid.                 Liabilities wise the company has 650M in convertible bonds which as we see can be covered by the short-term investments, It is something we should consider when the company starts to underperform, not now though. \n\nCash from Operating Activities for the 3Q is 16.3 M an improvement of 20%                              FCF is negative for the quarter mainly because of the investments they made (240M) \n\nSo the company is performing really well so far this year and is able to grow despite covid and companies reducing expenses. Of course, they need to increase their FCF but as long as they are growing and acquiring companies it's all good.\n\n**Let's use some gay TA to see what's going on**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AYX 1 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/eu91ywiifd261.jpg?width=1374&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96335b788ca104400101c7f29fdc13435ce4aac7)\n\nWell as you see AYX is in a range for quite a while (since May) with 104 and 80 acting as support and 150 and 178 as resistance. It hits 104 twice and couldn't break it and in the last 2 weeks, it tried again, and again was denied. \n\nSo the stock can now go to 150 easily or contest again the 104 level. with the tech trend going up I can see it going to retest that 150 level hoping to break it.\n\n**Now we compare this company with other companies**\n\n \n\n* SNOW: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~100x\n* DDOG: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 40x\n* MongoDB: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 25x\n* **Alteryx: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 15x**\n* JFROG: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 30x \n* PLTR \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 50x\n\n(thanks  [u/xwpv8j62](https://new.reddit.com/user/xwpv8j62/) for the info)\n\nAs you see AYX is the most UNDERVALUED company here which means a lot of room to grow.\n\nGross Margin:\n\n**AYX- 92%**\n\nDDOG- 78%\n\nSNOW - 55%\n\nMongoDB- 69%\n\nP/S Ratio:\n\n**AYX-  16.95**\n\nDDOG- 51.71\n\nSNOW - 150.15\n\nMONGODB-  30.88\n\nPLTR - 47.76\n\nAYX has the best margin, best ratios, and still is way undervalued than its peers.
