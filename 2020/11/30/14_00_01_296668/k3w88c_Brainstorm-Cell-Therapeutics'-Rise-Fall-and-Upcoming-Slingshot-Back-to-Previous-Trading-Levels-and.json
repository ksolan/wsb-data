{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics ($BC LI) is a leader in ALS treatment development, as well as developing treatments for MS and other diseases, some of which are in advanced FDA study phases. Brainstorm\u2019s NurOwn is their self-developed product and treatment procedure used to treat ALS.\n\nI came about this company through my following of neurodegenerative treatment news (not stock/business news), as a specific disease in this realm runs in my family and have since been following them for a while. Long DD post ahead, see TLDR and positions at the bottom if not interested.\n\n**TLDR:** This company has developed a product and treatment for ALS that appears to be more effective than any other treatment currently available and will likely obtain FDA approval very soon. The stock dropped recently, but there are three upcoming events, a professional conference, a Congressional Bill, and FDA approval, that I believe will return the stock to its previous trading level, yielding a x2.5 gain, and beyond. I have calls to capture the immediate gain of the stock returning to normal levels, and shares to capture the long-term gain over time.\n\n**WSB TLDR:** The rocket ship is on the launch pad, being loaded with fuel and freeze dried astronaut food tendies, rocket gonna yeet to Uranus and beyond and we gonna fuk and clap alien cheeks \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83e\ude90 \ud83e\ude90 \ud83e\ude90\ud83d\udc7d \ud83d\udc7d \ud83d\udc7d \ud83c\udf46 \ud83c\udf46 \ud83c\udf46 \ud83d\udca6 \ud83d\udca6 \ud83d\udca6\n\n**What happened to their stock that caused it to drop from 11.94 to 4.00 earlier this month?**\n\nBrainstorm\u2019s NurOwn was in phase 3 of FDA trials. The stock tumbled on news from its ALS study.\n\n**What was the bad news from the study?**\n\nThe treatment worked in the study, no ifs, ands, or buts. The efficacy response rate (laymen = effectiveness) goal was 35%, and 34.7% was achieved. The reason the news was considered \u2018bad\u2019 is the placebo group had an unusually high response rate:\n\n\\>The Phase 3 clinical trial's primary efficacy endpoint, a responder analysis evaluating the proportion of participants who experienced a 1.25 points per month improvement in the post-treatment Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) slope, was powered on assumed treatment response rates of 35% on NurOwn versus 15% on Placebo. These estimates were based on available historical clinical trial data and the NurOwn Phase 2 data. The primary endpoint was achieved in 34.7% of NurOwn participants versus 27.7% for Placebo (p=0.453). Therefore, the trial met the expected 35% NurOwn treatment group efficacy response assumption, however the high placebo response exceeded placebo responses observed in contemporary ALS trials. \\[[Source](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Brainstorm+Cell+Therapeutics+%28BCLI%29+NurOwn+Phase+3+ALS+Study+Did+Not+Reach+Statistically+Significant+Results/17611652.html)\\]\n\nA possible explanation for this is that the study was conducted on patients with severe ALS, and the study was only 7 months long, as opposed to a more traditional18 month study. A longer study would have likely seen a larger spread between the treatment and placebo. A presentation being given on December 9th (detailed below) will likely explain the choice to do a shorter study.\n\n**Patients in the study saw positive results:**\n\nThe efficacy shows positive results. Some had the progression of their disease stopped entirely. Stopping and reversal are best case scenarios, it is unlikely ALS will be \u2018curable\u2019 anytime soon, until a major breakthrough method of treatment is discovered.\n\n[Yahoo news article](https://www.yahoo.com/news/congress-help-36-old-als-101139537.html) citing a patient who said he saw a complete stop in the progression of ALS during the NurOwn study, and unfortunately has seen motors skills functions drop after being taken off when the study ended \\[[Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/congress-help-36-old-als-101139537.html)\\]\n\n*>Earlier this year he was lucky enough to partake in the stage 3 trial for the drug NurOwn, and found success. During the several months that he was on the drug, his disease didn\u2019t get any worse.*\n\n*>Yet it\u2019s taken NurOwn 10 years to develop to this point, and it\u2019s still not available on the market. Even Henson can no longer access it now that the trial is over and he said he\u2019s already seen his motor functions begin to drop.*\n\n**The next three potential upward events for the stock:**\n\n**1: Presentation of study results at an upcoming ALS conference.**\n\nDoctors from Brainstorm will be presenting at the 31st International Symposium on ALS/MND on December 9th, where they will discuss the clinical trial results of the study. \\[[Source](https://ir.brainstorm-cell.com/2020-11-23-BrainStorm-to-present-NurOwn-R-Phase-3-Clinical-Trial-Results-at-31st-International-Symposium-on-ALS-MND)\\]. In theory, if they have a potential explanation for the higher than expected placebo, combined with the known positive results, this may move the stock upwards.\n\n**2: Congress has a strongly supported, bipartisan bill being pushed that will benefit ALS research and treatment approval as a whole, and therefore Brainstorm as a company.**\n\nHR 8662, \u2018Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act\u2019 is a bill in Congress which has bipartisan support that benefits patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, by speeding up the approval process for treatments. Furthermore, it funds money to help patients who receive treatment from incurring any/as much out of pocket expenses. \\[[Source](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/8662/text?r=2&s=1)\\]\n\n**3: FDA approval is very likely for NurOwn.**\n\nRadicava and Riduzole are currently two treatments with FDA approval for ALS, and NurOwn has a higher efficacy rate. Brainstorm is already in discussions with the FDA to seek approval. No information available shows the treatment having a negative or damaging effect on any patients. More information will likely be shared at the December 9th conference. Since ALS can\u2019t be cured with our current knowledge of the disease and treatments available, the threshold for FDA approval is lower.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nDue to the potential for the stock to produce a 150% return if the price returns to trading levels just a month ago, I have bought both shares and calls instead of just calls.\n\nShares: 732\n\nOptions, as of close 11/27: [https://ibb.co/dDV0bLH](https://ibb.co/dDV0bLH)  \n10 x 12/18 6.00 C +52%   \n37 x 12/18 5.00 C +36%   \n20 x 1/15/21 7.00 C +22.86%   \n7 x 1/21/22 5.00 C +27.74%\n\nThe gains on the first three calls are just from 3 hours of trading, purchased on Friday. The 1/21/22 call I've had for two weeks, but I diluted my gains when I bought more of the same call last week. Will print big time space bucks even if the stock moves up just a dollar, but I fully believe the stock will return to its trading levels from earlier this month, and will blast off into orbit with good news from any of their current treatments in development, whether it be study results, FDA approval, Congress passing bills that benefit the company directly, etc.", "author_fullname": "t2_3j87rgu6", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics' Rise, Fall, and Upcoming Slingshot Back to Previous Trading Levels and Into Orbit", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_k3w88c", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1606773483.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics ($BC LI) is a leader in ALS treatment development, as well as developing treatments for MS and other diseases, some of which are in advanced FDA study phases.
