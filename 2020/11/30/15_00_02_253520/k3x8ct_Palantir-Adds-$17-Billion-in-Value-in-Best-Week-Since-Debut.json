An analysis of open interest shows most of the contracts being opened and closed in the same day, indicating a heavy presence of day traders.\n\nAfter an initial lackluster performance following its direct-listing stock debut, gains for the Denver-based firm, which sells data-analysis tools, have accelerated after hedge funds, including Steve Cohen\u2019s Point72 Asset Management, reported purchasing the company\u2019s shares.\n\n\u201cBig-data companies have become very important and historically have been excellent stocks.

Now, the stock has gained nearly 300% since its direct listing. It reported third-quarter losses in its first financial results since going public as compensation costs surged.
