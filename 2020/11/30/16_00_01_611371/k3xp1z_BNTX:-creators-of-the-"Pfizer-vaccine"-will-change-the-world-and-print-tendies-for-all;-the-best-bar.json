{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "There have been a couple of (excellent) recent posts here about why Novavax (NVAX) is a good play with their vaccine in trials that are likely to succeed. But much like Jim Cramer and the rest on the day the \"Pfizer vaccine\" trial results were announced, everyone is looking for related plays and overlooking the company that created the first vaccine, started it all, and is going to change the world.\n\n**Who is BioNTech, and what do they have to do with the Pfizer vaccine?**\n\nBioNTech (BNTX) created the \"Pfizer vaccine.\" Pfizer (PFE) is their partner for clinical trials and distribution (except Fosun Pharma is handling those duties in mainland China); BNTX is a direct peer and competitor to the better-known Moderna. A German company started by a married couple of Turkish immigrants, BNTX, like MRNA, has been working for years on messenger RNA-based therapeutics, especially for cancer, but it turns out messenger RNA (mRNA) is also an ideal technology for producing quick, effective, safe vaccines.\n\nMuch like PFE, BNTX tends to be quite conservative in their forward-looking public statements. This includes their initial announcement that their vaccine was \"at least 90% effective,\" which turned out to be 95% effective. MRNA also does great work, but their CEO tends to be more of a \"salesman\" - which isn't all bad, but tends to get their gains priced in earlier than BNTX.\n\n**The vaccine is not the biggest thing here though. BNTX is going to change the world.**\n\nVaccine revenue will be a big deal for BNTX (and for MRNA), and probably justifies share prices in the $140-$150 range, especially if annual boosters are needed for the vaccine (the jury is still out on that).\n\nBut the real upside in BNTX is that this vaccine - their first product coming to market - validates their entire technology platform based on messenger RNA (mRNA). Messenger RNA has been a bit of a \"holy grail\" in medicine for decades, but there were significant difficulties in turning it into a practical tool. It's fragile, and tended to induce the wrong kinds of immune reactions, from what I have read (I am not a doctor).\n\nBut BNTX and MRNA have cracked that code, using lipid nanocapsules to deliver the mRNA to cells, where it instructs the cells to create desired proteins; in the case of this vaccine, antibodies against the Coronavirus spike protein.\n\n**But mRNA can be programmed - quickly, easily, and inexpensively - to instruct cells to create** ***any*** **proteins.**\n\nImagine a future where you receive a cancer diagnosis and your doctor takes a quick blood draw or biopsy, sends the results to a lab, and a week later you go back in for a shot that instructs your body how to destroy the tumor based on the specific genetic/chemical structure of your individual tumor. A future where programmable vaccines are created in days against new infectious diseases. A future where the body can create any proteins needed to cure a huge array of diseases and disorders.\n\nIs this realistic?\n\nConsider this: the Human Genome Project - a massive scientific success - took 13 years and $2.7 billion to sequence a single human genome. Now a human genome can be sequenced for something like $150 retail and takes a few days.\n\nmRNA is going to be like that. Cheap, quick, custom therapies for many diseases that cause significant morbidity and mortality today.\n\nAnd BioNTech and Moderna are leading the way (but BioNTech is currently the better buy).\n\n**Recent price movements and comparison with peers and competitors:**\n\nFirst, the more technical side. For most of the past month (since the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine results were announced), BioNTech has traded a bit above Moderna and Novavax in terms of per-share price (their pricing overall has been remarkably similar); BioNTech has tended to command a $5 to $10 premium over the two peers, with a brief larger premium in the week or so after the announcement.\n\nBut here's the thing: Moderna and Novavax took \\~$25 per share gains Friday on the news of the AstraZeneca trial errors, while BioNTech only gained about $5 on the news, leaving Moderna and Novavax $15-$17 *above* BioNTech. That trend has only continued this morning, with Moderna now up to a $30 per share premium over BioNTech.\n\nThere is no real-world reason for this new premium. The AstraZeneca difficulties will benefit BNTX just as much as they benefit MRNA and NVAX. So why did it happen? Probably because BNTX is a German company and people think of their vaccine as the \"Pfizer vaccine.\"\n\nIn addition, Barron's published a [story](https://www.barrons.com/articles/modernas-final-covid-vaccine-results-are-imminent-billions-in-revenue-will-follow-goldman-says-51606326525) about GS noting that MRNA will go from zero sales to billions of dollars next year and raised their price target from $107 to $139. All of this is true, and is now partially priced in. But all of it is also true of BNTX - but nobody has noticed yet; it's nowhere near priced in.\n\nThe Motley Fool guys are much the same - they published a [story](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/29/3-key-advantages-moderna-holds-pfizer-and-astra-z/) about MRNA's advantages over AZN and PFE - which made valid points - but completely ignored BNTX, when in fact *every* point they made in MRNA's favor applies even more to BNTX. They argue that MRNA being small is an advantage (because the vaccine results will affect their financials disproportionately), which is true. And they note that MRNA doesn't have to share revenue, unlike PFE and AZN - also true. And BNTX does have to share revenue with PFE (I've read elsewhere 50/50), but BNTX market cap is less than half of MRNA's, which ought to put them on level ground.\n\n**Target price?**\n\nI believe BNTX can go to $160 in the near term, meaning within the next two weeks (it's at $119.97 currently). Long term? I don't know; how much money can be made changing the face of medicine, especially cancer? PFE's market cap is $207B; AZN's is $138B. JNJ is $379B. I think it's entirely plausible that BNTX joins their ranks over the next few years; current BNTX market cap is $26.5B. So maybe a 10-bagger on just shares over the next few years?\n\n**Is there a catalyst?**\n\nYes - in fact, there are two.\n\nFirst, the FDA has a meeting on 12/10 to consider BNTX's application for an Emergency Use Authorization. This is thought to be nearly automatic; I cannot see a scenario where this is not granted quickly. There seems to be some sentiment that approval may even come that very day, which would make the 12/11 calls very attractive \\*if\\* it happens.\n\nSecond, PFE and BNTX are due to publish their actual trial data in a peer-reviewed journal very soon. Quite a few people seem to be taking something of a \"wait and see\" attitude toward the vaccine, saying they don't trust \"press release data.\" This is not unreasonable. I see this as a strong upside though, because PFE and BNTX recent history is that they are \\*very\\* conservative with their public statements. The actual underlying data, when published, is likely to be even more favorable than their public statements. This is in contrast to MRNA, which tends to put the best face on their data (though their data is likely also very positive), and especially in contract to AZN, which put their spin machine in high gear with their recent results (and error) news.\n\n**What's the play?**\n\nShares ought to return 25-35% just this month, and perhaps 100% annually over the next few years. If you want to try calls, a high-risk, high-reward play would be something like 135c 12/11; lower risk but still rewarding could be 125c 12/31.\n\n**What about NVAX, MRNA, PFE, and AZN?**\n\nNovavax and Moderna probably still have some upside. Novavax is still a month or two away from their Phase 3 results, which are likely (but not certain) to be positive (they have had successes and failures in their past). But NVAX stock is currently $15 above BNTX after trailing BNTX for weeks; I think their upside is currently more priced-in than BNTX (probably, again, because \"Pfizer vaccine\").\n\nModerna (MRNA), like BNTX, is going to be part of changing the world, and should be a solid investment. But their current market cap is double that of BNTX, and their stock has appreciated more recently (also $30 above BNTX despite consistently trailing BNTX until Friday). MRNA's boost is mostly priced in now. Both these stocks got boosts as \"non-AZN vaccine stocks\" on Friday because of AZN's difficulties; BNTX was simply overlooked.\n\nPfizer is a good company with good leadership, in my opinion. But it's a huge company; vaccine profits are unlikely to be material. It will move up and down, slow and boring, and pay dividends. If you want to buy PFE you should be at r/investing instead.\n\nAZN is another giant company; their errors won't be material because they're selling the vaccine at cost anyway. But in my opinion they mishandled their communications regarding the error; I see them as another r/investing discussion, and a worse one than PFE.\n\nAll great companies, but at the moment BNTX is a bargain.\n\n**What about the cold storage thing?**\n\nYes, the Pfizer/BioNTech requires colder storage than the other options. This is a challenge, but not as big a deal as it's being portrayed by some: the vaccine ships in reusable containers packed with dry ice that can keep the vaccine at the needed temperatures for 10 days without being in a freezer, and the dry ice can be refilled to last longer than that. And it can be pulled from that container and placed in a refrigerator for an additional 5 days. Yes, cold chain logistics will require some attention, but it's not a deal breaker.\n\n**OK, but how do you know any of this?**\n\nI'm not a medical professional, but I have had a lot of free time this year because my main gig  is shut down for Covid. So I have been following Covid news since mid-January (my other business's supply chain was being disrupted), and vaccine development since the beginning. I predicted early on that vaccines would be more effective than predictions were saying (90% or more vs 50-70%), I predicted that BNTX would be first past the gate, and I figured out that they were underplaying their own trial (they \"hid\" data from themselves for a couple of weeks to avoid an early announcement in order to let the trial run, since they had to wait for safety data for FDA anyway). I purchased 2,000 shares of BNTX about two weeks before the trial announcement and made some good gains. Unfortunately I'm a novice investor; this was my first big play, and I figured out options on RH right at closing time on the Friday afternoon before the big Monday morning announcement, so I was too late by about an hour to get in on even bigger gains.\n\nI sold some shares near an early peak and bought/sold here and there since then; I currently hold 2,500 shares of BNTX shares, plus 115c 12/11 and 125c 12/31. I also hold MRNA, NVAX, \\[banned SPAC ticker\\], PSTH, and TMO in various amounts.\n\n**TL;DR:** BioNTech created the Pfizer vaccine and owns 50% of the gross profits; much like Moderna, the vaccine is their first product to market and validates a technology platform (mRNA) that will change the world of medicine, but unlike Moderna, it's being overlooked a bit and presents a serious opportunity, both short term and long term. Their CEO and Chief Medical Officer are sleeping with each other, but they're married (yes, to each other), so it's fine. I should have posted this in October when I first bought in but I hadn't discovered this subreddit yet so I didn't and I'm sorry about that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bmvtixkg9e261.png?width=1145&format=png&auto=webp&s=19262ea08d35aecd8498d2b5592bb0c091d28cab", "author_fullname": "t2_2191ir6t", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "BNTX: creators of the \"Pfizer vaccine\" will change the world and print tendies for all; the best bargain of vaccine stocks right now", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "media_metadata": {"bmvtixkg9e261": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bmvtixkg9e261.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6febc56e50bce3e9212c6c07aa39d8275b979dd5"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bmvtixkg9e261.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b87681ab37332c6d5010bbf34c69e03d869dd514"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bmvtixkg9e261.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c04e0ae01e29412b89c7ad8fe704b20de5fcf6c9"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bmvtixkg9e261.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=33ca3465640ecd2a3ec9c210442a5475510e180e"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bmvtixkg9e261.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a1f94423e33f925c28bb3a2ee8f7e00ee71b51d7"}, {"y": 608, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bmvtixkg9e261.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d6976b1af5b2dcc77a3f82fd496475762d727dc1"}], "s": {"y": 645, "x": 1145, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bmvtixkg9e261.png?width=1145&format=png&auto=webp&s=19262ea08d35aecd8498d2b5592bb0c091d28cab"}, "id": "bmvtixkg9e261"}}, "name": "t3_k3xp1z", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 77, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 77, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/mfI68DRV1pFA03eU8BdZpxThD5XHM6QXSDAaEcsXlMg.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1606778308.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>There have been a couple of (excellent) recent posts here about why Novavax (NVAX) is a good play with their vaccine in trials that are likely to succeed.
