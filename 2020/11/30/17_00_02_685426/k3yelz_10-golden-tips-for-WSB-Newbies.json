{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Reading through some of the posts I can see how a lot of newbies have FOMO (fear of missing out). Post after post of losers making huge returns. Everyone is getting rich but you. Boofuckinghoo. The smart investor realizes it\u2019s all hype. Some of it works, most of it doesn\u2019t. To be successful you need to be able to recognize the difference and to do that, you need time, knowledge and practice. \n\nHere are ten tips that can help you along the way. \n\n**Tip 1 - You don\u2019t know shit**\n\nYou\u2019re going to lose your money. Don\u2019t get suckered by reading posts about guys who made 1000% return in 5 minutes. For every one guy that posts his massive gains, 100+ suckers have lost their money. The first lesson to realize is that it\u2019s way easier to lose money in the market than to make money. \n\n**Tip 2 - Understand how money flows in the market**\n\nMoney moves from the idiots to the knowledgable, from the impatient to the patient. Any dummy can make money short term. But to make money long-term and truly grow a portfolio, you have to be armed with knowledge and a shit ton of patience. \n\n**Tip 3 - Play for the long term**\n\nThe most important rule you need to follow religiously is NEVER FUCKING LOSE MONEY. Print it big, tape it to your wall. Your top responsibility is protecting your capital. YOLO is a stupid play. 99% of you are going to bet at the wrong time with the wrong stock. Calm the fuck down and work on a long term strategy. You have decades dummy. \n\n**Tip 4 - Time is on your side, but not much else**\n\nThe market never stops. The machine just churns and churns. Rich to poor, poor to rich, it just keeps on turning and turning. There are ALWAYS opportunities. Another IPO. Another MEME turd. FOMO is for fools. Miss a run? Big fucking deal. There\u2019s another one around the corner. You have plenty of time to learn, test, and grow your capital. \n\n**Tip 5 - Paper Trading**\n\nPaper trading is a simulation. It behaves exactly like a real account with real active data but it\u2019s all practice. No real money exchanges. It\u2019s a great way to learn, to see how shitty you\u2019re going to do without losing a penny. DO THIS FOR TWO YEARS. Take whatever capital you have right now and buy some long term ETFs or solid ass stocks with minimal risk. Keep adding to it EVERY paycheck. Build up some capital for when you\u2019re ready to trade for real. Take two years to learn how to trade, watch your paper portfolio go to zero a couple dozen times, read and follow the news, WSB, Stocktwits, etc. Ask questions, test out your strategies. You\u2019ll thank me two years from now. \n\n**Tip 6 - Understand taxes**\n\nBig difference between short term and long term capital gains. Uncle Sam loves you short timers. Paying taxes is for suckers. \n\n**Tip 7 - No one knows shit**\n\nThere is no crystal ball, no one has the \u201cinside track\u201d, and only believe 10% of what you read. Be very fucking skeptical. About everything. Social media, analysts, CEOs, news, all if it, be fucking skeptical. It\u2019s all manipulation. Don\u2019t even trust Buffett. You are the guardian of your capital. Everyone wants to take it it away from you. Understand that and you won\u2019t get suckered so easily. \n\n**Tip 8 - Learn to read fundamentals and understand valuations**\n\nAs much as the market today feels like a casino, the underlying foundation of the market is investing, not gambling. With every stock you buy you\u2019re buying a piece of a business. Learn to read fundamentals. Do they make money? Are they growing? Do they have debt? How are their competitors valued? Do they make more money today than they did 5 years ago? How will they make more? How do they return capital to shareholders? And on and on and on. Learn motherfuckers. Earnings per share. P/E rations. Intrinsic value. Net income. Figure out formulas for valuing stocks. Is TSLA worth over 250x earnings? Is WFC undervalued at 13x earnings? Investing blindly because big\\_dick\\_loser said so in a post is beyond idiotic. Just burn your money, you\u2019ll have more fun. \n\n**Tip 9 - Get rich schemes are for suckers**\n\nRemove the bookmark for Ferrari. You ain\u2019t getting one anytime soon. Play fucking smart. Go long. Think in decades, not days. You\u2019re not smart enough to day trade and beat the system. Not long-term anyways. Most of you won\u2019t beat the market over 10 years. So be fucking smart. Paper trade until you can consistently prove gains month after month. When you\u2019re ready to trade for real, dip in slowly. Fuck FOMO. Fuck YOLO. Remember, time is on your side. Compound that shit. \n\n**Tip 10 - Discipline and dedication**\n\nLike anything in life, to be successful you have to fucking work at it. Easy money never lasts. Dig in, learn, practice, rinse and repeat. Be motivated to learn how to invest, take the time to study, read, test and constantly improve. Be disciplined with your money. It\u2019s fucking hard to make, easy to lose. Protect that shit. \n\n\\--\n\nFor those of you this resonates with, you\u2019ll be fine long term. Do the fucking work. For those of you who love chasing the fantasy, good luck, I mean it. It\u2019s a tough fucking pill to swallow watching your account get dwindled down to zero. Nothing tastes worse that losing all your money. \n\nPeace.", "author_fullname": "t2_24o2i153", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "10 golden tips for WSB Newbies", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Shitpost"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "shitpost", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_k3yelz", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 328, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": true, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Shitpost", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 328, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1606780419.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Reading through some of the posts I can see how a lot of newbies have FOMO (fear of missing out).
