{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Listen you retards. You\u2019ve been busy posting gain/loss porns all over this sub, but it\u2019s almost that time of the year when you have to file taxes for Uncle Sam. This is also important because some of you retards will want to file taxes super early, receive refunds early, and throw all that money into weekly FD\u2019s and other plays because ..... well ..... you are all sick bastards.\n\nAnyway, let\u2019s get the easy part out.\n\n**If You Lost Tendies**\n\nFor retards who have trouble figuring out whether you won or lost tendies this year. Take your RH app, locate the line chart that shows your account balance over time. Click \u201c1Y\u201d and then take your finger over to around Jan 2020 Account Balance and figure out your account balance around that time. Then take the same finger and place it over around Dec 2020. If your Jan 2020 balance is higher than your Dec 2020 balance, then you probably lost money.\n\nWait till RH issues your 1099 Tax Form before you do anything, **but single filers can expect to deduct up to $3k in capital tendies losses each year.**\n\n**If You Made Tendies**\n\nWell, if you made tendies this year, congratulations. This means that you took your autism to a greater height and made tendies that your mom will be proud of.\n\nWell, if you made tendies, things get complicated because Uncle Sam wants it to be complicated. Even though tendies are great, the taxes you pay are based on the time period you held the stock in your account. If you held your investment for a year or less (which is very likely for most of you retards in this sub), you pay a short-term capital gains rate, which is the same rate you would pay on the wages you earn from a working job.\n\n**Uncle Sam's Bracket for 2020**\n\n|Tax Rate|Single Filers|Married (Joint)|Head of Household|Married (Separate)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|10%|$0 to $9,875|$0 to $19,750|$0 to $14,100|$0 to $9,875|\n|12%|$9,876 to $40,125|$19,751 to $80,250|$14,101 to $53,700|$9,876 to $40,125|\n|22%|$40,126 to $85,525|$80,251 to $171,050|$53,701 to $85,500|$40,126 to $85,525|\n|24%|$85,526 to $163,300|$171,051 to $326,600|$85,501 to $163,300|$85,526 to $163,300|\n|32%|$163,301 to $207,350|$326,601 to $414,700|$163,301 to $207,350|$163,301 to $207,350|\n|35%|$207,351 to $518,400|$414,701 to $622,050|$207,351 to $518,400|$207,351 to $311,025|\n|37%|$518,401 or more|$622,051 or more|$518,401 or more|$311,026 or more|\n\nSo for retards who can't figure out the above table because you have never held a job in your life or you've been unemployed for too long, let's say your **taxable income** for 2020 (after all your deductions and exemptions) is $9,000 and you are filing single, then your tax is 10% of $9,000. Remember, **taxable income is after all the deductions and exemptions.** So even if you made tendies of $10k this year (and this is only income that you generated this year), you have to take standard deduction and other exemptions before you calculate your taxable income. Standard deduction for single filer for 2020 is $12,400 by itself. So in this case, you don't owe Uncle Sam shit if you made $10k in tendies. Confused? Who cares. Just say thank you.\n\n**Long Term Capital Tendies Tax**\n\nIn an unlikely event that you've held your investment for more than a year, Uncle Sam will reward you with a lower capital tendies tax of 0%, 15%, or 20% based on your taxable income. For 2020, you can completely ignore taxes on capital tendies if your taxable income is $40,000 or less (single filers) or $80,000 or less (married filers). \n\n**Other Considerations**\n\nIf you have unrealized loss on some bad investment, consider ridding yourself of such position before the end of the year to offset against some of your capital tendies gains. Remember, short term losses are offset against short term gains first, and long term losses are offset against long term gains. Net losses of either type can then be deducted against the other kind of gain.\n\nFor example,\n\n* If you have $4,000 of short-term loss and only $3,000 of short-term gain, the net $1,000 short-term loss can be deducted against your net long-term gain (assuming you have one).\n* If you have an overall net capital loss for the year, you can deduct up to $3,000 of that loss against other kinds of income, including your salary and interest income.\n* Any excess net capital loss can be carried over to subsequent years to be deducted against capital gains and against up to $3,000 of other kinds of income.", "author_fullname": "t2_3oskv4er", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "[Taxes] Capital Gains Tax Primer for All Degenerates", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Discussion"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_k46sy8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1606803663.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Listen you retards.
