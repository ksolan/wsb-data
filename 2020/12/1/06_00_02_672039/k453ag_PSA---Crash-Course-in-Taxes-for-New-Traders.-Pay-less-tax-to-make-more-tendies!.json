{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "You can\u2019t be a serious trader without really understanding tax strategies. I know it\u2019s some boring accountant BS, but it\u2019s one of the few things, other than $420 TSLA calls and shorting NKLA at $50, that is actually free money. This should make it more motivating if your head is in the right place - making money priority #1.\n\nGood tax decisions save you money in most cases with little or no change to your risk level. I regularly see people do stuff on this forum that is exposing them to huge tax liability. And, doing it wrong can cause you to actually zero out your account AND owe a ton of money next year.  So, here\u2019s a crash course on how to do this. The year is almost over, and you need to do this stuff NOW to be in good shape for your tax bill next year.  (NOTE - this is for US citizens and US residents. If you are elsewhere, other rules apply. Before you cackle at us Europeans, some of you have wealth taxes which are even worse). As for Singaporeans, your tax system is awesome, la.\n\nAnyway...\n\n**The basics:**\n\nTaxes are incurred in a few ways. First, whenever you SELL a security, you realize a gain or loss that is a taxable event. Secondly, when you hold 1256 contracts at year end you get marked to market (oil futures, NDX, SPX, etc). You usually wont have these. And lastly when you receive dividends, which no one on this sub ever has.\n\nOf course, you only get taxed on gains\u2026 offset by losses that you made in the past or the SAME YEAR. The big danger with a year like this is you have massive gains that you\u2019ve realized\u2026 which means you\u2019ll owe massive taxes. If you trade with that money and lose it next year, you\u2019ll not be able to mark those against your gains, and you could hypothetically zero out your account with a dumb trade next year, AND owe a ton of taxes. Also note that if you are at a net loss, you don\u2019t owe tax, and the residual losses carry forward to protect you from taxes on the same amount of some future gain. I believe you apply STCG to STCL first, but in the absence of that, you can use LTCL. Same for LTCG vs LTCL, THEN STCL.\n\nThese taxes are generally due the following year (unless you made a ton, more on that later), and will generally be your top income tax rate plus a little (ACA surcharge of a few %), unless you have LTCG (unlikely on this forum), or have a lot of losses to offset (likely on this forum).\n\nLastly, each position has \u2018tax lots\u2019 which are the individual times you entered the position. If you sell less than the full position, most brokerages will try to sell whatever will cause you the least taxes, which means, it will sell to make losses first, small gains next, large gains last.\n\n**Random Tips and Things To Know:**\n\n*Doom Scenario* \u2013 If you take away one thing here \u2013 if you made big gains, realize losses to zero them out, and on anything leftover, SET ASIDE THE MONEY - MAYBE 40% OF THE GAIN TO BE SAFE. You\u2019ll owe this tax on gains EVEN IF you zero out your account on January 2nd. Don\u2019t put yourself in that position.  I talk about this in detail here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jqewaw/psa\\_dont\\_forget\\_to\\_lose\\_all\\_of\\_your\\_gains\\_before/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jqewaw/psa_dont_forget_to_lose_all_of_your_gains_before/)\n\n*Loss Harvesting* \u2013 A common year end strategy is to dump your losers BEFORE the end of the year so you can put them against your gains. If you have some old now worthless options sitting around that wont expire until next year, there\u2019s big benefit to selling these off if you have gains.  TLDR \u2013 realize your losses, probably now or really soon. Beware wash sale though\u2026\n\n*Wash Sales* \u2013 If you sell something at a loss, and rebuy the exact same thing within 31 days, the realize is cancelled out, and the loss is added back into the cost basis of the stock. You still can get this loss, you just don\u2019t get to call it a realized loss and offset gains with it until sold for 31 days without a rebuy. In theory, this MAY apply to call options on the same ticker\u2026 but it\u2019s a grey area, and the IRS has not given clear guidance on this for decades despite this being a known issue. Proceed with caution here. It is agreed that if you use the EXACT SAME option, wash sale 100% applied. For different options on same ticker, it\u2019s grey and not agreed upon by CPAs (conservative rule is \u2013 assume it\u2019s a wash sale).\n\n*Splitting gains over tax years* \u2013 If you have phat gains now, hedging a bit and realizing some now, some early January may be prudent so you can spread the income over lower tax brackets. Easy strategy to do.\n\n*Holding for LTCG* \u2013 In theory, if you hold an option or stock more than a year, it becomes LTCG rate which is lower. But who does that here? Hedging these gains with put options is considered kosher with the IRS.   So, if your SHOP you got in March is up 1000% and you want to sell now, you could just buy puts into March to protect, then realize then, and pay fewer taxes via long term capital gains rate... and grab a small short term loss on those options if price didn\u2019t go down. \n\n*Income Offset* \u2013 You can writeoff $3k of losses against your primary income every year for free, no questions asked. But it does eat into your loss reserve.\n\n*Estimated Quarterly Payments* \u2013 When you make lots and lots of money, you are expected to pay those income taxes before filing date in April. This varies by states, so check the rules if you are making A LOT (100k+ usually). For federal, you owe these up until the point where you have paid the full amount of federal tax you paid the previous year \u2013 amounts over this you aren\u2019t on the hook to pre-pay. There are guides online for how to play a 1040-es and so forth. TLDR - make a lot of money, check your state rules, and make sure youve paid as much federal already or will have paid by end of year as you paid last year.\n\n*Charitable Donations* \u2013 Charitable donations do reduce tax liability. Better is to DONATE SHARES to a donor advised fund, such as what Fidelity offers, then direct the DAF to give to the charity of your choice. Money in there can also appreciate over time, so you can day trade further, albeit with indexes only. The reason this is better than donating cash is you get the writeoff of the value of the shares, AND you don\u2019t cause a capital gains realize \u2013 so no capital gains tax. I would not donate options \u2013 you can, but they\u2019ll get marked to market in a somewhat unfavorable manner unless massively in the money, and even then, check before you do it!\n\n*Broker Interest -* Interest you pay your broker with a negative cash balance is deducted against your gains. Interest your broker pays to you is just income. This seldom is a big impact.\n\n*Commissions -* Because someone will ask, broker commissions are just added to your cost of shares, so they are effectively deductible and it happens automatically.\n\n*Trader Status* \u2013 You can elect to be a trader every year at normal filing deadline. If you do, ALL of your gains/losses inside designated accounts become income instead of STCG. This is desirable because losses can then go against your income, and you also don\u2019t pay the ACA surcharge on investment income. You also can deduct more things against this. But, this has strict rules to do, and only applies if you are making dozens of trades a week, trading daily, and are really making a lot of money doing it. Note that this loses the ability to use 1256 taxation and ltcg in these accounts, so its sometimes just worse. The main advantage is in bad years you can put it against your Wendy\u2019s w2.\n\n*1256 Contracts* \u2013 These are special contracts that give you 60% LTCG and 40% LTCG regardless of the hold. XSP, SPX, NDX and RUT options do this, as do most futures contracts. They also are wash sale immune, and are grown up trader hacks. I have a long ass post about this all here, but the TLDR is that for non-long-term holds with significant amounts of money, you really should be using these instead of SPY, QQQ and IWM.  Here\u2019s my post about that:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gq4e0l/taxes\\_and\\_spy\\_vs\\_spx\\_iwm\\_vs\\_rut\\_qqq\\_vs\\_ndx\\_please/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gq4e0l/taxes_and_spy_vs_spx_iwm_vs_rut_qqq_vs_ndx_please/)\n\n*GLD and SLV* \u2013 These are collectibles rate. Even worse taxes on long term than normal LTCG. FYI. Here\u2019s a treatise on why you should use other vehicles than these:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hytk5e/stop\\_overpaying\\_taxes\\_on\\_gld\\_options/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hytk5e/stop_overpaying_taxes_on_gld_options/)\n\n*Constructive Sale* \\-  If you have a long position that has made a lot, but is unrealized, and you do some crazy option trade to basically sell it (such as selling calls that are massive in the money), the IRS may decide this is a constructive sale and call it a realize. Don\u2019t get too clever on this stuff. It usually doesn\u2019t come up, but if the tax bill is large enough, it may.\n\n*QOZ:* Special tax rules for ultra rich traders with good resources, like that guy who made $5m day trading PLTR. If you made hundreds of thousands of dollars in gains, and have net worth over a few million bucks (qualified investor comfortably), you could enroll in a QOZ. This allows you to defer payment of tax on designated gains for 6 or 7 years, get a 10% discount on the amount owed, AND the investment you make is tax free on gains AND can still do return of capital with a cash-out refi (usually real estate). Getting good QOZs is hard, they aren\u2019t easily accessible, and you\u2019ll likely want to use a family office, a rich friend, or a wealth manager if you go this route. This truly is a bonanza, but it\u2019s hard to access. You have 6 months from when you realized a gain to use this.
