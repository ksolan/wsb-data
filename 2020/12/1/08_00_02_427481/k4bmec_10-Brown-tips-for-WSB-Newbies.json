{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Reading   through some of the posts I can see how some of you think so highly of yourselves that a single red day in a rocket ship stock market makes you feel like you're the next Warren Burry. Post after post  of losers making huge returns.  Everyone is getting rich but you.  Boofuckinghoo. The smart investor  realizes it\u2019s all an elaborate side  stepping of online casino laws. Some of it works, most of it doesn\u2019t. To be successful, you need to be able to recognize the difference and to  do that, you need hype, lots of money, and a cushy day job to fall back  on when you blow up your life savings on a YOLO.\n\nHere are ten tips that can help you along the way.\n\n**Tip 1 - You don\u2019t know shit**\n\nBut that's fine, because nobody else does either.\n\n**Tip 2 - Understand how tendies flow in the market**\n\nTendies flow to those bold enough to earn them. If volatile stocks and speculative \"investing\" scare you, go to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and park your money in an ETF.\n\n**Tip 3 - Play for the short term**\n\nThe   most important rule you need to follow religiously is ALL COMPANIES  WILL EVENTUALLY GO OUT OF BUSINESS. If you look at the makeup of the  market from 1995 to now, you'll notice a glaring trend: 90% of companies  that were at the peak of the market then are now dust. You may get  lucky and pick a long term winner here and there, but understand that  hype is a bitch, there's always a bigger fish, and nothing lasts  forever. If you're not planning your bets with well defined entry and  exit points, you will end up diamond handing some losing play way too  long because your confirmation bias has convinced you that you found the  next Amazon in a sea of [pets.com](https://pets.com/)  stocks from a DD post on a forum that is self described as \"if 4chan  found a bloomberg terminal\". Picking individual stocks is for short term  gains. Park your money in an ETF or index fund if you want something  long term with an OK rate of return.\n\n**Tip 4 - Time is not on your side (if you're yolo'ing options)**\n\nTheta  gang always wins. They don't always win as big as others win, but they  always win. If you're trading short term options and you're not the one  benefiting from theta, don't be so greedy that you lose your profits to  theta decay and market volatility. A stock could end on a Friday just  barely OTM and ruin your account just to run up 20% the following Monday.\n\n**Tip 5 - Paper Trading**\n\nPaper  trading is a simulation. It behaves exactly like a real account with  real active data but it\u2019s all practice. DO THIS FOR ZERO SECONDS. Paper  trading to prepare for real trading is like a boxer only training for a  fight by hitting the heavy bag. It will help some, but it's nothing like  a real fight. Every person who says \"oh if only i had bought Apple 20 years ago I'd be a billionaire\" has never actually traded  anything risky because everyone who has knows that it's stupid to stare  at a 100% return or even a 20% return and not lock it in.\n\n**Tip 6 - Understand taxes**\n\nPlug that stuff in to turbotax and let the nerds figure this out for you.  Just remember that after each trade you make that actually earns money,  set aside some for Uncle Sam. But google \"wash sale\" if you get bored  between staring at futures and reading \"DD\" posts about chinese EV  startups.\n\n**Tip 7 - No one knows shit**\n\nYou don't know shit. I don't know shit. Nobody knows shit. Why are you reading this?\n\n**Tip 8 - Learn to read fundamentals and understand valuations**\n\nLol jk. If you're reading about company fundamentals, go park your  money in an index fund or ETF. Refer to tips 1, 3, and 7 for why this is  the right move.\n\n**Tip 9 - Get rich schemes are for winners**\n\nRefer  to tip 8. You're not here to try to guess which company will be the  next Amazon by 2050. You're hear to scalp sick gains and retire early.  If you're not shooting for at least a 3-5% monthly growth in your  portfolio, skip the hassle and park your money in an ETF or index fund.\n\n**Tip 10 - Discipline and dedication**\n\nLike   anything in life, to be successful you have to fucking work at it and  be incredibly lucky in being at the right place and right time. Be  disciplined in your entry and exit points for each play, but don't over  think shit.\n\n\\--\n\nFor   those of you this resonates with, I look forward to seeing the loss  porn on the next red market day. Do the  work. For those of you  who love chasing the fantasy of actually knowing what you're  doing, good luck, I  mean it. It\u2019s a tough fucking pill to swallow  realizing that you're not some investing prodigy and that your hundreds  of hours of \"DD\" will woefully underperform the mouth breathers who hit a  couple of lucky plays and never have to work again in their lives.\n\nPeace.", "author_fullname": "t2_xoac1", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "10 Brown tips for WSB Newbies", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Shitpost"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "shitpost", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_k4bmec", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 48, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": true, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Shitpost", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 48, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1606818821.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Reading   through some of the posts I can see how some of you think so highly of yourselves that a single red day in a rocket ship stock market makes you feel like you&#39;re the next Warren Burry.
