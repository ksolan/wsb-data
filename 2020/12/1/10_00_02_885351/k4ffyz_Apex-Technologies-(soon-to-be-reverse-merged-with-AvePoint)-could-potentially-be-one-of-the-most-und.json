I haven\u2019t seen any dd posts recently so consider this a reminder and don\u2019t get caught sleeping. \n\nFor those that haven\u2019t heard, the private company AvePoint and the public SPAC Apex Technologies agreed to a reverse merger last week that will become official by Q1 2021, most likely by the end of January or beginning of February. \n\nSo, what is AvePoint? AvePoint was founded in 2001 and is a partner of Microsoft. They work in management, protection, and storage of data for Microsoft office 365. (I know you retards apparently love data companies like PLTR so this is right up your alley).\n\nAvePoint has strong business relations with Microsoft and has won Microsoft company of the year 5 of a possible 19 times and the Microsoft VP sits on the board of directors for AvePoint. They also have some legitimate leadership with one of their co-founders being the former CFO of Oracle and the other co-founder being the former head of tech investing at Goldman Sachs. \n\nOn top of that their financials are pretty phenomenal as they have no outstanding debt, 250 million in cash reserves, are profitable, and have been growing in revenue steadily YoY. They are projected to grow roughly 40% in revenue by 2022 too, as they are seeing huge upticks in demand as businesses around the globe are continually transitioning to cloud services and moving their businesses online. \n\nAvePoint will be priced at a $2 billion valuation once the merger is official and they go public.  \n\nFor comparison one of their main competitors, Snowflake, is valued at about 90 billion, while having about only twice the current revenue of AvePoint\u2019s. \n\nHypothetically, if AvePoint were to become half the value of Snowflake based on revenues, it would be worth more than 20x what it will be at the time it goes public. \n\nNot saying it\u2019s going to become worth 45 billion but we could see it balloon to 20 billion+ easily, which would still be about 15x what it is now. \n\nLastly, they currently do not have calls but as the merger date gets closer, options will be added so you idiots can blow up your accounts on FDs. \n\nTL;DR Buy apex Technologies and be prepared for the rocket ride. \n\nPositions: 400 shares", "author_fullname": "t2_13w4c0", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Apex Technologies (soon to be reverse merged with AvePoint) could potentially be one of the most undervalued plays on the market.", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_k4ffyz", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 35, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 35, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1606832938.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Alright retards here me out as I give a quick dd on AvePoint/ Apex Technologies and why it could be a potential rocket ship to Mars.
