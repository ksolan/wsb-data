You probably don't care about that because I know that none of you can do statistics anyway, but you should. Why? It basically indicates is that **95% of the time, significant movement outside of the bands is not going to last**. This is incredibly useful for timing entry points and exit points throughout the day.\n\nWhat I've found is that **a significant jump outside of the range created by the Bollinger bands is usually followed by a reversal, allowing you to maximize your profits** on exit by selling at a peak or on entry by buying at a trough. Let's use everyone's favorite meme stock of the week as an example. Focus on the examples circled in white for now.\n\n[PLTR, the morning of 11\\/30, 1-minute candlestick graph with Bollinger bands](https://preview.redd.it/o8popcybei261.jpg?width=1557&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf8a85fc29173930ba5e0b9632a5b5f42cc77a2c)\n\nIn each of the pairs of white circles, there is significant movement outside of the bands and relatively high volume, which is followed by either a retracement or a reversal. The first and last pairs show the stock price extending more significantly beyond the Bollinger bands for longer periods of time, along with relatively higher volume than the middle two examples. Here, the first and last pairs are reversals, while the middle two pairs are retracements. **The stronger the signals, the more likely it is to be a legitimate reversal instead of a retracement**. If you want to, you can combine this with other indicators like RSI if you know what you're doing, but volume is a pretty good indicator of signal strength on its own.\n\nOn the other hand, if the stock price steadily hugs one of the bands, it usually indicates a legitimate trend. You can use this to hop on an uptrend if you're buying, or to cut your losses if you're selling. The magenta example shows a clear downtrend. Note that the stock price hugs the lower band, never falling significantly below it. It's accompanied by relatively high volume, so you know that the signal is strong.\n\nI've only been trading for 7 months, but I've been doing much better since I've started paying attention to these indicators. I pretty much only use the 1-minute graph with this, although it can likely be applied to other relatively short periods too. I'm not saying this will let you see every reversal before it happens like some sort of psychic, but it's a hell of a lot better than flying blind. Start using them, you can thank me later.\n\nAlso: APHA and PSTH to the fucking moon!!!!!!!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "author_fullname": "t2_isrf3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Bollinger Bands are NOT Astrology - Use Them to Time Your Moves", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Technicals"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "technicals", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 81, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"o8popcybei261": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 62, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o8popcybei261.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9e9285d64dfd3deab5d980eb073dddd08de775f4"}, {"y": 125, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o8popcybei261.jpg?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0519bcc25f012dc3402e7b2b48b43e278b93b332"}, {"y": 185, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o8popcybei261.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=29c14b17b9efdcf7e241e71abdaa4ef321147e66"}, {"y": 371, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o8popcybei261.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=cffa6a0ce044f3282aac9fab84a4ebdfde501e06"}, {"y": 557, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o8popcybei261.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=7e526809b1949403937463f54322dae5a785f1ab"}, {"y": 627, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o8popcybei261.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=83aa6a0b4addef1ea8395ae2264aca901ebf3489"}], "s": {"y": 905, "x": 1557, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o8popcybei261.jpg?width=1557&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf8a85fc29173930ba5e0b9632a5b5f42cc77a2c"}, "id": "o8popcybei261"}}, "name": "t3_k4eu5a", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 37, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Technicals", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 37, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Zqacool7Lebr7zSXpacGqrWiunUl4FmCSAShlBzPoBA.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1606830357.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A lot of you fuckers shit on TA, but Bollinger bands are actually great for letting you know when a stock is actually breaking out instead of just temporarily overbought or oversold, especially when combined with relatively high volume.</p>\n\n<p>It represents a range of (usually) plus or minus 2 standard deviations above a moving average, which is (usually) set at 20 periods.
