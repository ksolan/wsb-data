After seeing numerous posts of some pretty wild and crazy charts the past few months, congrats to those of you have won the lottery by the way, I decided to offer this PSA to those of you who want to \"do it right\" moving forward.  A few users on here are already doing this and I promise the sooner you act like them the better.\n\nAlso, some of you may have stumbled upon my earlier post: [New Category Needed: Tax Bill Porn](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ikus0l/new_category_needed_tax_bill_porn/) and I am already popping my popcorn to wait for the wreckage.  \n\n**TLDR: Who will benefit from this... anybody that is currently trading stocks/options/etc in a non-IRA account.**\n\nOkay you millennials and slows (I'm looking at you Robinhood users), here is some free advice as my Xmas gift to you.  It's free so you are guaranteed to get your money's worth if not more.\n\n**Qualified vs Non-Qualified Accounts:** Let's start with the basics here and this entire write-up will be basic.... there are essentially two types of account that you can open and trade in called \"qualified\" and \"non-qualified\" accounts.  Qualified accounts mean there are tax advantages to using this type of structure and non-qualified means there are no tax advantages per se.  Disadvantages will be covered in a moment but let's stay here for just a minute.  When you trade inside of a qualified account and grow your money (called \"capital gains\" in bog boy/girl speak) you are allowed to DEFER taxes owed on that growth until waaaaaaay far down the line.  How far you ask??  Until you're 59.5 years old or beyond (currently).  Trading a non-qualified account, however, has no tax deferral advantage and therefore you owe taxes NOW on that money (at current income tax rate if your gain occurred in less than 12 months and at a lower rate if your gain occurred in over 12 months).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Example: You started 2020 with an account value of $0 and after making a deposit or two, YOLO'ing your money into retarded OTM options that hit, kept doing the same and kept hitting, rinse repeat rinse repeat rinse repeat etc etc, and on December 31, 2020 you now have 5X what you started with, or 10X, or 100X, doesn't really matter, NOW YOU HAVE CAPITAL GAINS AND NOW YOU MIGHT HAVE CREATED A TAXABLE EVENT, and potentially a very big one.\n\nIf you made all those short term trades inside of a non-qualified account, which I'm guessing might be the case for many users here, you may owe big and candidly I can't wait to see the posts popping up in Feb/March/April 2021.\n\nIf you made those short term trades inside of a qualified account, however, you owe NOTHING today.  That is right, ZERO.  In the future you will pay taxes on that but the future is not known and the future rules are not known either so who cares.  It's a wozy it's a woozy it's not on the elemental chart.  Are you with me??\n\n**Advantages of Tax Deferral:**  If you followed me this far you are probably wondering, \"But dude, there is no way Uncle Sam is letting me skate without paying taxes, right?!?\" and you are half right.  Uncle Sam is not giving you a free pass but rather he (or she, I want to be PC here since these are sensitive times) is allowing you to pay taxes at some point in the future when you begin to use the wealth you have accumulated for a purpose he feels is appropriate like funding your retirement.  Why?  Probably because he knows social security won't cover all your costs and probably because some lobbyist think tanks convinced Congress to do some stuff decades ago that is helping you now.  All you need to know is that by using a qualified account to be trading in you can turn Uncle Sam into your wife's boyfriend's personal bitch boy and there is nothing he/she/them can do about it.\n\n**Disadvantages of Tax Deferral:** I feel it is worth highlighting two noteworthy disadvantages to trading within a qualified account because they're important.  First, once you place your money into the account you have somewhat \"locked\" it there for many years to come.  It can grow, it can shrink, or it can stay the same size (insert giggling here) but you cannot access the funds until age 59.5 or after (under current rules) without incurring penalties AND taxes owed on the gains, assuming you have them.  Second, there is a limit to how much you're allowed to put into qualified accounts every year because even though Uncle Sam is willing to temporarily get down on his knees and felate you with tax advantages he isn't going to allow you to finish on his face.\n\n**Limitations of Qualified \"Tax Advantaged\" Accounts:** Because I am trying to keep things simple here let's establish a few ground rules on limitations.  Traditional/Roth IRAs cannot have more than $6,000 contributed to them in 2020 and 2021.  Other forms of qualified accounts such as SEP IRAs, Solo 401Ks, and some others may differ but we're not going to touch those here.  There are also reasons why you'd go Traditional vs Roth, and back door Roths, and blah blah blah but we're KISS.  The important info follows instead.\n\nIf you have had gains for 2020 so far (ie you bought something at $X and sold it at more than $X) then you can't do anything about the taxes you'll owe on that now.  But you can get really smart in the next month and open a NEW account and fund it (with up to $6K) so that moving forward any gains will be taxed VERY differently.  And, after Jan 1, 2021 you can add another $6K (if you have it) so that 31 days from now you can start the YOLO cycle all over again with $12,000 and ALL gains will be taxed a loooong time from now for many people here, as long as you can get by without accessing those funds until a loooooong time from now.\n\n**So What? Too Long, Didn't Even Read The TLDR:** So what is the following... Some of us have had great years and that is awesome.  In case you didn't make the most of this gift for 2020 you (presumably) have many more years with which to take this info and run with it.  Most experienced/older investors have numerous accounts, both qualified and non-qualified.  Strategically they likely base trades and plays in different accounts for different reasons (ie if you plan to hold an investment for more or less than 12 months), and you should too.  A few users on here with huge accounts have even flexed this recently and I encourage all of you to flood them with PMs asking them which type of account you should open. (jk)\n\nBut if you've read this far and you haven't already started researching the difference between IRA account types and rules and regulations then I promise you it will in fact be YOU playing the role of beta cuck to your wife's boyfriend's uncle come April 2021.  In truth I hope that at least a few people read this and benefit from it and I hope that in 2021 we can celebrate more gains AND no taxes!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: Buy orders aplenty today while quality meme stocks are on sale.\n\nDisclaimer: This was not tax advice.
