The new Rural Digital Opportunity Fund payouts come well below the hundreds of millions in annual cash CenturyLink enjoyed under past programs, endangering a stable revenue source. Filling the void with more winning bids: new players like cable operator Charter Communications and SpaceX. (andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com; @drewfitzgerald) \n\nMany saw this as a huge blow to revenues, but this was business that sharps believe LUMN did not want to win due to the low margins. \n\nPlus they have more lucrative contracts already locked up and we all know Elon has no problem running in the red to build a business. \n\nActually there were more bidders for ever for this business and the FCC had set aside $16B for this auction and only had to use $9.6B - it was a race to the bottom. \n\nThe average 10-day volume before the dip after hours was 10MM shares a day. \n\nThe next day over 16MM volume and the stock rebounded - it was a buying opportunity for the heavy hitters to add on the dip and they did. \n\nToday the overall market pulled back and LUMN was up again on higher than normal volume - 13MM. \n\nIt is being acquired by institutions, also the dividend is very attractive for these types of investors that hold 5-7 years. \n\nThe play on LUMN is 5G fiber and here is how:\n\nCenturyLink can thrive in a 5G world\nDespite this massive, long-term decline, it could see an upswing as analysts forecast an increase in profits. Why? Put simply, instead of destroying CenturyLink, 5G may have saved the company.\n\nAs it so happens, 5G networks remain heavily dependent on fiber. From an infrastructure perspective, the biggest difference between the previous 4G LTE standard and the current 5G is the number of cells needed. Instead of one cell every few miles, 5G requires numerous small cells located close to one another. \n\nAs a result, carriers have exponentially more cells, and they all need to connect to their networks. To do this, carriers such as AT&T (NYSE:T), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) will need CenturyLink's fiber. Hence, instead of fiber becoming obsolete, it may become more important than ever to the telecom industry.\n\nWhich brings me to:\n\nAn old company with a new name\nWill Healy (Lumen Technologies): The fiber company long known as CenturyLink has become an afterthought as consumers increasingly embrace wireless. Moreover, some investors might assume that a wireless telco industry makes fiber networks obsolete.\n\nThey should think again.\n\nThe exponentially higher number of 5G antennas will depend in large measure on fiber networks for backhaul. Furthermore, the Internet of Things (IoT) will also rely heavily on fiber to enable edge computing.\n\n\nAdditionally, Lumen is also well positioned for a popular Democratic program -- rural broadband. Based in Monroe, Louisiana, Lumen has used its network to offer high-speed internet to some rural areas. This could help Joe Biden, who has pledged broadband for \"every American\" in an effort to reach rural voters. Biden also worked to expand broadband access when he was vice president.\n\nLumen stock has experienced a secular decline since 2007 as consumers dropped landlines and cable TV. Moreover, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than eight does not seem so cheap given tepid earnings growth. Furthermore, missed deadlines on SEC filings and a falling dividend have also hurt the stock.\n\nHowever, even the reduced annual dividend of $1.00 per share still yields just over 9%. Also, with a free cash flow of $803 million exceeding the $291 million cost of its dividend in its most recent quarter, the payout should remain safe.\n\nRegardless of who wins the election, Lumen stock could benefit as the company repurposes its network to support 5G and IoT. Nonetheless, if a Biden administration subsidizes rural broadband, Lumen could receive an additional boost.\n\nIn summary, this is not Century Link anymore, it\u2019s something much different and ready to be a 5G PLAYER.  \n\nI would have YOLO\u2019d this one as well as I have 140 January 2022 $15c at an average of .50. \n\nI believe this has the legs and from what I laid out here think $30-40 could be realistic by Q4 2021. \n\nLots of value and the big boys know it and are acquiring it.", "author_fullname": "t2_10x7vki9", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "LUMN - getting ready for breakout", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Discussion"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ka8xxy", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1607579051.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1607605071.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It may not sound like the sexiest play, but this stock is being acquired in big chunks by big players.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fintel.io/i/scion-asset-management-llc\">https://fintel.io/i/scion-asset-management-llc</a></p>\n\n<p>Michael Barry\u2019s Sicon bought 800,000 shares in Q3. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/mason-hawkins-southeastern-strengthens-connection-192315526.html\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/mason-hawkins-southeastern-strengthens-connection-192315526.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Southeastern Asset Management, the investment firm founded by Mason Hawkins (Trades, Portfolio) in 1975, disclosed it increased its stake in Lumen Technologies Inc.
