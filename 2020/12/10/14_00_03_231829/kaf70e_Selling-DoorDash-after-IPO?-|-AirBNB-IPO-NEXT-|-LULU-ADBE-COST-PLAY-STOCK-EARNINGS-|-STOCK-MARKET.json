Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/bzmy8C4) drop almost 2% and suffering its biggest loss since October after the 4-day win streak, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Kw3DKxD) also dropped .80% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/9GvPGh5) did much better, down just .35% for the day. We saw a huge spike in the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/RcShWPM) of over 7% closing at the highest level since the 23rd of November.\n\nWe saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/YkqyTgh) as finally some stocks have started to move below the moving averages on about average volume for the day.\n\nWe saw most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/Wfn4Trj) in the red yesterday as Tech and Communications suffered the most dropping more than 1% for the day, with small gains being made in just the Industrials, Energy and Materials sectors as Growth companies suffered the most [yesterday](https://ibb.co/5hQKP88), especially the Large-Caps as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/V9bfV71), with all the big FAANG names and other big tech companies being deep in the red as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix dropped more than 2% for the day, while FB, Google and Microsoft also lost over 1%, but the big loser yesterday was Tesla losing 7% for the day.\n\nToday we will get some critical economic [data](https://ibb.co/qnkdTJz), and if this disappoints, we might see another big drop in the stock market, as the jobless claims will start us off in the early morning.\n\nAlongside this economic data, today the [FDA](https://ibb.co/0906d6L) may approve the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, that could lead to a vaccine rollout starting next week. This might help the markets have a more positive reaction if the FDA grants the authorization.\n\nOne good thing in my opinion is that the most recent [survey](https://ibb.co/5WPhj8B) from the AAII showed a slight decrease in Bullish and Neutral investors while the Bearish camp gained more than 4% in the last week.\n\nInvestors had gotten very bullish in the last weeks and this usually is a contrarian indicator, so seeing this small drop is a good thing to see, as I want more and more people to start feeling bearish so I can find and buy stocks at more attractive prices than the current ones. So, the more bearish people get, the more I like to get on and buy stocks. But still\u2026 there is to much of a concentration in the bull\u2019s camp so we might have to wait a little, for more fear to appear in the stock market.\n\nPositive indicators also popped up yesterday as Wholesale [invetories](https://ibb.co/WxPPLpS) rose more than expected in October, as this led the Atlanta FED to maintain they\u2019re Q4 GDP [estimates](https://ibb.co/SBZPtZP), while [Goldman](https://ibb.co/sQ42gCg) also thinks the economy will recover faster than expected starting with Q4 and going on next year.\n\nWhile on the jobs front, October job opening came in [better](https://ibb.co/4VdrTbQ) than expected at over 6,6M, as the job opening rate stood at 6,7% while the quits rate at just 2,2%.\n\nSo, DoorDash went live [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LJtbPtH) at 182$ which is insane in my opinion, the current price gives the company a [valuation](https://ibb.co/kcBcpYW) of over $70B, more than 4 times what the company raised at the last private fundraising six months ago. This valuation is higher than Chipotle, Yum Brands, Domino\u2019s and many others from the food industry.\n\nAnd by the way, don\u2019t forget the stock is [trading](https://ibb.co/CP0Qgbr) at over 30 times sales of this year, which were hugely boosted by the current situation, and that food delivery is really hard for any company, especially one that expects to grow to have a share of more than 50% of the entire world in the sector so that it can justify the current valuation.\n\nOne of the biggest gainers from this is SoftBank as they have a big stake in the company. The shares of SoftBank [skyrocketed](https://ibb.co/GnTSqJf) yesterday to new highs in almost two decades. Like almost every time, the biggest gainers in this IPOs are the banks and not us the retail investors.\n\nWith the other big [IPO](https://ibb.co/Ld0pMdz) yesterday being C3.ai which also opened way above the IPO price, as investors can\u2019t get enough of this stock\u2019s, I don\u2019t think this is a healthy hype for this type of IPOs, investors expect every new company to just skyrocket but, not all of them will, and paying such a high premium is not worth it most time, better wait for a pullback before getting some action on these stocks.\n\nToday we will see [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/Hxd70Tb) go public, as the valuation for this company also gets higher and higher, as they have started selling shares for 68$ even higher than the latest targeted price between 56-60$. And if DoorDash is any [indication](https://ibb.co/8cb3yTs), I don\u2019t think we will be able to get our hands on this stock below 100$. Way above my 70-80$ max price that I am willing to pay, so I am going to wait this out also until they have a pullback, maybe once the first earnings come out, that will be the case. But if somehow the IPO is under 80$ and especially under 70$ I would be willing to get some action.\n\nSome other [news](https://ibb.co/H4Pxqmq) from the stock market which pushed companies like Facebook lower came in when almost every US state filed a lawsuit against the company. In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don\u2019t really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.\n\nWhile [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.\n\nAlso, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave & Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.\n\nI expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it\u2019s the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.\n\nLikewise, [Dave & Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren\u2019t hit so badly like before or like this quarter.\n\nWhile [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium.\n\nAdobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?\n\nSo, guys, don\u2019t forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0).\n\nInvestors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%. With by far the worst results seen in investors who removed all of the exposure to equities, they are down 6% for the year.\n\nJust be patient, trust the companies that you like and keep investing every time you can. In the long-run markets will always go UP & UP.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content!
