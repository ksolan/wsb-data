{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "You all know about the greatest tech company TSLA, right? It's so damn cheap right now.\n\nI mean they are taking over the world by their fleet of autonomous taxi, as Papa Elon said in 2019 that they would do it in 2020. Sure, we still see no autonomous Tesla taxi's, but since Papa Musk said, we can assume it has happened, right?\n\nYeah, I know you are a hater, you will say that their revenues almost all of it comes from selling low margin cars, but at least we can assume that within 2035 they will be the ONLY supplier and operator of autonomous taxi services, which will unlock so much tendies, that current valuation is irrelevant.\n\nSure, lawmakers will tax and vat the hell out of this kinds of services, so the margins would get eroded, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Imagine big, then imagine even bigger, that's how big Tesla will be.\n\nOh, you are saying that people said the same thing about Cisco, Yahoo and Microsoft in dot-com bubble? But you do know that, Microsoft stock recovered from the crash in 2015? So, Tesla will of course recover within a day or two even if it crashes for any reason.\n\nOh, you are now saying it's a $500B company, and is even bigger than even Berkshire? Well, what does  Berkshire even do, except having about $100B+ in Apple stock, owning a battery manufacturer, chocolate company, railway company, bank stocks, pharmaceutical stocks and so many other things in the that they have a literal wikipedia list.\n\nNow you are telling me that competitors can ACTUALLY make electric cars and compete with Tesla. To that I say, \"nah\".\n\nWhat the hell are you shit-talking about Tesla's energy business? It is capturing some market from competitors; sure it's costly and costing Tesla a fortune and the entire margin in this whole thing will be TINY, but it's nothing compared to the potential, you know? Tesla can always issue stocks to ensure that they can keep on capturing market like that. You do realize that battery tech is one of Tesla's only strength right now? Even though batteries are supplied by LG and Panasonic mostly. This helps vertical integration.\n\nYou say vertical integration could lead to inflexibility and higher capex while providing comparatively low benefit and that's why all other companies avoid it? I don't know what to say, you are a hater. Believe in Elon.\n\nWhat? The insurance business is worthless? I know Buffet himself said that in the long run insurance business will be a net zero-profit business, but don't get ahead of yourself. This will provide precious cash-flow which Tesla will surely need. And also who is Buffet again, Elon will go against the current in the insurance business and will generate billions of profit from this business, the economics of insurance business doesn't matter, he will make his own economics.\n\nWhat, analyst what? Goldman Sachs and Ark are bullish on Tesla and have a very high price target, granted they have their conflict of interest just like J.P Morgan is trying to shit on Tesla for no apparent reason for their conflict of interest.\n\nOther businesses? Well, count them as also very important, like at least $50B in valuation now, when Tesla stock quadruples, it will be worth $200B.\n\nAre you trying to say that Tesla will not quadruple within the next year because it's already a $500B+ company? Nah, the market cap doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is the stock price. When Papa Elon splits the stock market cap will automatically double at least. And then the next split will help it quadruple.\n\nYou saying that they are worth more than the entire auto manufacturers in USA, Europe etc? Well they are auto company mostly(even though they have hundreds of similarly diversified business), but Tesla is a tech company, and when you are a tech company, valuation doesn't matter. Just look at Snowflake.\n\nPS, PE, PEG? Are you a bean counter or what? Look at Snowflake, a TECH company, that's much more expensive compared to Tesla. And also, the matrics behind judging these things is only share price. If the share price is lower, the stock is cheaper, can you argue with that?\n\nAlso, you do know that SpaceX is going to help us go to Mars and colonize it. How much fucking trillions of dollar is it worth, heh? Plus, Boring company will make hyperloop and so many things. Plus Neuralink, remember??\n\nYou are just a hater.\n\nEdit: trolls seems to be downvoting.", "author_fullname": "t2_7r79rqlg", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "TSLA stock so cheap right now", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Satire"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "satire", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kah3ty", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Satire", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 29, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1607620906.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1607642438.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>You all know about the greatest tech company TSLA, right?
