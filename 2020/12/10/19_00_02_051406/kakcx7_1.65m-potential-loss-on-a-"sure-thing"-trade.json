{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Guys, I'm posting this not to make fun of u/kumurule but to show how a trade can fuck you quickly and you won't be able to fix it without having insane amounts of cash to put out.\n\nYesterday kumurule [posted screenshots](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9x7tz/get_rich_with_this_strategymin_profit_of_600_and/)  of 300 put spreads and 300 call spreads on the same underlying. QS trading at around $73 right now, he sold 300 -75/45 put contracts and 300 -50/75 call contracts. 600 credit spreads total. \n\nSome quick math: \n\n* \\-75/45 put spread is $30 wide, so that represents a 3k max loss on the spread, multiplied by 300 = **900k max loss on the put side alone.** And it's already ITM.\n* \\-50/75 call spread is $25, meaning a $2500 max loss per contract, x300 contracts = **750k max loss on the put side.** \n* **Overall max loss of 1.65 million.** \n\nNow you'd think that he can only get fucked on one side of this, right? Actually...\n\nSince both his call spreads and put spreads are  ITM (in the money) and at risk of assignment, it creates a domino effect of losses if any one contract is assigned, (which happens often when something is deep ITM). \n\nLet's look at what one executed call contract would do:\n\n* Someone decides to execute their 50 call and kumurule is now short 100 shares of QS because his long call is not ITM. There's currently a $23 difference between his short strike and the current market price. **That's $2300 because each contract represents 100 shares.** \n* If he doesnt have $2300/contract to pay that loss, then RH will close his positions to cover the loss even thought they're barely profitable. **So he's no longer protected by his put side as they will be closed early.** \n\nNow let's look at his put side:\n\n* His put side isn't deep ITM so the risk of early assignment is lower since he has January expiration. It's also an uptrending stock. But, if it goes up, his puts are closed early to cover so he's fucked. If it goes down, his call side will show profit, but again, people likely will execute their deep ITM calls when they see QS dropping to realize profit quickly.  \n* I'm actually less concerned about the put side even though it's a larger potential max loss because 1) it's not deep ITM and 2) the stock is uptrending. \n* If kumurule can close all his calls, he *may* be able to wait out the stock and on expiration day, if it's still ITM, he can roll out farther and possible change it to a -70/40p spread and hope the stock has enough time to recover.\n* **but** I don't think he will be able to do that because of assignments on the call side that will hit him left and right and he will probably end up with his account frozen unless he ponies up large amounts of cash to cover.\n\nWanna know what happens when RH freezes your account? You have to fucking *email them* so they manually close your positions. So if QS drops to 69 and suddenly his call spreads are profitable, he better hope it stays that low while RH slowly checks their email and executes the trade for him. \n\nYa'll better pray this stock tanks today so he can exit the call side and then he can manage the put side, because otherwise, this is a going to be a 6 figure loss. \n\n**Best case scenario:**\n\nThe absolute best case scenario for this trade would be that QS tanks today (but the contracts aren't executed) and he's able to close all calls. That would leave him with put spreads that aren't deep ITM and probably won't be assigned early. \n\nIf that happens, he can always roll his put spreads out and down and wait for the stock to catch up to his short strike and eventually realize the profit from the put spreads to mitigate the call losses.\n\n**Worst case scenario:**\n\nDomino effect happens, he's getting margin calls left and right, RH will close for him, he won't have a chance for the put side to make a profit and he will end up with **at least a 6 figure loss.**\n\n**GUYS IF IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN LOSE AND IT'S A BIG PREMIUM YOU'RE RECEIVING, I PROMISE, THERE ARE VERY BIG WAYS TO LOSE.**", "author_fullname": "t2_5evo9mdy", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "1.65m potential loss on a \"sure thing\" trade", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Discussion"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_kakcx7", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 65, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 65, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1607623662.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1607652128.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Guys, I&#39;m posting this not to make fun of <a href=\"/u/kumurule\">u/kumurule</a> but to show how a trade can fuck you quickly and you won&#39;t be able to fix it without having insane amounts of cash to put out.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday kumurule <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9x7tz/get_rich_with_this_strategymin_profit_of_600_and/\">posted screenshots</a>  of 300 put spreads and 300 call spreads on the same underlying.
