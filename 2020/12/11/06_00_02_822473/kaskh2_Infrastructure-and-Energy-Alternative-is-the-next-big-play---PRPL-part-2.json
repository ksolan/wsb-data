{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "If you weren\u2019t in Purple when it popped then you fucked up, and here is your next chance.\n\n\\*Infrastructure and Energy Alternative has options now\u2026 were added recently. Also has warrants.\n\nTHIS IS NOT A SPAC. HAS NOT BEEN A SPAC FOR OVER 2 YEARS.\n\n(Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is a renewable energy construction company that has grown massively since its SPAC days in 2018. At the time the company was pulling about 460mm of revenue, and now has a back log of about 2bn +, while also becoming cash positive (last 2 quarters they posted positive eps, with the latest at .33 eps). EBITDA increased from 36mm to a whopping 125mm. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative currently trades at roughly 6x EV/EBITDA.\n\nWhat does this all mean?\n\nIf you have been paying attention you would notice a lot of green energy companies have been flying. We are looking at insane valuations for certain companies which are all becoming overvalued. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is NOT overvalued and is in fact the opposite and WAY UNDERVALUED. This company has a market cap less than 260mm but pulls 2bn in revenue (and is currently profitable AND still growing). Infrastructure and Energy Alternative has a P/S of 0.13\u2026. madness.\n\nWith Biden\u2019s 2 TRILLION infrastructure plan, Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is poised to pull in more and more revenue while winning more contracts. In a few years this is a company that could potentially be pulling 8bn + revenue if they keep up the same level of growth since 2018. They also do civil work but 70% of their revenue comes from renewables. They are #1 in Wind and #12 (and growing) in solar nationwide. In their last CC they highlighted the fact that they will continue to focus on solar and are looking to cement more and more contracts in this area.\n\nThey currently sit at $11.35/share with the warrants at 1.53. Current market cap is about 250mm.\n\nMy short term target here is $20 per share, which is still under 500mm market cap\u2026 so even at $20 this is laughably undervalued. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative has a small float (around 23million OS) but heavy insider ownership so the tradeable float is actually a lot smaller, so this can move quickly with enough volume. I have been watching this and with only 1million in volume it has pumped 20-30% in a day. The ATH of mid-14s was just a few weeks back and the stock has slide since then (there has been no bad news\u2026 possible manipulation here). So at the very least, you SHOULD see around a 50% gain short term as Infrastructure and Energy Alternative should surpass recent ATH.\n\nInfrastructure and Energy Alternative in comparison to other companies:\n\nRUN: Has over 200m shares os and 10-13B MC, with only 875m annual Revs and 8.9m Net Profits. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative Revenues and profits are greater.\n\nROAD: 1.5bn Market cap (6x greater than Infrastructure and Energy Alternative market cap) and trades at x12 EV/EBITDA (double Infrastructure and Energy Alternative). These guys are a construction company as well\u2026 but focus on roads (obviously) and have nothing to do with the bullish green/renewables sector. Also less revenue than Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. ROAD eps is a bit higher though.\n\nThere is a looming 1bn massive solar project from Invenergy. No contract award has been announced yet but Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is definitely in the picture. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative HAS A HISTORY WITH INVENERGY. This is the largest solar project in USA history. If Invenergy chooses Infrastructure and Energy Alternative again for this project you best believe the stock is going to moon. I repeat, Invenergy and Infrastructure and Energy Alternative have a history of doing work with each other.\n\nI like the warrants more that the commons, why?\n\nBelow is roughly what the warrants will trade at in comparison to the commons:\n\nCommons \u2013 Warrants\n\n11-13 \u2013 1.50  \n14 - 2  \n15 \u2013 2.50  \n16 - 3  \n17 \u2013 3.50  \n18 \u2013 4  \n19 \u2013 4.50  \n20 \u2013 5  \n21 \u2013 5.50  \n22 \u2013 6  \n23 \u2013 6.50  \n24 \u2013 7  \n25 \u2013 7.50\n\nA double from here in the commons (11s \u2013 22s) is a 100% gain while $22 commons would result in roughly $6 warrants, so roughly a 300% gain from the current $1.50 warrants price. This is just short-term mind you.\n\nWarrants cannot be called in by Infrastructure and Energy Alternative unless the commons trade over $24 for 20 out of 30 trading days. WARRANTS EXPIRE IN 3 YEARS. These warrants are like a 3 year call option\u2026.. even at $25 a share the market cap is still only around 500mm market cap.\n\nThe fundamentals here for Infrastructure and Energy Alternative are strong as fuck and you can play this in many ways: go long (set and forget) the commons, send it with options (options became available a few weeks ago!) and/or go with the warrants and possibly make fucking bank.\n\nThe bear case?\n\nInfrastructure and Energy Alternative is a construction company. Margins are thin. BUT, revenue has grown by 4x in 4 years and is poised to continue growing. They have become cash positive in this time and profitable. There is no indication that this should change. All signs point to continued growth and improved margins. They have already stated the plan to pay down debt (around 300mm) so that alone will increase EPS and margins.\n\nIf you look at the historical chart. You will notice Infrastructure and Energy Alternative got hammered after it merged. This is because Infrastructure and Energy Alternative took on debt to buy civil construction companies to diversify its portfolio of renewable construction companies. There was also expressed interest by Oaktree and Ares wanting to buy the company out for under $6 a share and as a result the stock dwindled lower and lower. The buy out was rejected by the company and as it started to improve covid happened, again crushing the stock. Even when the company was \u201conly\u201d pulling 500mm in yearly rev, the price was undervalued, and now were sitting at 2bn revenue and growing.\n\nComparisons to PRPL situation:\n\nRecently Infrastructure and Energy Alternative filed an S-3 shelf registration that hinted that up to $500m could be raised in a secondary offering to fund future growth and possibly to acquire more companies. Purple also had multiple secondary offerings. If you look at PRPL's growth from $8 to $16 to past $25, each rally was after a secondary offering of the founders reselling their existing shares to institutions. Secondary offerings are good for companies that are growing. They expand institutional support (which also creates support levels for the stock) and increases float so that daily volume goes up. Purple's offering was non-dilutive while Infrastructure and Energy Alternative offering might be dilutive. However, there are only 23m shares outstanding for Infrastructure and Energy Alternative right now. If Infrastructure and Energy Alternative had even 100m shares outstanding, a $20 stock price would be a $2B market cap, with revenues projected to exceed $2B in 2021.\n\nDisclaimer: I am in the warrants and will be holding these for a while. My first target is at least $8/warrants. I think $10 warrants will happen here though (commons need to hit $30). PRPLW hit $30 commons and $10 warrants and im confident the same happens here.\n\nCheers fellas", "author_fullname": "t2_180y411x", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is the next big play - PRPL part 2", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kaskh2", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1607678759.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>If you weren\u2019t in Purple when it popped then you fucked up, and here is your next chance.</p>\n\n<p>*Infrastructure and Energy Alternative has options now\u2026 were added recently.
