{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Hi WSB,\n\n\nI thought i would take a few seconds to contribute to the community.  Recently 1ronyman 2.0 has sprung from the ashes with box spreads. What is a box spread and why are people nervous?\n\n\nA box spread is an arbitrage strategy. It takes advantage of mispriced options to create risk free value.  If its risk free, why worry? Well, its only risk free if you do it right.\n\n\n\nTo enter a box spread you need to sell a put and buy a lower strike put and sell a call and buy a higher strike call. The call you sell should be the same strike as the put you buy and the put you sell should be the same strike as the call you buy. For example SPY 350/365c spread and SPY 365/350p spread.\n\n\nIn the example above, the most you can lose at expiration is $15. If SPY>365 then the puts expire worthless and you will owe $15 on the calls. If SPY<350 the calls will expire worthless and you will owe $15. If $365>SPY>350 then the call and put will be worth something which will total $15 exactly.\n\n\n\nThe idea of the box spread is to enter a position like this and earn more in premium than the spread. If you could make $20 entering the position above, paying $15 at expiration means you make $5 per contract. Free money, right? Turns out no.\n\n\nThe problem with box spreads is that the math only works at expiration. There is no guarantee that you won't be assigned early.\n\n\n\nImagine a scenario where you enter the example box spread expiring next week. SPY is currently over 365. Say the 350c holder decides to exercise. No big deal. You have the 365c and $20 in premium. You pay out $15 and you are left with $5 and a 365/350 put spread. Then the stock starts to drop. All the sudden SPY crashes down to $330. The guy with the 365p exercises. You now owe him $15. But you only have $5 from the trade. You managed to lose $10 on a risk free trade. What went wrong? \n\n\n\nThe problem is the style of contract. SPY contracts and most other options contracts on WSB are American Style options. That means the option holder has the right the exercise the contract at ANY time.  This can lead to huge losses.\n\n\n\nWhat you need is European style options. They can only be exercised at expiration. European doesn't mean it is traded only in Europe, its just the name of the option.  For example, SPX is a European style option.\n\n\n\nLong story short, box spreads are a great strategy but be sure to only use them on European style options. Also, since algos are looking for these risk free arbitrage opportunities, good luck beating them to the punch.", "author_fullname": "t2_medfo", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Box Spreads and Option Styles", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kap1c2", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 44, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 44, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1607667045.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi WSB,</p>\n\n<p>I thought i would take a few seconds to contribute to the community.
