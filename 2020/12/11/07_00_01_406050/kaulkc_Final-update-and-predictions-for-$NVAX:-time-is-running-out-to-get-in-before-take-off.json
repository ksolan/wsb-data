{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I continue to get questions about NVAX and decided to make one final post for current and prospective NVAX holders. For those who didn\u2019t read my previous posts ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k35zlh/followup_dd_from_an_actual_scientist_about_nvax/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5464b/from_the_scientist_who_posted_the_nvax_dd_updates/)), I\u2019m currently a biomedical PhD candidate and have >5yrs of experience in vaccine R&D.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDue to several persistent misconceptions, NVAX is insanely undervalued and is poised to take off in the very near future due to the upcoming interim readout of their Phase 3 UK trial which will support global licensure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I say that I think NVAX will take off, consider that it went from $90/share to over $140/share in 4 trading days on news about setbacks to AZN's trial, which is nothing compared to the impact of the upcoming interim readout.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on \\*current\\* supply deals alone, NVAX is projected to supply more doses of their COVID vaccine to the world in 2021 than Pfizer and Moderna combined, yet NVAX sits at a market cap of $7.3B. For reference, MRNA and CVAC - two other companies with no marketed products - have market caps of $61B and $23B, respectively. Also consider that not only does CVAC have no marketed products, their COVID vaccine is still in Phase 2 (NVAX started Phase 3 in September) and their Phase 1 data looks weak (NVAX's Phase 1 data is arguably best to date).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith the supply/distribution constraints for Pfizer and Moderna, I suspect NVAX will ink several additional agreements upon release of their Phase 3 interim data. Earlier today, Australia increased their [order](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-11/coronavirus-live-blog-december-11-covid-vaccine-trials/12972448) from 40M to 51M doses due to issues with an in-country vaccine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# If all of this is true why is NVAX's market cap so low?\n\nI suspect that the *primary* reason for NVAX's low market cap is the misconception that NVAX is too far behind Pfizer/Moderna/AstraZeneca to matter because their US Phase 3 trial hasn't started.\n\n**The market doesn't seem to appreciate that they started a 15,000 person trial in the UK on September 24th which will support global licensure if successful** (my [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/) post outlined why I think the probability of success is extremely high)**.** Rarely do I see this mentioned in NYT, Bloomberg, or WSJ articles on COVID vaccine updates and as a result, I think NVAX is being incorrectly viewed as a longshot.\n\nAlthough it's not definite, the UK trial will also likely be able to support a US EUA due using a trial design harmonized with US requirements. Regardless, the timing for the US market is not nearly as important due to the fact that their funding from Operation Warp Speed ($1.6B) guarantees purchase of 100M doses as long as a viable vaccine can be delivered. There are no stipulations that they need to be first to ensure purchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# When will we get the interim readout and why is this important?\n\nThe UK trial originally had a planned interim readout at 66 events, but that's been moved up to 50 events due to anticipated high levels of efficacy (confirmed the validity of the screenshot in my last post). This means that once 50 people in the trial develop symptomatic COVID, they'll unblind and determine the percentage of people who received the vaccine versus the placebo. This type of readout is what supported the announcements made by Pfizer on 09Nov and by Moderna on 16Nov.\n\nA positive interim readout (anything >90% effective) would be enormous because it would vault NVAX into the spotlight alongside PFE/MRNA. NVAX\u2019s $7.3B market cap would quickly be in the rear view mirror. Full approval in the US would still require completion of a US based phase 3 trial (set to start imminently) but as I mentioned, US supply deal of 100M doses is already confirmed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, so when will we get 50 events in the trial?\n\nThe official language used in company press releases says that the interim data are expected \"as soon as early first quarter 2021, although the timing depends on the overall COVID-19 rate in the region.\" However, that was before they decided to change the threshold from 66 to 50 events. Also, their president of research also indicated in a meeting on November 24th that he thinks they'll get there before the end of the year because the trial is centered in several locations in the UK with extremely high rates of transmission.\n\nSince I have >90% of my portfolio invested in NVAX options, I wanted to get some more confidence around the timing of when the trial would hit 50 events and put together a model to estimate a timeframe. Although this might seem like a ridiculous exercise, I actually think it's semi-reasonable due to the meticulous level of detail that the UK's Office of National Statistics [maintains](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/datasets/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveydata) regarding COVID infections and the daily modeled incidence rates they publish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Going through the details of the model is probably overkill for WSB so skip to the end if you dont care. I\u2019m including it so I can get feedback from anyone with a stats background\n\nUsing public statements about trial enrollment numbers, I assume three periods of linear enrollment from 24Sep to 27Oct (0 to 5500), 28Oct to 09Nov (5501 to 9000), 10Nov to 27Nov (9001 to 15000). Per the clinical trial protocol, events are eligible to be counted 7 days following the second injection. As a result, infections for participants injected on day 0 (24Sep) aren\u2019t counted until 22Oct (1st shot + 21 days for 2nd shot + 7 days). Screenshot below should help to explain better if that's not clear. I also assume a 10% dropout rate, a 15% asymptomatic rate, and a 100% vaccine efficacy rate (this actually makes the projection more conservative).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cmnb8pz6h461.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ccfa13f90793285b382d0f2ebeb3f9134e41654\n\nBecause the probability of infection increases over time and there are different rates of infection on different days, I treat each row of the above table as an independent group to estimate the number infections over time based on the daily modeled infection rates. A screen shot of the table I used is below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h5mciai07h461.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed9031712307e8052df3559e45397c313f47fc22\n\nI divided each daily number by 10,000 to calculate an individual incidence rate per day and then used these daily incidents rates to determine cumulative incidence rates over different periods of time and then apply that to each group of participants in a rolling window. See below to get an idea of the calculation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eplpltd17h461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e1c1bbb6940c5b65db7145c7cf4e236769548b4\n\nThe modelled incidence rates from ONS stop at 22Nov. For the dates beyond then and into the future, I duplicated numbers on the low end from the published period, which is probably more conservative than what we\u2019ll see in reality. Another important difference is that the modeled incidence rates are for England (pop. 55M) but the trial is performed across the entire UK (pop 66M) which also makes the incidence rates more conservative. I\u2019m ok with these factors being too conservative since the linear enrollment assumption is almost certainly too optimistic.\n\n**With those caveats, my model estimates that the trial will accumulate 50 events between December 12th and December 20th.**\n\nI think this is reasonable, however I don't have a statistics degree and am open feedback assuming anyone actually read all of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion and Final Predictions\n\nWe can debate NVAX\u2019s management team and ability to deliver on manufacturing output, booster revenue, and a whole bunch of other things I addressed in previous posts but I\u2019ll spare you bc none of it matters for what happens in the next 2-4 weeks.\n\nThe success of this trade will be based on 1) whether or not they announce positive interim results and 2) the timing of the announcement. If results are positive and they're announced in the ballpark of my estimated timeframe, then it could be an easy 500% return depending on the contracts you buy.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be shocked if the stock dips a few more times prior to announcement in response to Pfizer/Moderna news, but I think we\u2019re close to the bottom. I\u2019m not comfortable missing an announcement so I\u2019m not gonna bother trying to time it perfectly but keep that in mind.\n\nI\u2019ve settled in on a strategy of buying a few grand worth of OTM weeklies while building a core position of January 15th options on dips. Overall options volume isn\u2019t great so I\u2019ve been picking my strikes based on volume and have a ton of Jan 15 150c and 160c. See previous posts for proof.\n\nIf your risk tolerance isn\u2019t high then regular shares aren\u2019t a bad move because this is gonna move enough to still make good return and there\u2019s potential for big swings until an announcement is made.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final Predictions**\n\n\u00b7 Announcement of initiation of Phase 3 US trial between 11Dec and 18Dec\n\n\u00b7 50 events recorded achieved between December 12-20; press release within 7 days of events being achieved (December 19-27)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\nUpdate\n\nRegarding options prices, consider the price history of the Jan 15 150c:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ekfwggromh461.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=70a89f8e974e0ebbcee444ded22c6e8fbe3fb942\n\nThat was due to a jump from $100/share to a high of $145/share. Interim announcement sends this much higher than $145/share.\n\n&#x200B;", "author_fullname": "t2_5an67207", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Final update and predictions for $NVAX: time is running out to get in before take off", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"h5mciai07h461": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 120, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/h5mciai07h461.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=140d43a9b53ee0a3d002111ad65b6711f80f6d64"}, {"y": 240, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/h5mciai07h461.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0a121b3ab941d53774429127fb2eb7090733283f"}, {"y": 355, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/h5mciai07h461.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ec02ec8c9d906e1af49ae515aa2c673dc85efcb6"}], "s": {"y": 515, "x": 463, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/h5mciai07h461.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed9031712307e8052df3559e45397c313f47fc22"}, "id": "h5mciai07h461"}, "eplpltd17h461": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 93, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eplpltd17h461.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4f39b0ff665e720c4a31829d82cc55d28f4ad32d"}, {"y": 186, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eplpltd17h461.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5d778c980d043e10dee79322820ddfe21659f546"}, {"y": 276, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eplpltd17h461.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e35779c8fd7d60959a9c7f7d7bac73ca99033627"}], "s": {"y": 539, "x": 624, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eplpltd17h461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e1c1bbb6940c5b65db7145c7cf4e236769548b4"}, "id": "eplpltd17h461"}, "3cmnb8pz6h461": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 89, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3cmnb8pz6h461.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=34f1059b7f40a047a4e1d9f97df1b9ecc3b9477b"}, {"y": 178, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3cmnb8pz6h461.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4ae73dae2c2ba5c7d27a216df3c27e0ee9628f1e"}, {"y": 264, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3cmnb8pz6h461.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e8100faac62ad5abd41cdda27e92d2b5d1532a7c"}], "s": {"y": 517, "x": 625, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3cmnb8pz6h461.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ccfa13f90793285b382d0f2ebeb3f9134e41654"}, "id": "3cmnb8pz6h461"}, "ekfwggromh461": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 110, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ekfwggromh461.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d5dd388a842b1ad6c171bb5d3910127325849661"}, {"y": 221, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ekfwggromh461.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9afb36a7450216d48157d33ed7ce0fbed690395f"}, {"y": 328, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ekfwggromh461.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5faad78264e6c769361cd4b66361ecd9146dde12"}, {"y": 657, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ekfwggromh461.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6d1a42bb58f35816de8eb6ecb37420f14d4f224a"}], "s": {"y": 822, "x": 800, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ekfwggromh461.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=70a89f8e974e0ebbcee444ded22c6e8fbe3fb942"}, "id": "ekfwggromh461"}}, "name": "t3_kaulkc", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 60, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": true, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 60, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/0NaidJlASRqF-WCUjiTyQWCf9_AyBDv6-1j7_-nZXks.jpg", "edited": 1607662020.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1607685659.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I continue to get questions about NVAX and decided to make one final post for current and prospective NVAX holders.

I\u2019m ok with these factors being too conservative since the linear enrollment assumption is almost certainly too optimistic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>With those caveats, my model estimates that the trial will accumulate 50 events between December 12th and December 20th.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think this is reasonable, however I don&#39;t have a statistics degree and am open feedback assuming anyone actually read all of this.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion and Final Predictions</h1>\n\n<p>We can debate NVAX\u2019s management team and ability to deliver on manufacturing output, booster revenue, and a whole bunch of other things I addressed in previous posts but I\u2019ll spare you bc none of it matters for what happens in the next 2-4 weeks.</p>\n\n<p>The success of this trade will be based on 1) whether or not they announce positive interim results and 2) the timing of the announcement. If results are positive and they&#39;re announced in the ballpark of my estimated timeframe, then it could be an easy 500% return depending on the contracts you buy.</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if the stock dips a few more times prior to announcement in response to Pfizer/Moderna news, but I think we\u2019re close to the bottom. I\u2019m not comfortable missing an announcement so I\u2019m not gonna bother trying to time it perfectly but keep that in mind.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve settled in on a strategy of buying a few grand worth of OTM weeklies while building a core position of January 15th options on dips. Overall options volume isn\u2019t great so I\u2019ve been picking my strikes based on volume and have a ton of Jan 15 150c and 160c. See previous posts for proof.</p>\n\n<p>If your risk tolerance isn\u2019t high then regular shares aren\u2019t a bad move because this is gonna move enough to still make good return and there\u2019s potential for big swings until an announcement is made.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final Predictions</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u00b7 Announcement of initiation of Phase 3 US trial between 11Dec and 18Dec</p>\n\n<p>\u00b7 50 events recorded achieved between December 12-20; press release within 7 days of events being achieved (December 19-27)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>----------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>Update</p>\n\n<p>Regarding options prices, consider the price history of the Jan 15 150c:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ekfwggromh461.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70a89f8e974e0ebbcee444ded22c6e8fbe3fb942\">https://preview.redd.it/ekfwggromh461.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70a89f8e974e0ebbcee444ded22c6e8fbe3fb942</a></p>\n\n<p>That was due to a jump from $100/share to a high of $145/share. Interim announcement sends this much higher than $145/share.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null,
