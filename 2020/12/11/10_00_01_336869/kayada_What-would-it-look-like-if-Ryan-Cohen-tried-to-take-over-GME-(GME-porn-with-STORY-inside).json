{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Been running through this thought experiment wondering what to look out for if Ryan Cohen ever tries to take over GME because I think it will be very fortuitous to whoever realizes it's happening while it's happening. I also enjoy my GME porn to have a good story to it and I think I've crafted an enjoyable scene here\n\nIf I was Ryan Cohen, which tahnkfully for all of u I'm not because I'd burn this company to the ground faster than General Sherman, the last step to me trying to take over would be gobbling as many voting shares as I can. He's worth 600 mil, presumably not all liquid, but he also stopped right at 9.9% ownership because he's leaving the option open of going over 10% (or at least the impression of it). If he ticks over 10% he has 10 days to report and file. What I would do if I were him is I would plan my 10 days of purchases around earnings because that's when volume is the highest. Not only that, but that is when call option liquidity is the highest. There is 5 million worth of shares (50k call contracts) from current price to 20 strike expiring tm. There is 3 million worth of shares (30k contracts) expiring next week. He's not gonna be able to buy that many of the calls without giving away his move but again what I would do is buy as many of those as I could before I fire my final bullet to buy as much of GME as I can. Then, if I drive the price of GME over the strikes of calls that I own that works out because I'll just exercise and own even more GME. Again it's well over 10% of the float that is in calls expiring in the next 6 days up to the 20 stirke, idk how much of that he can buy without showing his hand but it's definitely going to be a helpful amount of voting power if he's really trying to pull off this take over.\n\nLooked up what 10 days before tomorrow looked like, it was the Friday before the Monday that we gapped up 20% so there was definitely a lot of buying pressure there. GME is on, maybe. Lots of volume thru earnings as expected. Shorts definitely came through as we can see with the borrow rate spiking, price dropped 20% but I've seen intraday swings of 20% with what looked like less shorting pressure..is there buying pressure?\n\nIf I'm a speculator looking for a Ryan Cohen take over, I'm going to pay careful attention to the price action tomorrow morning. If I see a lot of early volume in the calls and then buying in the morning (buying has to start in the morning IMO coz that's when volume is highest and heavy buying can be a little more hidden) then the play is to yeet a bullet into way OTM calls expiring tm and then just fucking hold thru EOD if the trade is working in my favor.
