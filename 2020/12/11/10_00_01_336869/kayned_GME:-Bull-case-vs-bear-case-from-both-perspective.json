Because the most lucrative part of GME's business is buying and selling old games. So this will ultimately die.\n\nPlus, game related merchandize and other products(which are very lucrative and a huge market) would still remain under the clout of Amazon, Walmart etc, so GME will not be able to survive through that business model.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe next two or three quarters are pivotal for GME.\n\n    If\n    \"Management decides to address Cohen's concerns and manages to show their roadmap to success and improves its financials within the next two quarters = Short squeeze\"\n    \n    Else If\n    \"Cohen declares hostile takeover or something close to that line= Short squeeze\"\n    \n    Else If\n    \"Management addresses Cohen but fails to deliver within the next two quarters and has disappointing earnings=Unsure\" #improbable cause next two quarters are expected to be good or at least the guidance which is more important\n    \n    Else If\n    \"Management doesn't fully address Cohen's concern, Cohen also doesn't make any move yet the business improves still= Likely short squeeze\"\n    \n    Else If\n    \"Management fails to address Cohen's concern, Cohen disassociates himself, business fundamentals detoriorate= Retail bagholders\"\n    \n    Else\n    \"I don't know really, imagine your own scenario, you are not bound to my conclusions.
