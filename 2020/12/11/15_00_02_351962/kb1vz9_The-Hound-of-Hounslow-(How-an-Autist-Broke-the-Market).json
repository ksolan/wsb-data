In what would later be dubbed \u201cThe Crash of 2:45\u201d or simply \u201cThe Flash Crash,\u201d over a trillion dollars was wiped from the stock market in a manner of 15 minutes. The odd thing was, despite dropping more than 9% at one point, the market would rapidly recover a bit after 3 PM and would close only 3% lower for the day.\n\nIn the ensuing days and weeks, journalists and financial commentators and United States Congressmen would try and determine where this volatility had come from.

Was this a well-coordinated cyberattack, aimed to cripple American institutions? Was it simply a dip exacerbated by high-frequency traders? Had Janet Yellen forgotten to change the printer toner?\n\nNobody knew. But five months after the flash crash, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) released a joint report that on May 6, 2010 the market was \u201cso fragmented and fragile that a single large trade could send stocks into a sudden spiral.\u201d They stated that a group called Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. had inadvertently played a role in the crash by initiating a sale of 75,000 E-Mini S&P contracts ($4.1 billion total) as a hedge to an existing position. This, the report said, coupled with the high-frequency traders trying to sell the long futures contracts they had just picked up from Waddell & Reed, led to a game of \u201chot potato\u201d where the contracts were resold to other HFTs.\n\nThe report though was leaving out a crucial player.\n\n\\#\n\nIn 2005, Navinder Sarao was living the dream. At 27 years old, he still lived with his parents in Hounslow, a working-class suburb outside of London, demanding tendies to be delivered to his bedroom by his sweet emigrant mother. To the people who knew him, Navinder, or Nav, was known to be quick-witted and quick to anger. He was dominant at Halo and FIFA, and he had a proclivity to focus on one task for hours and hours on end until he mastered it. He was almost obsessive in his interests.\n\nDespite still living with his parents, young Nav had aspirations. In 2006, he responded to an ad in the Evening Standard that read, \u201cWanted: futures traders. Must work well under pressure.\u201d That\u2019s it. That was the ad. And Nav, with no experience and a honey mustard-stained tie, went to the FutexLive headquarters\u2014a drab office situated above a supermarket 45 minutes outside London\u2014and successfully hid his Asperger\u2019s and got the job. He was now a professional trader.\n\nNav picked things up quickly. Realizing that he was surrounded by day-trading retards, he moved his desk to the corner of the shabby trading floor and bought a pair of noise-canceling headphones. He\u2019d found success trading E-mini S&P Futures, which is the primary futures trading vehicle for the S&P 500. And with his noise-canceling headphones, Nav would follow the orders that would enter and leave the markets. His coworkers would marvel at the autist in the corner and the returns he was regularly pulling in.\n\nThen 2008 happened. By the time the financial crisis was in full swing, Nav was almost thirty and had decided to leave Futex. He had accumulated $2 million from his trades the last couple of years, and he figured the most prudent move as a budding millionaire was to set up his command center in his bedroom. He still lived with his parents.\n\n\\#\n\nNav realized something early on in the mortgage crisis that not everyone else did. He realized that governments would be forced to step in and save these retarded institutions, and he knew the banks wouldn\u2019t be allowed to fall. And he bet $2 million\u2014his whole net worth at the time\u2014that he would be right. He made this bet on a Friday, and the following Monday, George Bush announced the TARP plan.\n\nPrices proceeded to recover 19% over the next couple of weeks, and Nav rode the wave and turned his $2 million into $15 million. Did he rest on his laurels? Fuck no, this kid\u2019s retarded! Nav didn\u2019t want a wife and a home with a couple of kids running around. He wanted GLORY.\n\n\\#\n\nAround 2010, the markets were seeing an influx in high-frequency trading, and Nav took personal insult to these robots. People were getting scalped by these algos, and those scalps belonged to Nav. Those profits were rightfully his.\n\nIn order to beat the robots, Nav decided to build his own robot. And unsurprisingly, fueled by Code Red and autism, Nav\u2019s algo worked magnificently. Pretty soon, he was regularly pulling in half a million a day. All the while living in a cramped bedroom of his parents\u2019 home that cost $300,000.\n\n\\#\n\nMay 6, 2010, started out as a regular day for Nav. The markets were sliding a bit, and Jim Cramer was flailing about his studio as though he were fighting a cloud of bats, but this was roughly on par for the time. Nav\u2019s algo was pumping E-mini sell orders into the market\u2014$200 million worth of orders to be exact\u2014which ultimately resulted in a loss of liquidity (don\u2019t ask me how this worked, I\u2019m still confused why my PLTR 12/11 40C aren\u2019t printing). At around 1:40 EST, or 6:40 in Hounslow, his mother called from the bottom of the steps to inform Nav that din-din was ready and would he please come down. \n\nSo Nav logged off.\n\nAnd exactly one minute after that, the market began to fall at a rate that had never seen before. Nav had no idea though; he was in an argument with his father about why he needed to chew with his mouth open in order to let the scalding tendy fumes out. A trillion dollars had been wiped from American markets, and the instigator of it all was too retarded to know what he\u2019d done. \n\nThe tendies were good though.\n\n\\#\n\nThe trillion-dollar loss turned out to be not that big of a deal. The DOW snapped back from the 9% freefall like a rubber band, like any stock that Andrew Left has deemed to be a casino. But the NYSE and NASDAQ officials proceeded to meet over the next couple of months to try and determine what caused the nosedive and rapid recovery. In the reports that they would write, regulators made no reference to manipulation and no reference to Nav. In fact, he wasn\u2019t even aware there was an investigation going on. He wasn\u2019t aware he did anything wrong.\n\nBut regulators eventually began to notice that Nav was canceling a lot of orders. The CFTC sent him an email and asked if he could explain what he\u2019d been up to. What was the reason for his canceling an obscene number of orders? That\u2019s what big banks did. And that\u2019d usually be fine and all, but Nav was a singular trader and that made it suspicious. \n\nNav wrote back to the CFTC explaining in careful terms that he had nothing to apologize for and that the CFTC could kiss his ass. He actually sent that. He told the CFTC to kiss his ass. Which, in hindsight, might\u2019ve been a bad idea but the regulators were still too stupid and boomery to charge him with anything at the time. Nav would\u2019ve gotten away with it too if it weren\u2019t for a blabbermouth desk trader in Chicago who months later reported a different block of Nav\u2019s trades to the CFTC, rekindling the case against Nav.\n\nThe investigation and case were dragged out over months and years, and I know 99% of you were too impatient to get this far, so I\u2019ll give the cliff notes for the rest. Basically, Nav would eventually be charged with \u201cspoofing,\u201d which is the purchase of a large block of orders with the intent to cancel them. Spoofing artificially drives prices higher or lower. So the FBI and other concerned parties showed up on the doorstep of Nav\u2019s Hounslow townhome in 2015, and he was extradited to the U.S. The judge learned he was worth $50 million, so he set bail to $7.5 million. Curiously enough though, Nav couldn\u2019t access the $50 million or pay bail, and it was later determined that he\u2019d somehow lost the fortune, seemingly to various shady investment advisors who promised to keep his money safe. (I personally like to think he\u2019s stashed his earnings into a Caribbean account and that he\u2019ll return to his private island once things blow over)\n\nOver the next couple of months, Nav worked with investigators and taught them how market abuse happens. He was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s by a prison doctor, and the judge, sensing the moral dilemma of incarcerating an autist, and sensing Nav had received punishment enough from being scammed out of his $50 million, recommended a year of house arrest. \n\nSo Nav is currently serving his year of house arrest in the same bedroom where he amassed $50 million. But now he\u2019s penniless at 41. \n\nTLDR: Some autist beats the system, but the casino is angry and creates new rules to retroactively punish him for his winnings.", "author_fullname": "t2_1pjcxy", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Hound of Hounslow (How an Autist Broke the Market)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Storytime"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "storytime", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kb1vz9", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 144, "total_awards_received": 5, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Storytime", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 144, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 1}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1607718658.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>On May 6, 2010, Jim Cramer\u2019s brain broke. \u201cThat is not a real price,\u201d he yelled to his monitor. \u201cOK?

But now he\u2019s penniless at 41. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Some autist beats the system, but the casino is angry and creates new rules to retroactively punish him for his winnings.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "coin_price": 30, "id": "award_a2506925-fc82-4d6c-ae3b-b7217e09d7f0", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "PREMIUM", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png", "days_of_premium": 0, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=16&height=16&auto=webp&s=4e475e8c3265ec7148d7f4204f07d33949482f21", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=32&height=32&auto=webp&s=42e32a4b9f1e70791716c3be283e89951e212a69", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=48&height=48&auto=webp&s=5adb621fede4e8e66b952a379ad038fcc1b8ad13", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=64&height=64&auto=webp&s=6161edea19569bbee73ef322a2e5470535ec1787", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=128&height=128&auto=webp&s=5d2c75f44f176f430e936204f9a53b8a2957f2fc", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "A golden splash of respect", "end_date": null, "subreddit_coin_reward": 0, "count": 1, "static_icon_height": 2048, "name": "Narwhal Salute", "resized_static_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=16&height=16&auto=webp&s=4e475e8c3265ec7148d7f4204f07d33949482f21", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=32&height=32&auto=webp&s=42e32a4b9f1e70791716c3be283e89951e212a69", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=48&height=48&auto=webp&s=5adb621fede4e8e66b952a379ad038fcc1b8ad13", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=64&height=64&auto=webp&s=6161edea19569bbee73ef322a2e5470535ec1787", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=128&height=128&auto=webp&s=5d2c75f44f176f430e936204f9a53b8a2957f2fc", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_format": null, "icon_height": 2048, "penny_price": null, "award_type": "global", "static_icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png"}, {"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "coin_price": 250, "id": "award_a67d649d-5aa5-407e-a98b-32fd9e3a9696", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "APPRECIATION", "coin_reward": 100, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/bph2png4ajz31_TodayILearned.png", "days_of_premium": 0, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/bph2png4ajz31_TodayILearned.png?width=16&height=16&auto=webp&s=bbfa251092cce139b37d74237ec28a8c4e8f06b0", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/bph2png4ajz31_TodayILearned.png?width=32&height=32&auto=webp&s=e1f9dd28741e2551b1fbbd341b006cc316f48fa1", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/bph2png4ajz31_TodayILearned.png?width=48&height=48&auto=webp&s=d93434d26563a534397ff748cce71d4b733c32d9", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/bph2png4ajz31_TodayILearned.png?width=64&height=64&auto=webp&s=cf4a1ddb8474d11682f0d88aa32562f9fcbf30b0", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/bph2png4ajz31_TodayILearned.png?width=128&height=128&auto=webp&s=70b1596cdd0ae75b52db5c2732d8c336d300cc11", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "The more you know...
