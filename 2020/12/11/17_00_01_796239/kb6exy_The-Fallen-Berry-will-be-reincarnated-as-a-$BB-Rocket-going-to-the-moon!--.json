Black Berry has reinvented it self as an IT company in 2014 after John Chen became CEO. It now leads in the cybersecurity industry with contracts signed with 19 out of the 20 G20 countries.

What we care about is the EV(EV stands for electrical vehicle you retard) industry which **WE** Blasted into Saturn this year.\n\nThe Black Berry QNX software is in 175 million vehicles. In addition, BlackBerry just announced that it partnered with **Amazon** to create Black Berry IVY which is a software which will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights  from that data that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles. **Blah Blah Blah,** why would I care?
