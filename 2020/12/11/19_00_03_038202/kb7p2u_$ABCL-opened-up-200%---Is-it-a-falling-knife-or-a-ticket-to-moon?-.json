Drugs discovery usually takes 5 to 15 years with less than 5% success rate and cost billions of dollars to find approved molecules. Abcellera provides the teams and technologies that work broadly with the biotech industries to put the best science and best innovator in touch with the best technology to get faster drugs to patients.** Abcellera essentially **solves the two fundamental problems that hinder the discovery and the development of next generation antibody- based therapeutics. The first is the technology: because of the limitations of legacy discovery approaches, there are many well validated targets for which suitable antibodies cannot be found. The second is access: most companies are forced to cobble together fragmented solutions and lack the facilities and expertise needed to prosecute their antibody programs. Both problems contribute to the rising cost of drug development and delay brining needed therapies to patients.** With the leverage of Abcellera\u2019s technology, Eli Lily was able to put out COVID-19 antibody cocktail to trials within a record-breaking speed of just 3 months. Abcellera was able screen through 5.5mil + immune cells to see which makes antibodies on Day 4, find 2K+ potential antibodies that could stick to the virus surface on Day 6, sequence through DNA of 500+ antibodies that could stick to virus spike protein on Day 9, select 190 most promising antibodies for potency testing on Day 17, and finally select 24 antibody front runners for Eli Lily to further develop them into antibody cocktail. Within the past 3 years, **Abcellera has already accrued more than 40 deals, engaged in 94 discovery programs, and under contracted with 26 partners.** **With validation from the partnerships with major biotech firms, it signifies the effectiveness and the reliability of the platform setting Abcellera up for a more lucrative terms and deals in the future.** Through the partnership agreements, Abcellera **will collect near-term payment for technology access, research and intellectual property right, and downstream payments in form of clinical and commercial milestones and royalties on net sales.
