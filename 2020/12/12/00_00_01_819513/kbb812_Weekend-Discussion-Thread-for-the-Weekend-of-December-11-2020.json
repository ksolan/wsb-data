On a related another note, the Senate also passed a veto proof defense $740 bil even though POTUS is against this bill as it doesn't repeal liability protection for big tech (who is part of the deep state against him).\n\n* DIS makes a return to WSB land as the big mouse is now big tech. Sub count for DIS+ is projected to fly to 230 to 260 mil subscribers by 2024. With a smattering of new Star Wars and Marvel series announced last night, intraday high for DIS shares went as lofty as $179.46, almost up 16%. Shares closed the day at $175.72, up 13.59%. Meanwhile I've since long sold my Jan '21 155c and 166c for a modest lost back in August.

PFE shares are down 1.45% cuz boomer stock is boomer. While vax news are likely priced in for now, if you want to play vaccine, ditch PFE which probably won't have material impact from Covid distribution and the better plays would be BNTX and/or MRNA.\n\n* FB antitrust case is moving along, the case has been assigned to two judges appointed by Obama.

Citi analysts says its NBD, and we all know to trust these sell-side analysts, right?\n\n* Gene editing stocks made a pull back today after mooning to the stratosphere yesterday thanks to positive progress announced earlier this week. SGMO pulled back 21% while EDIT is down about 7%. If you haven't heard of these stocks yet, they will be meme material soon enough.\n\n* Shares of Chinese EV ADR/ADS are down sharply today with NIO leading a more than -7% drill, as the Chinese company initiated an offering with 60 mil worth of stock due to skyrocketing valuation. Unlike TSLA, the market isn't impressed as there are only so many shares of these Cayman Island holding companies that they can China Hustle into.\n\n* After being down more than 1.1% in intraday trade, QQQ and big tech made a reversal after lunch as MMs return to their desk from their coke binge and bought the dip. Dow closed the day up 0.16%, SPX closed at 0.13% and IXIC (that's Nasdaq for you retards) closed at 0.23%.\n\n* As the weekend settles in, WSB readies itself to hibernate and complain about how the market isn't open during the weekend while preparing themselves to talk incessantly about futures when it opens on Sunday night - even though 99% of us don't have the balls to toss money into these derivatives.", "edited": 1607720917.0, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Reeeeeeeeecap of today&#39;s market driving news:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The US Senate passed the one-week govt funding extension, bringing the bill to POTUS&#39;s bigly desk.
