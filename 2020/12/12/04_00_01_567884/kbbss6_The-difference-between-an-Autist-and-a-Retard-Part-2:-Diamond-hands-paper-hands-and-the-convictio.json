{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Last Friday, [I posted a little spiel](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6onxs/the_difference_between_an_autist_and_a_retard/) where I tried to pinpoint the difference between two different types of WSB users: autists and retards. It received a modest number of upvotes and a \"rocket like award,\" but that's not the real reason I'm posting a follow-up. You see, I don't think I got it quite right. \n\nMy argument last week was basically twofold: first, autists base their plays upon a coherent thesis, whereas retards don't. Second, autists form their thesis before the run, while retards wait for confirmation bias to kick in. While I still agree with both of those points, I think there's actually a simpler way to put it: autists have conviction in their plays, and retards don't. \n\nYou might object: what about the retards who diamond-hand wildly OTM options until they expire worthless? Don't they have conviction, albeit of the retarded variety? To which I would respond: retard conviction is not real conviction. It's just a potent example of the [sunk cost fallacy](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/the-sunk-cost-fallacy/). Confirmation bias, a.k.a. \"meme power\" or \"retard strength\" is what leads retards to enter postitions and stay with them when they're winning, and the sunk cost fallacy is what leads retards to stick with losing positions.  Needless to say, the conviction of an autist is different.\n\nAn autist's conviction starts with thorough DD. That's an acronym for \"due dilligence\"--fellow retards take note. Someone else's DD can be a great starting point, but it's essential to actually understand the points that they raise. For your trades to be successful longer-term, you need to internalize the bull (or bear) case for a particular stock as conviction. This is what autists do. \n\nI'm using the term \"autist\" here loosely, of course, in a manner particular to WSB. Real-life autists tend to be rigid and inflexible once they adopt a particular position, but that inflexibility is the enemy. This is a dance; I didn't say it would be easy. \n\nPart of the way you stay flexible and supple is by exploring counterarguments. In the context of WSB, look for posts that have been downvoted to oblivion, and let yourself play devil's advocate for a moment. I often find myself getting caught up in the hype of some particularly sexy DD but then find that confidence crumbling the moment someone brings up something contrary. I then recognize that I hadn't actually bought into the bull case after all, I've simply accepted someone else's authority as fact. Pay attention to that. \n\nReal conviction means having enough self-confidence to remain open to contradictory data points. It's like life. When contradictory data emerges, you can weigh it against your overall thesis. If the thesis no longer holds, you can close your positions or scale them back without being attached to them emotionally. Retards do not have this capacity. They enter positions for emotional reasons, and they leave them for emotional reasons. That is the enemy. Emotional conviction is retarte conviction. Autists play differently. \n\nWe've mostly talked about the dangers of diamond-handing, but let's discuss the opposite side of the coin: paper hands. Autistic conviction, as opposed to retarted conviction, is the capacity to hold to a position *when data emerges that looks bad on paper but does not invalidate the autist's central thesis.* This is important. Stonks go up, they go down, they go sideways. All kinds of factors affect this day-to-day action, and 90% of them are irrelevant to an autist's thesis. This is where the conventional usage of  \"autist\" is actually appropriate. Autists have a unique capacity to filter out the noise. It's actually too effective. Again, the WSB autist's ability to remain open to *meaningful* noise is what sets him (or her!) apart. \n\nThe result is that the autist, like Buddha, courses the Middle Way between diamond hands and paper hands, falling into neither extreme. Retards diamond hand and paper hand all the time, and they do both for the same reason: lacking deeper wisdom, they base their decisions upon emotional attachment. \n\nAs Buddha taught, that is the root of suffering. Where the stock market diverges from the immutable law of Dharma is that sometimes stupid decisions can have positive results. Diamond handing weeklies can lead to big gains when a stock skyrockets close to expiration. There are innumerable examples, well documented on these forums. But they are outliers. Your retardation will fuck you over, just as it has fucked me over. Today's 5000% gains can be tomorrow's crushing losses when you apply the same retarted logic to your next play. \n\nYou've been warned, and you've probably got more than you bargained for. Peace out, WSB, and please trade responsibly.\n\nTL;DR: Autists win because their \"diamond handing\" or \"paper handing\" is rational; retards lose because it isn't.", "author_fullname": "t2_8mf7v8pa", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The difference between an Autist and a Retard, Part 2: Diamond hands, paper hands, and the conviction of an Autist", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Storytime"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "storytime", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kbbss6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 43, "total_awards_received": 3, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Storytime", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 43, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1607751057.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Last Friday, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6onxs/the_difference_between_an_autist_and_a_retard/\">I posted a little spiel</a> where I tried to pinpoint the difference between two different types of WSB users: autists and retards.
