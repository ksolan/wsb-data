{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**CRSR -** Corsair Gaming should be looked at again for WSB's next big play. WSB was high on CRSR after earnings and hit a ATH high of $51.37 earlier last month and is currently trading 35% below its ATH. With the success WSB has had on bringing in retail investors and media recognition, CRSR could easily double from current levels. Let me break out why\n\n**IPO and history:** CRSR ipo'ed back in August 21, 2020. Selling 14 million shares to investors/retail (This float will be important later on) at a price of $17. The stock traded mostly sideways until its first earning report where it blew out estimates on November 10th and rallied from $27 to $51 in a 14 day span.\n\n**Revenue Growth:** CRSR has been growing revenues rapidly year over year, with 17% growth from 2018 (937M) to 2019 (1.1B). CRSR is on track for its best year yet with revenues YTD 9 months of 1.1B and Q4 earnings coming up expecting revenues in the $450m+ (low on guidance, I expected $600m+) range due to the Christmas sales bump/blackfriday/cyber moday. Representing 55% revenue growth from prior year and drastically exceeding its computer accessory peers. (LOGI 11% 2019 growth and 6.3% 2020 revenue growth) This factor alone should pay dues in its upcoming earnings  come February 2021.\n\n**Valuation to competitors:**\n\nLOGI: 15B market cap - 3B annual sales (6.3% annual growth) Price to sales: 5.06\n\nCRSR: 3B market cap - 1.66B+ annual sales (51% annual growth) Price to sales 1.91 \n\n(severely undervalued) PT of  $65 would still put this at under half of LOGI's Market Cap which would be reasonable considering CRSR's revenue growth rate.\n\n**Inventory:** CRSR has expanded its production facilities over the past year and began to stock pile inventory for the upcoming increase in demand during holiday season (christmas, black friday, cyber monday). Inventory levels of 210m Sept 2020 vs 144M June 2020. All old inventory on the books went on fire sale and were on the top deals pages for slick deals/walmart/amazon. With prices slashed up to 50% off these items were quick to sell out and these sales will be reflected in the upcoming earnings call. Guidance was forecasted at 450M for upcoming quarter, which is on the safe side and inline with their Q3 earnings but I expect it to blow these estimates out of the water and coming in at the 600M+ range which would be inline with their quarterly sales growth excluding holiday sales bump (generally a 15% increase in sales from Q3.\n\n**Margin Growth and turning a profit**: CRSR has been implementing economies of scale and recent revenue growth to begin to turn a profit. CRSR has gone net income in Dec 2019 of 6m to 36m as of September 2020.\n\n**Balance sheet:** CRSR has a strong balance sheet with no red flags. Consistent increasing cash positions, Strong working capital, Increased inventory levels for the holiday season rush and minimal debt. The IPO raised238 million dollars from the proceeds and was directly applied toward their debt. Reducing it from 500m to 370m. Which should be paid off by the end of 2022. They are cashflow positive and will no longer need any cash injections/share offerings in the future.\n\n**Recent Sell off:**\n\nTaking profits: People who rode the stock up from earnings from $27 bucks to $51 taking profits and investing in other hot sectors EV/SPAC/IPOs. The dry up on volume has resulted in this stock heavily following the SPY.\n\nAnalyst Downgrade: Cowen & Co downgraded the stock with a price target of $37 causing it to drop 15% early last week, stating the risk is to high with its recent run up and is overvalued compared to LOGI. (see analysis above, on a price to sales where CRSR is currently trading at below 2 P/S compared to LOGI at above 5 P/S\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FLOAT!!!!!!!:** The main reason this should be WSB's next play is its tiny float. Of the total 91.92m shares outstanding only 17.79M represent the public float which was offered during their IPO. The remainder of the float is still locked up until February 22,2021.\n\nOf this 17.79m Float institutions own 14.47m (all purchased between October 19th to November 27th)\n\nSome key holders include -\n\nBlackRock: 2.16m shares\n\nJP Morgan : 1.96m shares\n\nMassachusetts financial : 1.55m shares\n\nCitadel advisors : 1.9m shares\n\nJPM small growth : 1.27m shares\n\nFMR: 1.06m shares\n\nThe remaining public float is sitting at **3.32 million shares for a 3 billion dollar company**.  This stock can be manipulated and pumped by our autistic forces easily. Which is one of the reasons why this stock ran to $50 bucks on minimal volume. (this was before institutions loaded up, will be even easier to pump a second time around)\n\nFloats previous pumps:\n\nNIO: 177 Million\n\nPLTR: 1060 Million\n\nHCAC: 30 Million\n\nCRSR: 3.3 Million (TO THE MOON)\n\n**Short interest:** 1.6 million shares are currently shorted (50% of the active float), these shorts will have to call at the first sign of another run up, sending this to the moon.\n\n**Bid/Ask spreads:** the daily spread on this stock is alone is anywhere from .7% to 1.2% which further proves how tight of a float we have here. Once we get our autists to slap the ask we will see this thing pump 15-20% days.\n\n**TLDR: CRSR is generating record revenue growth and undervalued to its peers (LOGI), has a strong balance sheet and to kick it off has a public traded float of 3.3m which will send this stock flying the moment we get behind it. Calls are relatively cheap due to recent sell off and volume drying up. Best case we send this back to ATH's where it should be, worst case you have money invested in a undervalued company that will crush earnings come early February.**", "author_fullname": "t2_iqja2", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "CRSR - WSB's Next Millionaire Maker Big play", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_kbp0eu", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 58, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 58, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1607782643.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1607808091.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>CRSR -</strong> Corsair Gaming should be looked at again for WSB&#39;s next big play.
