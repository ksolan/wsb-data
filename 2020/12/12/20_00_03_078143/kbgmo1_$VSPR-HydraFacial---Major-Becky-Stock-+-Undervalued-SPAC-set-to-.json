{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": " ***My position: 25,000 warrants at $2/share - $50,000 bet***\n\nAlright fellow tards listen up. $VSPR is a SPAC that has officially announced a merger with Hydrafacial. I know what you're going to say: \u201ctHiS iS a gIrL sToCk\u201d or \u201cwHaT aBoUt PLTR aNd GME?!\u201d\n\nWell...go talk to your girlfriends or mommys or the insta model you whack it to about HydraFacial. I'm here to make big money. This is a prime Becky stock ready to moon once you and the fellow bros on Wall Street figure it out. While we've all been playing with ourselves buying GME, Becky stocks like $ALGN, $LULU, $PTON, and $ULTA have crushed it this year. Women spend tons of money on health, wellness, and beauty, and this one is massively underpriced compared to those ones.\n\n**What is VSPR and HydraFacial?**\n\n[Here is a link to their investor presentation](https://2y7msb2elfoj22q7jr2xnc83-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Project-Hydrate-Investor-Presentation_vFinal.pdf)\n\nLong story short, HydraFacial is a new and more natural alternative to Botox. It's a natural skincare product where salons will treat customers skin with serums that will clean, extract, and hydrate skin to make it look younger, reduce wrinkles, and give skin a \"glow\". Look up reviews for it...Google, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter...all are great feedback. 99% \"worth it\" rating on RealSelf.\n\nVSPR is a $460M SPAC led by Allergan CEO and Jim Cramer butt-buddy and Brent Saunders. Saunders did a great job as CEO of Allergan and grew the business through making great acquisitions. He has been in the cosmetic industry for decades and he knows his shit, certainly wouldn\u2019t have picked HydraFacial unless the product was legit. He and Cramer are legitimately best buds...you'll want to get in before the inevitable Cramer pump. They are forking over $460M and leading a $350M PIPE to buy HydraFacial at a $1.1B valuation.\n\n**Financials**\n\nHydraFacial makes money selling both the dispensers for the system which lasts 7 years and makes up 49% of revenue, and the other 51% of revenue is the single-use serums.\n\nIn 2019 they were at $167M of revenue with 52% CAGR, and $41M EBITDA with 38% CAGR. Margins are around 20%-25%. They're targeting $250M in rev in 2022. This deal will give them an extra $100M of cash on the balance sheet and get their debt down to $0. That's right, **this is a profitable SPAC with $0 in debt**\n\n**Growth Opportunity**\n\nThis thing is primed for growth in the next 5-10 years. They're already growing at over 50% YOY and were able to have record deliveries even in the middle of COVID when a lot of salons were closed.\n\nThey don't just have market share...they ARE the market. They have created this category in the beauty industry. They are the \"Kleenex\" of this industry; HydraFacial is now both their brand and synonymous for the process of hydrating facial treatment. They have 38 patents on their products so that they will continue to corner this market as it grows.\n\nThe youngins fucking love this treatment. They have a massive social media presence (\\~$2.3B media impressions, 16% instagram engagement rate). About 50%-60% of their users are millennials, and the average user gets 4 treatments per year. Just like botox, this is a recurring treatment with recurring revenue for HydraFacial. As influencers and social media keeps making us look at ourselves in a camera...these products are going to be needed.\n\nOh yeah, did I mention they're in 87 counties?! Their biggest market is the US, but they are predicting a much larger and faster growth in the Asia market.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nThis deal sits them at *$1.1B, about 4.6x 2022 revenue*. Yeah that's high, but so is this goddamn market. Shit, Nikola pushed a truck down a hill and QS hasn't built a goddamn thing yet and they're worth billions. This market wants future growth, and this company has plenty it.\n\nIt's hard to get an exact comparable valuation since they are a new player in a new market. If we're going with the Becky market they are massively undervalued compared to their peers and they have better growth:\n\n(Align 9.0x rev, LULU 6.9X rev, L' Oreal 5.3x rev, Estee Lauder 5.2x rev).\n\nI own a large amount of $ALGN which popped over 100% just because some TikTokers use their product. LULU and PTON...huge becky stocks that are crushed during the pandemic. This is all the new rage with the younger female generation and this is the ALGN of skincare.\n\n**What's the play?**\n\nFuck can't believe you read this far. This is a SPAC. SPAC market has been retarded lately, nothing but moons. Wall Street hasn't caught up to this one yet because its not an EV SPAC. If you don't know how SPACs work...learn how to Google things, but essentially they all start at $10/share and have a $10 floor. That's right, you CAN'T GO BELOW $10. This offers an insanely low risk for a SPAC that is going to take off.\n\nThe stock (or \"commons\") are trading at $10.65...offering a very low downside. Even better, the warrants (essentially a call option for SPACs) are trading at $2 which is stupid cheap for a SPAC that's announced a target. Warrants are more volatile but offer a ton of upside. I set a limit at $2 today and it fucking hit. I can't believe I got them that cheap.\n\nThese warrants WILL hit $3 easy as they get closer to their merger. This one will start to get more attention and start to climb, and I'll be at $3 or probably closer to $4 or $5 in a month. Like I said, Cramer fucking LOVES this CEO and will 100% have him on Mad Money to jerk this thing higher. You'll want to get in on these warrants before that happens.\n\n**Buy VSPR or VSPRW (warrants) and thank me when you're rich.**", "author_fullname": "t2_17abjqzd", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "$VSPR HydraFacial - Major Becky Stock + Undervalued SPAC set to \ud83d\ude80", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kbgmo1", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 73, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 73, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1607767917.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong><em>My position: 25,000 warrants at $2/share - $50,000 bet</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Alright fellow tards listen up. $VSPR is a SPAC that has officially announced a merger with Hydrafacial.
