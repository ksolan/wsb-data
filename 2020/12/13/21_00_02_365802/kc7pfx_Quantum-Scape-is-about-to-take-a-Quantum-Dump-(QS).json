{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Alright you *shrimp-dick fuck nuggets*, listen up because we\u2019re making fucking tendies. QS or QuantumScape has been seeing crazy momentum in the market recently. They are trading at around 63, but I think this is going to absolutely DUMP on December 21st and possibly longer.\n\nSo let\u2019s look at Quantum Scape, they are a battery company that merged with KCAC (Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp), and what is even more interesting, is that Volkswagen has been invested and partnered with this company since 2012.  \n\nAccording to this source\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/vw-backed-quantumscape/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/vw-backed-quantumscape/)\n\n\u201cVolkswagen entered the picture in 2012. The automaker has invested a total of $300 million in QuantumScape, including $200 million this year.\u201d *Pay attention to the 200 million this year, it may be very big, but we will come back to that at the very end.* \n\nThe same article states the following, \u201cQuantumScape said it was able to raise more than $700 million through the business combination, a figure that includes $500 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE. The raise was anchored by institutional investors including **Fidelity Management & Research Company** and **Janus Transaction**\u201d\n\nSo we see 500 million of 700 million dollars are from PIPE shares. Here\u2019s the part where our dick go a slack 2.5in, to firm 3in\u2026\n\n**Pipe shares can be sold after a certain amount of time**, and we all know what happens when massive sell off\u2019s happen.  \n\nAccording to the Registration Statement published by the SEC about Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp, \u201cPursuant to the Subscription Agreements, Kensington **agreed** that, **within 15 business days** after the Closing (the \u201cFiling Deadline\u201d), Kensington will **file** **with** the SEC (at Kensington\u2019s sole cost and expense) a registration statement **registering the resale** of the PIPE Shares.\u201d\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811414/000119312520290474/d14810ds4a.htm\n\nLet\u2019s break down what this means exactly because the language can be confusing (at least it was to me at first because I\u2019m retarded, why else am I here?).\n\nThere is a 15 day countdown starting AFTER their closing day, this was Nov 27th when they officially merged, which was a Friday. Because this 15 day \u201ccountdown\u201d only includes business days, that means the countdown actually starts the following Monday, Nov 30th, since that is the next business day that follows the closing day. Now, during this countdown Kensington will file WITH the SEC a \u201cregistration statement registering the resale of PIPE shares\u201d. So this registration statement will register the shares to be sold. Now, the word \u201cregister\u201d for the resale of the shares may sound ambiguous. Does it mean they now have the potential to be sold, but maybe on a different day? Does this registration mean they CAN IN FACT be sold once they\u2019re registered? Well this next piece of info will be useful to understand, hopefully making your smooth marble brains get some fucking wrinkles.  \n\n\u201cSince this offering was a PIPE, the buyers cannot sell their shares until the company files its resale registration statement with the SEC.\u00a0**However, an issuer generally cannot sell more than 20% of its outstanding stock at a discount without receiving prior approval from current shareholders**.\u201d *(We will get to the importance of the bolded area at the end)*\n\nSource: \n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipe.asp#:\\~:text=Since%20this%20offering%20was%20a,prior%20approval%20from%20current%20shareholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipe.asp#:~:text=Since%20this%20offering%20was%20a,prior%20approval%20from%20current%20shareholders).\n\n\u201cOnce the SEC declares the registration statement effective, the PIPE investors are then generally able to freely resell their shares in the trading market.\u201d\n\n[https://www.paulhastings.com/docs/default-source/PDFs/715.pdf](https://www.paulhastings.com/docs/default-source/PDFs/715.pdf)\n\nYou might ask \u201cIs there a lock up for these PIPE shares?\u201d And the answer to that is that it is contingent on whether or not the resale registration statement is *effective* or not. So far as I can tell (once again, am retarded), at the end of the 15 day countdown, it\u2019s merely a countdown to have a resale registration agreement written up in general, not necessarily an effective one.  \n\nHowever, from the same SEC document it states \u201cKensington is separately required at all times to maintain an **effective** resale registration statement for the benefit of the Holders.\u201d\n\nSo, now we know they have to make this registration AND they have to do it in a 15 business day period. With some math we can figure out exactly what day PIPE shares can be sold off. I\u2019m not going to talk down to you autists, even though you\u2019re retarded, but 15 business days after November 30th is December 18th. But December 18th is the fifteenth day of the countdown, so it can\u2019t be sold then. Keep in mind that December 18th is a Friday also, so we can expect a BLOODY RED MONDAY for QS if they are going to sell their PIPE shares. Now that\u2019s a big IF.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at just how much PIPE shares make up of the total shares.  \n\nFrom the same SEC document\u2026\n\n\u201c\u2018PIPE\u2019 means the sale of PIPE Shares to the Subscribers, for a purchase price of **$10.00 per share** and an **aggregate purchase price of $500\u00a0million**, in a private placement.\u201d\n\nSo what we are looking at is 50 million shares potentially sold off on Monday the 18th. How much is this in reality?\n\nWell according to [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qs/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qs/institutional-holdings)\n\nTheir outstanding shares right now are 189 million. This means that these pipe shares make up 26.5% of ALL of QS\u2019s shares. If we were to see a sell off of this amount, the value of QS would plunder to such an inconceivable amount we could walk away with major tendies.\n\nNow the question is\u2026.are they going to sell their shares? Well if we take a look at WHO bought these PIPE shares, we can most likely answer that. Fidelity and Janus are both investment companies who are involved in mutual funds and have clients that they make money for. Because these pipe shares were valued at 10 dollar each, while also looking at QS\u2019s current price. They are currently up 600%+ with 50 million shares\u2026would you take that profit?\n\nNot only that, but the discussion of the \u201cSPAC bubble\u201d has been trending for a few weeks now. As we know, SPAC\u2019s have been huge this year, and the \u201cSPAC bubble\u201d is the fear of overvaluing company\u2019s that IPO in mass quantities which results in a huge crash later on.  \n\nDo you think Fidelity hasn\u2019t heard of this? Why would Fidelity and Janus take a risk of getting more money when they are up 600%+ AND they have clients to look after? The fact of the matter is, is they won\u2019t take this risk, the amount of money gained and any potential of a SPAC bubble popping would have any investor taking profits ASAP.\n\nNow, there were two things I mentioned in the post that I would discuss now. That is Volkswagens involvement in QS and this quote \n\n\u201cHowever, an issuer generally cannot sell more than 20% of its outstanding stock at a discount without receiving prior approval from current shareholders.\u201d\n\nIn regards to Volkswagen, they have been involved with QS since 2012, they could potentially have shares that they want to sell. They also gave 200 million dollars this year, could this be the purchasing of PIPE shares? Who knows\u2026.I sure as fuck don\u2019t, but the potential of more shares being sold from another company involved in QS is something that is good for this. If not, it doesn\u2019t matter all that much given the other information, since it still stands true with or without Volkswagens involvement.\n\nNow, in regards to the quote mentioned before, it could be the case that on December 21st, only 20% of the 50 million shares that Fidelity and Janus hold will be sold. Even so, 20% of 50 million is still 10 million shares or around 5.3% of the outstanding shares that QS has.  \n\nIn conclusion, I think we are looking at a great opportunity to make tendies boys.  \n\nTLDR; Eat grass, smoke ass, short QS, make tendies\n\nPositions to get in on: Dec 24 50p \n\nYou could go further expiration, or you could go further OTM. Who am I kidding though, you idiots are gonna grab FD\u2019s. Just make sure it\u2019s not December 18th.", "author_fullname": "t2_25h4teb0", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Quantum Scape is about to take a Quantum Dump (QS)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kc7pfx", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 72, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 72, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1607880036.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Alright you <em>shrimp-dick fuck nuggets</em>, listen up because we\u2019re making fucking tendies.
