{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**For months now, each meeting of the FED and Jerome Powell speech has stated the same things in varied terms:** 1) We are not raising interest rates 2) We really, really need a congressional stimulus and 3) Yes we are deep in our fucking bag, but we still got Qauntitiative Easing tools, so don't sleep\n\nGiven this repetitiveness of guidance, you'd assume the FOMC meetings to come are just boring ass affairs.  But, if you dig a little deeper into the nerdom, there are specific, subtle reasons this meeting in particular could have a huge affect on quantitative easing measures and the broader market, including SPY.\n\n**I\u2019m particularly viewing this through the lens of Federal Reserve pushback to Treasury and Congress**. His rhetoric has been clear; \u2018we have done what we are going to do, for now, and the onus for a healthy economy is on the fiscal stimulus.  Our measures designed to be a temporary stopgap, not polic\u2019 Yet the treasury and congress haven\u2019t done their part. But his response choices do exist; and are more subtly complex than it may seem.  Let's take a journey through QE, and what the options are at the FOMC.\n\nThe first thing to understand is what the 2 popularized big guns of QE are, and that it is very, very unlikely we're going to see change to them.\n\n**1) The lowering of the Federals funds rate**\n*Current: ~0 (.25%, goal between 0 and .25%)*\n*Last year this time: 1.75%*\n**Any likely changes?** Hell no\nGood news is that the Fed rate is obviously not increasing, as Powell has made it clear this isn't even on the table until 2023.  The other option--a negative federal interest rate--is also unlikely.  Not solely because of the fact that it's a tool to be saved for a much more distressed market, but because it would signal a level of panic that the Fed would see as a detrement to the markets, particularly heading into the new year.\n**MM quote:**\n>... the Fed will leave the Fed funds target rate at 0-0.25% next Wednesday, promising to keep it there until the goal of maximum employment and inflation being \u201con track to moderately exceed 2% for some time\u201d is met \u2013 their \u201cdot\u201d diagram will continue to suggest this won\u2019t happen before 2023.\n\n[MORE HERE](https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/fundamental/forecast/weekly/usd/2020/12/13/US-Dollar-Outlook-Hinges-on-Federal-Reserve-Interest-Rate-Decision.html)\n\n**2) Expansion of Fed asset purchases**\n*Current: $120B (80B of treasuries purchases, 40B of Mortgage-backed securities)*\nThis has been the Fed's most powerful tool in stimulating the markets, particularly the treasuries.  More on this type of activity here [DD link], but the long and short of it is that the more treasuries the Fed purchases, the more market participants are pressured to buy stonks instead of bonds.\n**Any likely changes?** Probably not.\nGiven that the stimulus talks are stalling for like the 70th time while COVID cases are rising and important economic factors like weekly jobs numbers are tanking,  there *has* been reserved optimism that the Fed could decide to expand it's balance sheet on asset purchases.  The overall sentiment, however, is that its unlikely to see an expansion for the same reason we won't see a change to the Federal interest rate: the desire not to create panic at such a sensitive time for the markets.\n**MM quote:**\n>\tThey have to get incrementally more dovish next week...Increasing the size of QE might send a little more alarming signal than they would like to take at this moment.\u201d\n\n[MORE HERE](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/heres-everything-the-federal-reserve-could-do-at-its-policy-meeting-next-week.html)\n\n**So, if these changes are unlikely, what are the options left, then?**  They are subtle, but important; two FOMC factors that may not make a huge splash in the news, but could make a huge splash in the markets.\n\n**1) Tweaking which treasuries they purchase, shuffling around the 80B to longer dated maturities:**\nThe Fed could decide to fuck around with the steepening yield curve.  By moving their purchases to more longer dated bond maturities (for example, shifting more of the 80B QE fund to purchasing 20/30 year maturity bonds instead of 10) they could end up providing a fairly large boost to stonk buying without actually spending more money overall on the balance sheet.  There is chatter that the Fed wants to do whatever is possible to keep yields on the 20 at 1% or lower, and this move could do it.\n**Is this likely to happen?** 50/50\nSome market watchers think it will happen because the factors mentioned earlier necessitate it (stimulus deadlock, virus uptick, struggling jobs numbers).  Yes, there is a vaccine coming, but the market has to *survive* in the meantime, and a lot of factors are stacked against it.\n**Do I think it will happen?**Probably not.  \nI don\u2019t think the Fed wants to roil the treasuries market around the holidays, AND would want to stay hands off with stimulus talks ongoing while this meeting is taking place\u2014the Fed wants, and needs, to put pressure on congress for fiscal stimulus and leaving the yield curve untouched will do that.  Any further yield curve tinkering will signal to congress that help is there for their precious stonks wiht or without the stimulus passing.  If stimmy talks fail again, though, I definitely think this could come to fruition at the January meeting.\nMM quote:\n>A number of economists believe that the Fed should tamp down on any further steepening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve by shifting the focus of its purchases to longer-dated bonds from shorter-dated instruments.\n\n**2) Outcome-based guidance:**\nThis term sounds like bullshit but it is not.  This essentially means \u201cthe Fed will peg QE measures 2021 to how the economy is performing, on this predetermined scale\u201d  The reason it\u2019s not bullshit is because, without discussing the Federal funds rate, it gives both the public and (probably more importantly) Congress an idea of what kind of footing the economy needs to be on, by when, and how the Fed will respond.\n**Is this lilkely to happen?** Yes.  \nMost market watchers are expecting some sort of firm guidance to show us where we could go in 2021.\n**Do I think it will happen? ** Yes.  \nI think, [especially after the Treasury started beef with the Fed by putting an end to critical crises-era programs ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/treasury-seeks-to-extend-some-emergency-fed-programs-but-end-others-including-main-street-facility.html), the Fed is going to pushback by tying the Fed\u2019\u2019 programming to economic indicators which can be largely effected by fiscal stimulus.  There is more the Fed can do, as they\u2019\u2019e stated many times, but at this point our growing economic woes are self-inflicted, and I expect guidance to reflect that.\nMM quote:\n>We could see a change in guidance relating to the asset purchases, which currently stand at $80bn of Treasuries and $40bn of Mortgage Backed Securities each month. At present they merely comment that \u201cover coming months\u201d the purchases will continue \u201cat least at the current pace\u201d. Officials have hinted they could make the pace of purchases more conditional on economic conditions. \n\n[MORE HERE](https://think.ing.com/articles/us-what-to-expect-from-the-december-fomc-meeting/)\n\n**Conclusions I\u2019m drawing:**\nI don\u2019t think the Fed is offering shit in terms of solid market help through, really, the only potential way it would\u2014\u2014a shift into purchasing a larger amount of longer-dated maturities within the current 80B treasury purchase budget.  It seems like the market, from a lot of articles I\u2019ve read, is holding out hope on that (especially in light of worsening conditions), so if it doesn\u2019t happen we definitely got a dip coming.\n\n**I\u2019m viewing the importance of this meeting in the context of several problematic outside factors\u2014stimulus talks stalling, Brexit and the Europoors on they full Oliver Twist rn, and terrible job numbers likely coming this week.**  I know PFE was given the go-ahead this weekend, but I don\u2019t have much confidence in that carrying us much past the likely green Monday with such a turbulent week ahead (my 367c 12/14 im bagholding certainly fucking hope so on the Monday part).\n\nSPY is already unperforming by typical December standards, and certainly by the year\u2019s insane standard. **So then, by my logic, market momentum truly becomes an issue of two factors: FOMC meeting results, and the stimulus talks going well.  I will be the first to admit that my optimism on the stimulus is seeming increasingly incorrect**, and I\u2019m growing doubtful it will be finished next week\u2014though there will be lots of little meaningless \u201ctalk\u201c going well\u201d pum\u201ds.\n*The questions is\u2014will\u2014Pow and the FED use their big, swinging QE tools to save EOY market optimism during this FOMC meeting? For me, the signs point to no.*\n\n**Positions**\nI know I know, I literally just said I hate VIX and have broken up with it, but I took another look, and rethought about it\u2019s purpose.  **I do believe by Tuesday, especially assuming we are green-ish or flat Monday, **there will be a spike in options premiums in preparation for the FOMC and Stimulus shenanigans.
