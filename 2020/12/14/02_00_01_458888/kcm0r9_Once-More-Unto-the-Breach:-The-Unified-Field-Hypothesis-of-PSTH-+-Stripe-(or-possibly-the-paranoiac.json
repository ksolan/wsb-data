{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Mis compas, mis amigos y amigas, fellow autists and retards of WSB,\n\nI return to you now with the second installation of my Big Crazy Idea about why Bill Ackman's SPAC, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, and what is shaping up to be the most important company for the economic development of the internet, Stripe, could be teaming up to take steps in order to wrest back control of the financial system from the veritable freak show of private equity and investment banking, which I will collectively refer to as Big Capital. The previous post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kbjpqy/an_alternative_hypothesis_for_psth_stripe_for_the/) and serves as an introductory foray into institutional financial crime. If you thought that one was long, strap the fuck in, because we're going deep into the muck with our third eyes wide open.\n\n#Big Capital, Big Crime, and Rivers of Blood\n\nThis section will attempt to provide some historical context on the history of Big Capital with a particular focus on the inextricable links between intelligence agencies (mainly the Central Intelligence Agency and its predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services) and Wall Street, starting around the time of World War II. It will lean heavily on the work of Michael S. Judge, whose podcast [Death is Just Around the Corner](https://www.patreon.com/deathcorner/) has become an integral part of my understanding of the nature of American imperialism, which has been largely scrubbed from the history books. It will also draw from excellent books including but not limited to Vincent Bevins' [The Jakarta Method](https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/vincent-bevins/the-jakarta-method/9781541724013/) and Stephen Kinzer's [The Brothers](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250053121) and [Poisoner in Chief](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250140432). In the interest of accessibility, I will be supplying Wikipedia articles for further reading, but with the caveat that [Wikipedia itself cowtows to the American imperial project](https://thegrayzone.com/2020/06/10/wikipedia-formally-censors-the-grayzone-as-regime-change-advocates-monopolize-editing/) and **should not be taken as an authoritative account of history.**\n\nI think the best place to start this story is with Allen Dulles, the longest serving director of the CIA, and his brother John Foster Dulles, who was Dwight Eisenhower's Secretary of State. Before joining the federal government, the Dulles brothers worked for [United Fruit Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company), which is now known as Chiquita Brands International (yes, the \ud83c\udf4c company), where John served as legal counsel and Allen was on the board of directors. The United Fruit Company was a key driver of the CIA-led [1954 Guatemalan coup that ousted the democratically elected Jacobo Arbenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) and replaced him with the dictator Carlos Castillo Armas, which will be a recurring theme in this missive. Put a pin in this for now, because we have to backtrack a little further first.\n\nIt is critical to understand that the CIA and the agencies that came before it, are deeply rooted in the boy's club of Wall Street from the years between World War I and World War II, and that pipeline catapulted people like [Prescott Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott_Bush) (father of George H.W. Bush and grandfather of George W. Bush) to the highest levels of the American government. Most of these roaches skittered out of investment banks like [Brown Brothers Harriman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Brothers_Harriman_%26_Co.) or law firms like [Sullivan & Cromwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sullivan_%26_Cromwell), both institutions that still stand to this day.\n\nPrescott Bush and the Dulles brothers were up to some real sketchy shit before, during, and after WWII, [having business ties to German industrialists that helped finance Hitler's rise to power and helping Nazis launder money and transport looted art and valuables through European banks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar). Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg even went so far to say that [\"The Dulles brothers were traitors.\"](http://libcom.org/library/making-killing-christian-dewar) Prescott and the Dulles brothers were probably not literally card-carrying Nazis, but the model of fusing big business and central government, which the CIA was based on and adheres to up to this very day, [**is explicitly fascist when going off of the dictionary definition of the word**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism) (read: not using it as a proxy for \"person I disagree with politically\" as it's so often used today). Did you know that the CIA has an active venture capital operation called [In-Q-Tel](https://www.iqt.org/) and that Palantir's only early investor besides Peter Thiel was [one and the same](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/21/magazine/palantir-alex-karp.html)? Now you do.\n\nIn the last days and immediate aftermath of WWII, the intelligence agencies spearheaded an effort by the US government called [Operation Paperclip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip), which was designed to save Nazi and Japanese scientists from the gallows and put them to work developing weapons programs in the US. [Wernher von Braun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun), chief architect of the Saturn V \ud83d\ude80 that sent Apollo to the \ud83c\udf11? Operation Paperclip. [Shiro Ishii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shir%C5%8D_Ishii), a man who was loading grenades full of plague bacteria and sewing babies together and shit in Manchukuo (Japanese-occupied China)? Operation Paperclip.\n\nAt this point in the story, WWII is over and the USSR has become the Big Bad Mans of the time period from 1945 to 1991 that we collectively refer to as the Cold War. Unfortunately, the Cold War was not actually very cold, and instead took the shape of a seemingly endless series of proxy wars and regime change operations led by Western intelligence agencies attempting, with various degrees of success, to overthrow democratically elected leftists and appoint authoritarian leaders with the backing of weapons and money from the CIA. This is not an exhaustive list, but includes examples like the [1953 Iranian coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) that overthrew Mohammad Mosaddegh and replaced him with Shah Pahlavi, the aforementioned 1954 Guatemalan coup, the [mass killings in Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_mass_killings_of_1965%E2%80%9366) that ultimately resulted in the removal of Sukarno and a 31 year military junta under Suharto, the [1973 Chilean coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) that brought Augusto Pinochet to power, and both the [Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War) and [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War) Wars, in which the greatest military in the world was epically pwned by a bunch of starving jungle fighters using slingshots and AK-47s.\n\nThe underlying reason for a lot of this carnage, besides the stated goal of beating back the spectre of communism or whatever the fuck? Resources. Iran had oil, Chile had nationalized the copper mines that Big Capital needed to fuel the electronics boom, and both the [Golden Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_\\(Southeast_Asia\\)) and [Golden Crescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Crescent) were fertile ground for growing opium, which was used to make the heroin the CIA trafficked all over the world and sold to buy weapons that they then gave to the dictators they propped up, sometimes [using the bodies of dead soldiers as mules](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/17/archives/drug-feared-sent-in-bodies-of-gis-court-told-that-smugglers-used.html). \n\nDoes any of this sound familiar and related to the current day? How about the overthrow of [Evo Morales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Bolivian_protests) in Bolivia, which was applauded by [Elon Musk](https://imgur.com/XCsXNTJ), who wants cheap access to their copper mines so he can make batteries for his shitty cars? How about the Forever War in the Middle East, which has effectively turned [Afghanistan into a narco-state?](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/09/how-the-heroin-trade-explains-the-us-uk-failure-in-afghanistan) How about the endless revolving door between the Pentagon, defense contractors, and the rest of the federal government, as exemplified most recently by the nomination of [Raytheon board member General Lloyd Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Austin) to be Joe Biden's Secretary of Defense? That's right, you blue-pilled goldfish, the Democrats are not your friends either.\n\n#The Stripe and PSTH Angles\n\nAlright, enough psychic assault for the moment. Let's talk about Stripe for a bit. As stated previously, Stripe is building the infrastructure that the internet economy runs on. The Collison brothers, those cheeky little leprechauns, seem like they're wired pretty differently than most of the money grubbing bug people that inhabit Silicon Valley. [Take this clip of co-founder and CEO Patrick Collison](https://youtu.be/knXY3Rwtfww?t=1495) talking about the nature of motivation (listen through to ~27:20 at least). [Or this one of co-founder and president John Collison](https://youtu.be/N_W62v3RYwc?t=239) talking about the need to support small businesses who have been reamed by the pandemic and build Stripe bigger and better as a service to the small fish in the ocean (listen through to the end on this one).\n\nBill Ackman is a signatory on the [Giving Pledge](https://givingpledge.org/Pledger.aspx?id=157), and as discussed in the previous post, is also not your typical Wall Street swamp monster. He remarried last year and has a kid that's a little over a year old by this point. He deeply understands that the finance game is rigged against the little guys, that Big Capital has wrapped its disgusting slimy tentacles all over the world, and is choking more life out of it every single day. Could it be that he wants to do whatever he can to stop the world his kid will grow up in from devolving further into some kind of [Mad Max](https://imgur.com/HTpAmLG) scenario?\n\n[The order of operations for how PSTH is structured is flipped on its head](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/bill-ackman-and-tontine-holdings-rewrite-the-terms-for-spacs.html) from the way previous SPACs have been run by institutions like Goldman Sachs (remember, we hate them) with regard to sponsor compensation. Pershing Square isn't taking a thing until the investors in the SPAC see a 20% return, whereas most SPACs include clauses allowing the sponsors to snatch cheap warrants with their grubby little hands because they are run by unapologetic money pigs.\n\n#An Aside About C\u042fyptocurrency\n\nI, like most of you, am way too stupid to understand how the fuck c\u042fypto actually works on a fundamental level, but I think it's pretty clear that the reason it has value at all is as a hedge against total economic societal collapse like we've been seeing most recently in places like Venezuela, which underwent inflation to the tune of nearly [***54 million percent***](https://venezuelaaldia.com/2019/05/28/banco-central-venezuela-hiperinflacion-2016/) between 2016 and 2019. Hey, what the fuck is that Juan Guiado guy up to? Oh, [he's a CIA sock puppet](https://thegrayzone.com/2019/01/29/the-making-of-juan-guaido-how-the-us-regime-change-laboratory-created-venezuelas-coup-leader/).\n\nIt is interesting to note that Stripe used to support c\u042fypto but eliminated that functionality, at least directly, back in [2018](https://imgur.com/crnp9iJ). Patrick Collison used to talk about c\u042fypto frequently and would say things like [this](https://imgur.com/OSbi8uz) (take note of the date) but has been largely silent on the issue for years. I think it's possible that he and his brother have come around to thinking that while c\u042fypto is a heady big brain idea, it's too inaccessible for dummies like you and me, who just want to buy a cup of coffee without paying $20 in transaction fees. They could be trying to build a vanguard that would make such a thing unnecessary for a functioning society, a system that continues to run on dollars, euros, yen, and yuan. \n\nThat, and the original idea for c\u042fypto came from [another part of the bowels of the Deep State, the NSA](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm). You know, that thing Edward Snowden revealed as spying on everyone all the time with the support of [the tech giants](https://imgur.com/buIPP1S), but we're mostly all cool with because hey, cat videos and free porn!\n\nI do have some suspicions about Snowden, being a former CIA contractor and all, and his insistence that privacy-minded folks use Tor, which is and always has been a [project of the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies](https://www.wired.com/story/cia-sets-up-shop-on-tor/). If you, like me, used c\u042fypto to buy drugs on the dark net back in the heady days of 2015 when they were basically crime bucks, you're also probably on a watchlist somewhere at Langley.\n\n#Conclusion\n\nIf you've reached this point without your eyes rolling back in your head and starting to drool, I sincerely applaud you \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f. I hope that you've learned something new and are now thinking about what bigger brains than you and I have, like those of Bill Ackman and the Collisons, could be trying to put out there in the world, if a PSTH + Stripe union is truly in the cards.\n\nI do find it quite interesting to look at the list of [Restricted Businesses](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses) at Stripe. It includes a lot of things that Ackman has historically and more recently placed in his sights as the targets of his wrath, like multi-level marketing schemes and pseudopharmaceuticals (Herbalife) and pornography (Pornhub versus the credit card companies). There's also things you can extrapolate outward from if you want to get real wacky and use looser definitions, like \"gambling\" and \"get rich quick schemes\" (i.e. Robinhood).\n\nThank you for reading my brain ejaculation, and always remember: Big Brother is watching you.\n\n\n**TLDR: Reining in the types of financial crime that have created this fucked up world we're all stuck in is imperative to building a future that is better and more equitable for people all around the world, not just in the United States. A merger of Stripe with PSTH could represent a gigantic leap forward for driving a sword into the heart of the beast of Big Capital. You could get in now instead of the alternative that the traditional IPO process provides, where the big institutions get the first crack at everything and leave table scraps for the rest of us to fight over.

[Roth IRA](https://imgur.com/MDO1OJU) and [Tastyworks](https://imgur.com/glDGYRs).

Patrick Collison used to talk about c\u042fypto frequently and would say things like <a href=\"https://imgur.com/OSbi8uz\">this</a> (take note of the date) but has been largely silent on the issue for years. I think it&#39;s possible that he and his brother have come around to thinking that while c\u042fypto is a heady big brain idea, it&#39;s too inaccessible for dummies like you and me, who just want to buy a cup of coffee without paying $20 in transaction fees. They could be trying to build a vanguard that would make such a thing unnecessary for a functioning society, a system that continues to run on dollars, euros, yen, and yuan. </p>\n\n<p>That, and the original idea for c\u042fypto came from <a href=\"http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm\">another part of the bowels of the Deep State, the NSA</a>. You know, that thing Edward Snowden revealed as spying on everyone all the time with the support of <a href=\"https://imgur.com/buIPP1S\">the tech giants</a>, but we&#39;re mostly all cool with because hey, cat videos and free porn!</p>\n\n<p>I do have some suspicions about Snowden, being a former CIA contractor and all, and his insistence that privacy-minded folks use Tor, which is and always has been a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/cia-sets-up-shop-on-tor/\">project of the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies</a>. If you, like me, used c\u042fypto to buy drugs on the dark net back in the heady days of 2015 when they were basically crime bucks, you&#39;re also probably on a watchlist somewhere at Langley.</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>If you&#39;ve reached this point without your eyes rolling back in your head and starting to drool, I sincerely applaud you \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f. I hope that you&#39;ve learned something new and are now thinking about what bigger brains than you and I have, like those of Bill Ackman and the Collisons, could be trying to put out there in the world, if a PSTH + Stripe union is truly in the cards.</p>\n\n<p>I do find it quite interesting to look at the list of <a href=\"https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses\">Restricted Businesses</a> at Stripe. It includes a lot of things that Ackman has historically and more recently placed in his sights as the targets of his wrath, like multi-level marketing schemes and pseudopharmaceuticals (Herbalife) and pornography (Pornhub versus the credit card companies). There&#39;s also things you can extrapolate outward from if you want to get real wacky and use looser definitions, like &quot;gambling&quot; and &quot;get rich quick schemes&quot; (i.e. Robinhood).</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for reading my brain ejaculation, and always remember: Big Brother is watching you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR: Reining in the types of financial crime that have created this fucked up world we&#39;re all stuck in is imperative to building a future that is better and more equitable for people all around the world, not just in the United States. A merger of Stripe with PSTH could represent a gigantic leap forward for driving a sword into the heart of the beast of Big Capital. You could get in now instead of the alternative that the traditional IPO process provides, where the big institutions get the first crack at everything and leave table scraps for the rest of us to fight over. PSTH \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcc8</strong></p>\n\n<h1>positions or ban</h1>\n\n<p>since I now have little piggies oinking away at me about positions, here you go. <a href=\"https://imgur.com/MDO1OJU\">Roth IRA</a> and <a href=\"https://imgur.com/glDGYRs\">Tastyworks</a>. As stated in the first post, I intend to liquidate a large chunk of my mutual fund holdings in the IRA when the year end dividend goes out in a couple weeks and put that money into more PSTH shares.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/g49ixr2dz2s-n8TBugfGn21vrL3q5m0HFHyBO4rfvyo.jpg?auto=webp&s=a45e76b7081d5644b5459cd4d9f728b0f3f8182a", "width": 600, "height": 315}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/g49ixr2dz2s-n8TBugfGn21vrL3q5m0HFHyBO4rfvyo.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=fbca368045a5b32cbbf9023ba64874607008876a", "width": 108, "height": 56}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/g49ixr2dz2s-n8TBugfGn21vrL3q5m0HFHyBO4rfvyo.jpg?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=2e40c32d3a4155372b7acf1a8645113a641e2b3c", "width": 216, "height": 113}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/g49ixr2dz2s-n8TBugfGn21vrL3q5m0HFHyBO4rfvyo.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=7e62af37f74f8d09fa517976f2966f8e50023471", "width": 320, "height": 168}], "variants": {}, "id": "Xd0qXyZwPczyG2DT7L2BlHDvFWRNTbLm6pm5ULleTFs"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "coin_price": 150, "id": "award_f44611f1-b89e-46dc-97fe-892280b13b82", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png", "days_of_premium": 0, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=16&height=16&auto=webp&s=a5662dfbdb402bf67866c050aa76c31c147c2f45", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=32&height=32&auto=webp&s=a6882eb3f380e8e88009789f4d0072e17b8c59f1", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=48&height=48&auto=webp&s=e50064b090879e8a0b55e433f6ee61d5cb5fbe1d", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=64&height=64&auto=webp&s=8e5bb2e76683cb6b161830bcdd9642049d6adc11", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=128&height=128&auto=webp&s=eda4a9246f95f42ee6940cc0ec65306fd20de878", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Thank you stranger.
