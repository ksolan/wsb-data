The only reason I am not posting this on r/investing is because you asstards need help. There is someserious chicken fucking tendies to be made here. I'm the guy who famously claimed that Bob Swan, Intel CEO, should fabricate a silicone butt and fuck it during Intel's next earning call to appease stock holders instead of going over their financials: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6ioot/intel\\_is\\_fucked/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6ioot/intel_is_fucked/)\n\nAs it turns out, I was right and Bob Swan showed everyone how much of a dipshit he really is and how he literally knows nothing about this industry. I doubled my principal on my last Intel put and I plan to do the same with my next more here.First, let us a take a good look at what happened to intel. There is so much wrong with that company and I talked about it a lot in my last post. This analyst, Stacy Rasgon, who actually seems to have a basic understanding of this shit, sums it up fairly well. Click the fucking link asshole. Listen to him:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzTg6vWgDhQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzTg6vWgDhQ)\n\nSo what do we have here:\n\n* \"If you start digging in, theres almost no good news here. Gross margins have collapsed.\"\n* \"This is the beginning of the bear thesis which seems to be embedded in the numbers here.\"\n* \"Current trajectory of the business does not look good.\"\n\nJesus Christ. Should have gone with the silicone butt bobby. Intel is ACTUALLY on fire. So what the fuck does intel plan to do about it? Bob Swan said himself on the earnings call that he wants to go with TSMC. Interesting choice Bobby Boy. Interesting because for once this is not a bad decision. But WHY would Bob Swan want to go with TSMC?\n\nTSMC is perhaps the most strategically important company in the world right now. The American government has dramatically increased military operations with Taiwan.One very critical point that the average wsb idiot misses is that TSMC is only a foundry. Because of this they can focus only on improving their chip-manufacturing and not have to worry at all about selling/marketing the chips.\n\nSome of the major customers of TSMC are \\[3\\]:\n\n* AMD\n* Apple (25% of TSMC revenue)\n* Broadcom\n* Marvell\n* MediaTek\n* Nvidia\n* Qualcomm\n* Xilinx\n\nSoon Intel as well. Simply put, if any one of those companies above do well then TSMC wins. Their financials are perfect, they are the world leaders in their covid-proof industry, the only fab with a 5nm process and have a ton of massive customers for whom they have great relationships with (they built and bankrolled a new fabrication center just for Apple for fucks sake). If you pay close attention to this stuff, you may have heard how Nvidia recently went to Samsung for fabrication, yeah, Nvidia backtracked quickly on that and they are going back to TSMC due to Samsungs shit yields \\[4\\].\n\n**Stop massaging your wife's boyfriend's vas deferens and listen up.** The American government is currently preparing for a war with china over TSMC. The US is rapidly heading from a cold to a hot war with China. Some experts, such as Niall Furgeson, a well respected Stanford historian is already calling it \"Cold War 2\" \\[7\\]. There is a video you must watch on this topic. It is produced by a Chinese-Hating-Korean-Trump-Supporter but it is most primary sources from China and it sums up quite well the China internal sentiment on this issue. (Click it you fucking autist):\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2uP\\_8YoJTU&ab\\_channel=KoreanaJones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2uP_8YoJTU&ab_channel=KoreanaJones)\n\nWell, shit. So here we are:\n\n* The US can no longer fabricate semiconductors, only Taiwan can.\n* America will do everything is can as a matter of national security to protect TSMC.\n* USA bans China's only serious semi conductor fabricator SMIC. \\[5\\]\n* USA bans anyone from doing business with Chinese tech firms like Huawei. TSMC even confirmed AGAIN they will not fabricate for Huawei. \\[6\\]\n* Taiwan HATES China so they don't actually even want to work with their shitty fake tech companies.\n* Semiconductors are critical to a modern economy/military. (Xi JinPing has said this himself.)\n* Taiwan's military is a joke compared to China's so they will do everything to appease the Americansfor the survival of their nation.\n* Hong Kong proved to the world, especially Taiwan, that China has zero interest in honoring any governance agreements made. This raises the stakes for Taiwan dramatically as a cooperation with China means a complete erasure of their culture and history.\n* ASML, the people who make the machines for TSMC, are a Dutch company in the EU. Unsurprisingly, EU has taken a similar stance, including military aid, for Taiwan. ASML is a \"crown jewel\" for the EU and they make a shit ton supporting TSMC.\n\nSo what is the bear case for a company that is at the heart of US/Taiwan/Europe national security interests? A company which is ACTUALLY technologically superior to their competition and is basically the only game in town?The bear case is potential war with China. But if that happens your positions are going to shit anyway.\n\n**Options (Wish I bought more):**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r9uchpxpd0561.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ba1bc3a98783399ddfe80637b527ceb032ec742\n\n**Stocks:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knuge7gsd0561.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b72bd468a5e77f97a423835eaaf2e87b6c1d8275\n\n**References**\n\n1.
