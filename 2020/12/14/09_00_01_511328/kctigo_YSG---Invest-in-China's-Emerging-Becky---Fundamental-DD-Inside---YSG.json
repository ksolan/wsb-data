Overview of \"Why\" Chinese Consumer Discretionary:**\n\nHere's a quick overview of the 14th 5-Year Plan:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[China's 14th 5-Year Plan - Additional details in late Q1'21 \\/ Early Q2'21](https://preview.redd.it/89jdb7op93561.jpg?width=586&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=858f521d1fcf8934997629a40178209074488377)\n\nOn top of fiscal support for these new industries - China is arguably ahead of the entire world in terms of handling COVID-19:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[China's Economy is Growing vs. 2019](https://preview.redd.it/0bvw6r7y93561.jpg?width=1028&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9613a93862dc1b976990f92d1ed7bd2c04a4f35)\n\n**II.

These guys are crushing the Chinese social media game (Rank #1 in Chinese social media):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[As of Sept. \\/ Oct. 2020](https://preview.redd.it/g8sy5mctg3561.jpg?width=643&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae1b1dd0c777073f5b2ae89eb70b2f9ee8518350)\n\nBut the established brands? What about them?\n\n**Chinese people like buying Chinese-branded things:**\n\n[99.5&#37; of Surveyed consumers have used domestic color cosmetic brands \\[1\\]](https://preview.redd.it/ybfjqb57h3561.jpg?width=257&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=871cb1d6dd9564eb63f952ede0b6bfa06de41759)\n\nI'll end this section with a quick snapshot of the management team:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[As of 9\\/30\\/20](https://preview.redd.it/n9w77ybl64561.jpg?width=1260&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7757559049e14f526d7c304eeae22760f8cd9b42)\n\nAll have legit Consumer/Retail experience, CEO/CSO/COO seem to be college buds. CFO is a board member of one WSB's favorites here, XPEV, & has a great track record serving as CFO in numerous public companies. CEO/CFO are also Harvard alums, which is a big buy-in to the waspy Wall Street crowd.\n\n**III. Financials**\n\nHere's a quick snapshot with some cool circles & shit on parts I want to talk about:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[As of 9\\/30\\/20](https://preview.redd.it/1335ft27i3561.jpg?width=618&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a891e9f0e65712ce68d021644111365805abeb4)\n\nSo far we've laid out the upside in the **Revenue growth** case. Historically, they've grown Revenues at a clip of +102% CAGR LTM as of 9/30/20.\n\nOn top of this extraordinary growth, there are some things that can be financially engineered as well.\n\nFirst off - Gross Profit Margins at 63%, while slightly better than the COTY/Kardashian GP Margin of 57%, it's still a ways to go vs. L'Oreal's GP Margins of 73% \\[2\\].\n\n**Why is EBITDA negative?** This is driven by their bloated S&M + G&A expense that clocks in at 56-62% of Revenue (vs. other Chinese brands at \\~41% \\[3\\]), which would be a cause for concern, HOWEVER, the marketing strategy is ***working***, evident in their inventory turnover of 98 - 110 days (shit is flying off the shelves)\n\n* COTY's comes in at 135 days, L'Oreal at 141 Days \\[2\\]. Compared to their Domestic cosmetic company peers they are only bested by Proya by less than 10 days.\n\nThis all culminates into a business that has a cash conversion cycle of 37 days (among the lowest in peer group) with many levers to improve on this that I won't bore you with here. For the curious that want to do their own DD, look at their Payables structure. There's a ton of improvement that can be done here.\n\n**With all this said - Wall Street estimates +78% growth in Net Revenues by 2021E which is woefully conservative, but I'll be using their estimates for the next section on Price Target**\n\nTo end this section, there's a ton of concern for Chinese-listed stocks being very scammy in terms of accounting. While the risk will always be present, it's important to note that one of the largest early investors is Tiger Global Management with billions (\\~202mm shares, \\~30% of total) tied up on YSG. Tiger Global Management is one of Wall Street's preeminent hedge funds, so I'd expect them to know their shit: [https://www.tigerglobal.com/home](https://www.tigerglobal.com/home)\n\n**IV. Price Target**\n\nAt current price of $16.55/Share - they trade at 7.3x EV/2021E Sales & 5.1x EV/2022E Sales. **Important to note: Sales CAGR through 2022E is expected to be +60%, the highest in its compset & a discount to their CAGR so far of +102%.**\n\nThis is vs. the entire beauty comp set of 3.3x / 3.0x, respectively - on average Sales CAGR through 2022E of +**10%**. YSG is expected to grow at ***6x*** the comp set.\n\nWhat about vs. Chinese peers? 4.7x / 3.9x, respectively on +**19%** Sales CAGR through 2022E. YSG is expected to outpace their growth by **3x.**\n\n*So what's the right multiple?*\n\nI'm pegging YSG at 11x EV/Sales on average between 2021E/2022E EV/Sales - this is a **20%** discount in growth vs. their Chinese peers which shakes out to an exit price of **$27.75 per Share or +70% from Current.**\n\nOn the Technical side - look at the chart. Long story short: huge volume on big 'up' days, very low volume on 'down' days. Get your magical crayons working.\n\n**TL;DR. Invest in the Chinese Becky (NYSE: YSG) for potential +70% gains from Current until the Options market gets a bit more affordable.**\n\n\\[1\\] CIC Report\n\n\\[2\\] COTY/L'Oreal Company filings - LTM

What about them?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chinese people like buying Chinese-branded things:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ybfjqb57h3561.jpg?width=257&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=871cb1d6dd9564eb63f952ede0b6bfa06de41759\">99.5&#37; of Surveyed consumers have used domestic color cosmetic brands [1]</a></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll end this section with a quick snapshot of the management team:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/n9w77ybl64561.jpg?width=1260&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7757559049e14f526d7c304eeae22760f8cd9b42\">As of 9/30/20</a></p>\n\n<p>All have legit Consumer/Retail experience, CEO/CSO/COO seem to be college buds. CFO is a board member of one WSB&#39;s favorites here, XPEV, &amp; has a great track record serving as CFO in numerous public companies. CEO/CFO are also Harvard alums, which is a big buy-in to the waspy Wall Street crowd.</p>\n\n<p><strong>III. Financials</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a quick snapshot with some cool circles &amp; shit on parts I want to talk about:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1335ft27i3561.jpg?width=618&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a891e9f0e65712ce68d021644111365805abeb4\">As of 9/30/20</a></p>\n\n<p>So far we&#39;ve laid out the upside in the <strong>Revenue growth</strong> case. Historically, they&#39;ve grown Revenues at a clip of +102% CAGR LTM as of 9/30/20.</p>\n\n<p>On top of this extraordinary growth, there are some things that can be financially engineered as well.</p>\n\n<p>First off - Gross Profit Margins at 63%, while slightly better than the COTY/Kardashian GP Margin of 57%, it&#39;s still a ways to go vs. L&#39;Oreal&#39;s GP Margins of 73% [2].</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is EBITDA negative?</strong> This is driven by their bloated S&amp;M + G&amp;A expense that clocks in at 56-62% of Revenue (vs. other Chinese brands at ~41% [3]), which would be a cause for concern, HOWEVER, the marketing strategy is <strong><em>working</em></strong>, evident in their inventory turnover of 98 - 110 days (shit is flying off the shelves)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>COTY&#39;s comes in at 135 days, L&#39;Oreal at 141 Days [2]. Compared to their Domestic cosmetic company peers they are only bested by Proya by less than 10 days.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This all culminates into a business that has a cash conversion cycle of 37 days (among the lowest in peer group) with many levers to improve on this that I won&#39;t bore you with here. For the curious that want to do their own DD, look at their Payables structure. There&#39;s a ton of improvement that can be done here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>With all this said - Wall Street estimates +78% growth in Net Revenues by 2021E which is woefully conservative, but I&#39;ll be using their estimates for the next section on Price Target</strong></p>\n\n<p>To end this section, there&#39;s a ton of concern for Chinese-listed stocks being very scammy in terms of accounting. While the risk will always be present, it&#39;s important to note that one of the largest early investors is Tiger Global Management with billions (~202mm shares, ~30% of total) tied up on YSG. Tiger Global Management is one of Wall Street&#39;s preeminent hedge funds, so I&#39;d expect them to know their shit: <a href=\"https://www.tigerglobal.com/home\">https://www.tigerglobal.com/home</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>IV. Price Target</strong></p>\n\n<p>At current price of $16.55/Share - they trade at 7.3x EV/2021E Sales &amp; 5.1x EV/2022E Sales. <strong>Important to note: Sales CAGR through 2022E is expected to be +60%, the highest in its compset &amp; a discount to their CAGR so far of +102%.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is vs. the entire beauty comp set of 3.3x / 3.0x, respectively - on average Sales CAGR through 2022E of +<strong>10%</strong>. YSG is expected to grow at <strong><em>6x</em></strong> the comp set.</p>\n\n<p>What about vs. Chinese peers? 4.7x / 3.9x, respectively on +<strong>19%</strong> Sales CAGR through 2022E. YSG is expected to outpace their growth by <strong>3x.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>So what&#39;s the right multiple?</em></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m pegging YSG at 11x EV/Sales on average between 2021E/2022E EV/Sales - this is a <strong>20%</strong> discount in growth vs. their Chinese peers which shakes out to an exit price of <strong>$27.75 per Share or +70% from Current.</strong></p>\n\n<p>On the Technical side - look at the chart. Long story short: huge volume on big &#39;up&#39; days, very low volume on &#39;down&#39; days. Get your magical crayons working.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR. Invest in the Chinese Becky (NYSE: YSG) for potential +70% gains from Current until the Options market gets a bit more affordable.</strong></p>\n\n<p>[1] CIC Report</p>\n\n<p>[2] COTY/L&#39;Oreal
