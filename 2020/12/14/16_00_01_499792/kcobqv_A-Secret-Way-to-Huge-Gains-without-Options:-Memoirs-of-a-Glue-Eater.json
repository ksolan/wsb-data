Heaven knows that some of you with an IQ of a doorknob are sitting pretty on white sand beaches with your meme gains. And others among you who are much smarter than I\u2019ll ever be can wield your contracts better than I can tie my shoelaces. You\u2019re deadly and I salute you. I\u2019m writing this for the fraction of you that know you need leverage to escape the life of a cubicle jockey but constantly find your pockets empty because of high IV and theta. There\u2019s another way. Use warrants. So, full disclosure, I\u2019m no Mr. Miyagi when it comes to this type of trading since I\u2019ve only been doing it for the last year, but it has worked well for me and I can save you the trouble of making the same mistakes I did. If you already know how warrants work, skip the first section.\n\n**What is a warrant and why should I care?** \n\nThey\u2019re like baby calls that theta can\u2019t kill you on over the course of a few months. It\u2019s like an agreement you make with a company that just started publicly trading. Each time you purchase a warrant, you now have the right to someday buy one share of common stock AT the price specified in the warrant contract (strike price) regardless of what the common stock is trading at. But the catch is the common stock has to be more valuable than the strike price before the warrant contract expires or your warrant is now worthless. The time period before expiration is usually 5 years after they were issued. As the common stock increases in value, the value of the warrant increases at a much faster pace. Also, because each warrant is so cheap, you can buy a lot of them to give you a huge amount of leverage. \n\n**Example:** I buy XXXX\u2019s warrant which is called XXXXW at a price of .25 cents each. The common stock (XXXX) is trading at 4.50 at the moment. If the common stock ever becomes more valuable than 11.50 plus the price I paid for each warrant (.25 cents), I am in the green as long as it happens within the next 5 years. So say XXXX\u2019s common stock is 20.75 at the end of 5 years, I only pay 11.75 for each share. So assuming I exercised the warrant myself instead of selling it at its now much higher price to someone else, I make a profit of 9.00 for every 25 cent warrant I bought. If I bought a lot of them, it adds up incredibly fast. But just like an options contract, most people don\u2019t exercise the warrant contracts themselves. They bought them early and will sell them way before the contract expires regardless if it\u2019s in the money or out of the money because of the extra value that the remaining time gives it.\n\n**The 2 Strategies That Have Worked for Me**\n\n**Strategy** **1: Buy the Hidden Gems** \n\nA company has publicly traded warrants because they are brand new. The story that you will see over and over again is this. A SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisitions Company) finds a company they want to merge with. The SPAC gets hyped to the moon as people wait for the date when the SPAC merges with their bride to be. The merger date finally comes and the newly formed company begins to trade on its own ticker. The ticker is immediately decimated as the original investors leave as soon as they can to take advantage of the hype. Most ex-SPAC\u2019s deserve this. Their balance sheets are uglier than a hairy ass and most will likely never make it even close to the 11.50 trading price. But this is not true for all. There are some discarded diamonds. \n\nIf you have the patience to look at the first earnings report for each ex-SPAC that just fell out of the nest, you could find tickers with solid revenue and a long runway of growth in front of them for pennies. Multiply your gains by buying warrants aggressively on those companies instead of buying their common stock. If people catch on that your company is on a good trajectory, you could be selling that .25 cent warrant you just bought for upwards of 1.00 in a few months, maybe even 5.00 in a couple years. If you like to gamble you can even buy warrants on a ticker that hasn\u2019t had its first earnings report as a new company (provided you love everything you\u2019ve found out through your research). Odds are that sentiment has reached the bottom of the barrel if you catch the ex-SPAC in this period. In my experience, this works best when you look at the least-sexy ex-SPACs. If you bet on warrants for a meme EV SPAC, you might be slapping your forehead soon. Running through Marketwatch\u2019s warrant index once a week and researching any new ones, might lead you to a 100 bagger before it\u2019s on anyone\u2019s radar. \n\n**Strategy 2: Tender Offer Arbitrage** \n\nWhen an ex-SPAC is aggressive about preventing dilution or really needs cash, they might do what\u2019s called a tender offer on their warrants. This offer is almost always a great deal to the warrant holders. If it\u2019s a cashless exchange, they will offer you a partial common stock for every warrant you turn into them. If the majority of warrant holders agree to the deal, you now get common shares at a steal and the company limits the effect of dilution. This is at the expense of the people that were holding commons since their shares will be worth a little less. Usually the news is enough to drop the commons significantly and shoot the warrants up. If it\u2019s an overreaction, warrant holders get an even better deal since commons will likely return to their old baseline once the exchange happens and people realize it was unnecessarily beat down. For some reason, you can often find warrants trading at say .25 cents when you can trade them in for a partial common stock that\u2019s worth .50 cents. It may be because people are afraid the warrant holders will vote no or they\u2019re too lazy to understand the tender offer, but it gives you a great window to profit. \n\n**What to Avoid:** \n\n* Ex-SPACs usually have a very low float and are incredibly susceptible to both positive and negative swings due to news. Their warrants are even more volatile. You guys are no strangers to volatility but it\u2019s not easy to day trade them because there is usually a large spread between bid and ask. \n* If you take away one thing from what I say, I want it to be this. Both SPACs and ex-SPACs are plagued with people ready to pump and dump. Trying to momentum trade a meme pump and dump in warrants usually doesn\u2019t end well. When I first started doing this, I got burned every time I tried so be skeptical of any ticker you start hearing about often. \n* There\u2019s no way around it. You have to go through the quarterly reports. At the very least, understand how to read their balance sheets. It might be the most valuable hour of youtube you spend in your life. Be careful of any ticker with a shitload of \u201cGoodwill.\u201d It\u2019s almost always a placeholder. When bad news comes out, warrants take steep dives. If you find yourself holding bags but you feel your initial analysis was solid, just hold for a few months. Odds are you\u2019ll be pissed you didn\u2019t wait to see your warrants react to a positive catalyst. Meme warrants sometimes don\u2019t come back at all though if they were hugely overvalued. \n* On the rare occasion that you strike gold and catch a warrant before others do, it might take some time for it to be discovered. It will be painful just watching it gather dust but the rewards of when it takes off are worth it. I\u2019ve only been in this game for a year but I know some seasoned warrant veterans that have essentially become overnight millionaires from looking where no one else would.\n*  Make sure you understand the terms of the warrants. Although the majority have a 5 year contract and are a 1 to 1 trade at a strike price of 11.50, not all of them are. Some warrants are weird with a 2:1 trade and require you to basically use 2 warrants to exercise. \n\n**TLDR: Be a financial Lewis & Clark.
