{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "By 2030, 50-60% of the cars on the road with be Teslas. 90% of the EV's on the road will be Teslas.\n\nThere will be more hype in Tesla models then there ever has been in any other car maker. Tesla will be the iPhone of cars in terms of demand, and Tesla will completely dominate the EV market from 2025 - 2030. Why you ask?\n\nCompetitor's battery tech is so far behind Tesla, that in order to sell an EV at a competitive price in the next 5 years they'd have to sell their EVs at a loss. All the while, autombile manufacturers that rely on combustion engines will be losing sales to the EV market, and if they did put out an EV (not even likely at a positive margin), they'd only be cannibalizing their combustion engine sales. Tesla will easily dominate the EV market in the next 5 years. And by dominate, I mean obliterateuntil they're practically the only EVs on the road.\n\nEven if competitors did sell an EV at a comparable price to Tesla models. Why would anyone buy them when Tesla is the only company in the world that has software for autonomous driving? Tesla will dominate the autonomous driving market until 2035 or 2040 and probably far beyond. The only company that can catch up to the self-driving technology that TSLA has, and then not be too chickenshit to actually start implementing it might be Alphabet... and maybe Apple? But guess what? They don't make cars. Maybe they can sell it to Nissan when Nissan finally catches up in battery technology by 2040? or 2050?.. and also redesign their Leaf to not look stupid as shit? There you go Tesla bears.. I threw you a bone.\n\nTesla's EVs make 40% margin. If autonomous driving is added on as a subscription, then Tesla will make back the cost of the car and then some in only 5 years or so. Robo taxis will be paying Tesla indefinitely.. many many times the actual cost of the car. This gives plenty of incentive for Tesla to create cars that actually last 300k - 500k miles. Creating cars that last 500k miles would reduce operating costs and the need to keep building factories and spitting out worthless cars at a crazy pace the way Ford and Toyota do. Yay for the environment too! Tesla might even consider selling cars at a lower margin.. 20% if they knew that you'd be buying subscriptions to autonomous driving (maybe a contract agreement?). This will further the domination of the EV market. Eventually Tesla will have millions of cars on the road, with the drivers subscribed to self driving and the money will just pour in. ABSOLUTE. MARKET. DOMINATION. All the while, other car companies might be getting caught up in battery tech to sell a $30k car but \\*holds in laughter\\* Tesla will sell you a car at only $20k if you agree to a year of an autonomous driving subscription!\n\nNow why would anyone buy a Nissan Leaf when you can have a Tesla for $30k (or $20k with a year of autonomous driving! pay as you go!) that actually lasts for a couple decades? By the way, value Tesla Customer! Don't forget to sign in on the app and buy a month of autonomous driving for your road trip next summer!\n\nTesla will start selling car insurance as well. Make any modifications you need to your car insurance policy through the app. You can be as granular as adding collision for a few months, or comprehensive while you're on vacation and worried where you might need to park. But don't worry investors, Tesla won't be swindled on the cutomizable car insurance.. they know how you drive.. they have the data.. a loooot of data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy 2035 or 2040, Tesla will be \\*the\\* name associated with all your automobile needs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy price target: $2800/share by 2026. That's a $2.65T cap.\n\nAdditional external things to help make this price target a reality:\n\nInflation going up per JPow's goal of \"averaging\" 2% a year (any year where consumers struggle will usually result in a lower than 2% inflation.. giving free rein on the money printer button), big money putting their big money into assets for the next few years at least to avoid the higher than 2% inflation.\n\nETFs create bubbles. In my opinion, not the bad kind of bubbles. The kind of bubble where companies are valued much greater than a traditional valuation because noobs are buying the fuck out of SPY. Guess who gets to join the \"I'm buying you because I don't understand stocks!\" party?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy positions:\n\nFirst, I bought a March 2021 $1920 the day of the split announcement for $23k. This is largely what funded my current positions:\n\n73 shares\n\nSept $420c\n\nMy idea:\n\nI will likely put all $75k of my portfolio into TSLA shares and/or LEAPS, and make regular semi-monthly contributions (24 times a year) of about $625 ($15k annually) for the next 5 years straight into shares. In moments of relatively lower volatility or a stupid low dip, I might sell some shares to buy ITM LEAPS calls, and vice versa after a pump.. once hitting a 100-200% gain on the LEAPS, sell it and put it back into shares. Essentially, maintain a decent delta on the ride to $2800. Sell the occasional covered call, but be careful and patient as fuck to get a ridiculously high strike that's pumped as hell. Just these last couple weeks you could sell a $1000 strike for a few hundred dollars. Put covered call premiums into more TSLA shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've done the math. Assumptions:\n\nTSLA going straight up to $2800 linearly to the beginning of 2026\n\n$75k initial investment in shares. $625 semi-monthly contributions up to 2026 (additional $15k\\*5=$75k in contributions for $150k total)\n\nNo consideration of leveraging with LEAPS and no consideration of selling covered calls\n\nThis will yield $640k in Jan 2026.\n\nA lower target of $2000/share yields $435k in Jan 2026.\n\nLink to the math: [https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=let+a+%3D+%281%2Br%2F24%29%3B+let+r+%3D+.355%3B+let+n+%3D+24\\*5%3B+p%3D75000\\*a%5En%2B625\\*%28%28a%5En-1%29%2F%28a-1%29%29](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=let+a+%3D+%281%2Br%2F24%29%3B+let+r+%3D+.355%3B+let+n+%3D+24*5%3B+p%3D75000*a%5En%2B625*%28%28a%5En-1%29%2F%28a-1%29%29)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReasons I might make more:\n\nProper use of LEAPS calls as stock replacement\n\nselling occasional covered calls successfully\n\nTSLA dipping a lot, so as long as it eventually hits the target price. This will cause my semi-monthly contributions to \"buy low.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReasons I might make less:\n\nfucking up with a covered call\n\nTSLA hitting target before 2026, this would cut back on the number of contributions I can make prior to the target and my contributions would be \"buying high.\" But this would be a good problem to have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: TSLA to $2800 by 2026.

If they find a successful solution they can bring these technologies onto every price range of car. \nThey can merge their capital to develop one technology which they can share between the brands while not having to develop the car itself. </p>\n\n<p>Tesla is completely overvalued which is why I also think that it&#39;s a good investment for the next few years</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kd0f5n/why_tsla_will_be_a_265t_company_by_2026/gftqy5s/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_gftqy5s", "created": 1607993294.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1607964494.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "replies": []}, {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_kd0f5n", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gftnmze", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": {"name": "Inori92", "fullname": "t2_75n6f"}, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gftndat", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_75n6f", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "collapsed": false, "body": "Zoox stream coming up in 45 minutes\n\nBB and VLDR about to print", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Zoox stream coming up in 45 minutes</p>\n\n<p>BB and VLDR about to print</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kd0f5n/why_tsla_will_be_a_265t_company_by_2026/gftnmze/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_gftnmze", "created": 1607991673.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1607962873.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "replies": []}, {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_kd0f5n", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gftnym8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": {"name": "gravityCaffeStocks", "fullname": "t2_4vtqk2e5"}, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gftndat", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_4vtqk2e5", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "collapsed": false, "body": ">they don\u2019t have reliable self-driving technology\n\nYes they do.
