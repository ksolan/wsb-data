Like all of you, I did not take one fucking minute out of my life to do the simplest DD you could think of. Let's look at the previous two console cycles for Gamestop. \n\nThe ps3 and xbox360 got released on november 11, 2006 and november 22, 2005. Gamestop peaked afterwards around December 7, 2007. Indeed, console cycle would have made you some nice money here. But people are not fucking retarded. We are not DD gods for figuring this out. My grandmother's dead chihuahua could have figured this out, in fact she probably did. \n\nSo what happens in the next console cycle, with the ps4 released on November 13, 2013 and the Xbox one on November 22, 2013? Gamestop started mooning around January 2013, peaking on November 8, 2013. BEFORE the release. Let alone earnings. \n\nNow when did Gamestop start mooning again? End of August this year. In fact, it went from approximately 4 dollars a share to a high of around 20, a short while after the release of the consoles. Non-idiots bought a long time ago, sold for profit. This company is only going down. \n\nBut what about Cohen? Remember that he bought quite a while ago and has a nice profit already. In his position, why not sell? Of course he could still takeover, which is not a guarantee that this company will do good in the future in any way. What is he going to do after most consoles are sold? People are buying their games digitally. The biggest profits from gaming are not anymore buying games, it's buying stuff in games such as Fortnite, League of Legends and Counterstrike. Something Gamestop will never be able to profit from.\n\nOh btw, Scion capital, that Autist named Burry's company, sold over 30 % off their share in November.\n I will probably sell my stock tomorrow for a huge loss.
