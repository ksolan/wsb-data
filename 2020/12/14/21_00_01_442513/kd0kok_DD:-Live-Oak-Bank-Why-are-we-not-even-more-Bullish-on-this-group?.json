The Bank says they are a tech company that operates as a bank. This is 100% true. A software IPO that came out this year was nCino. You know who basically created nCino? LOB. Thats right, Chip Mahan and Neil Underwood were behind nCino and i think still have some investment individually in nCino. nCino is a full on massive Commercial Lending and Bank Operating system that uses Salesforce as a backend database essentially.

Apiture is an independent entity and just raised $20 million.  They are going to be one of the first online banking systems to take advantage of the new \"Open banking\" and API capabilities. (seriously banking is so outdated).\n\nThere is a core system that Canapi is invested in (does the GL work of the bank) that i have no idea if Live Oak will use it but my guess would be yes if it works.
