{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Hello my good autist friend, hope you're well. After seeing the Godfather [Vito](https://www.reddit.com/user/vitocorlene/) post a [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kcqkax/steel_stocks_getting_ready_for_lift_off/?sort=new) about steel I started hyperventilating. The TLDR; version of Vito's DD is: **Steel demand is VERY high and supply is VERY low.** Go and read the DD as the guy has worked in the industry for a long time and clearly knows what he is talking about.\n\nNow I ain't no fucking economist, I'm just a wall street autist, but I do know that there's a \"supply and demand\" economic law. Take a look at the graph below, friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[IF SUPPLY IS LOW THEN PRICE IS HIGH.](https://preview.redd.it/5wqrmndx28561.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=27d7a692a167a2a5b0c84d32311afef607e033c6)\n\nSo now that I refreshed your memory about supply and demand, let's go back in time.\n\nIt's 2008, steel is at an all time high. How high? Well the highest exporter of steel in the world as of 2019 $MT reached a wooping $245.53 on 6th of July 2008 before plumetting harder than $SPCE today because supply finally caught up with the demand.\n\nNow I know you have many quesitons.. Why the fuck was it so high, yet today it's trading at $20?Why does my wife hate me? What happened in 2008???\n\nGo read this article or just read the TLDR. But notice that this article was written in FEBRUARY 2008, 4 MONTHS BEFORE $MT reached an all time high of $250-ish..\n\n[https://uk.reuters.com/article/businesspro-steel-prices-dc/global-steel-prices-the-sky-is-the-limit-idUSL0887074020080225](https://uk.reuters.com/article/businesspro-steel-prices-dc/global-steel-prices-the-sky-is-the-limit-idUSL0887074020080225)\n\nTLDR;\n\n\\-Demand for steel remains high, although the Western economies just collapsed.-Coal prices SOAR. Coal is one of the main ingredients in steel production.-Exports from China fall, causing steel prices to MOON in Europe.-Experts predict steel price will continue to rise.\n\nRememeber the points above as we return to today.\n\nSo what's the situation right now? Vito summed it up best in his post \"There is not relief in sight and many steel mills are having to purchase raw materials - iron ore and scrap at prices not seen since 2008.\"\n\nShoutout to [SteveMcHeave](https://www.reddit.com/user/SteveMcHeave/) for linking me to the [trading economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/steel-production) page where you can view each countries output of steel by month. If you Google \"top 10 producers of steel\", then view each countries steel production month by month, you will see that all major producers of steel are still at pre-covid levels of production except for China.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[USA STEEL PRODUCTION \\(ALL COUNTRIES LOOK VERY SIMILAR TO THIS GRAPH\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7g5vcesr68561.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2b845a09690b683515c3375c5e37891cb3e4744)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[CHINA CAN'T SUPPLY THE WHOLE WORLD](https://preview.redd.it/mpnxbgc678561.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=312025b269d0ecdb136f54abe62b00e289ca920c)\n\nSteel mills are just starting back up and will probably reach pre-covid levels by end of year. I'm sure these mills have quite a few orders backloged because covid caused logistical issues. Suppliers couldn't deliver goods as countries shut their borders, local outbreaks at factories forced people to self isolate, etc, etc. And to add more fuel to the fire of DEMAND, vaccine news will allow world economies to start pumping again. Projects that are due to start in 2021 will begin and so will the demand for steel.\n\nOkay one final thing.. COAL. Remember in 2008 how the price of coal soared by 65%?\n\nRead [this article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/iron-ore-futures-top-150-as-china-demand-fuels-late-year-surge)  TLDR;-$Vale lowers its target for iron delivery due to the dam disaster it had earlier. Vale is the second largest importer of iron to China.-Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley say coal prices will continue to be higher than usual into next year.-Australias bank says \"If you chill the fuck out, mate, and reduce your steel production, coal will go back to normal prices\". Probably won't happen as demand in west is starting to increase-Australias bad weather is causing supply issues.\n\nNow you will probably go and do some more DD and see that China's steel mills have recently asked their governing bodies to investigate the price of coal coming in from Australia. I don't think this will have much of an impact on coal because the demand is high and the supply is dropping, prices are bound to increase. China started a trade war with Australia and banned a load of Australian imports, so things will only get more interesting from here.\n\nAs long as the supply is behind the demand, the price of steel will continue to rise. As price of steel continues to rise, so will the profits of the steel producers. God speed to you and I shall see you in tendy town. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**TLDR;**\n\n[READ THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kcqkax/steel_stocks_getting_ready_for_lift_off/?sort=new)Steel price will rise as supply tries to catch up with the demand. The original DD who inspired this post thinks $MT will rise signlificantly over the next 8-12 weeks.\n\n1. Buy $MT / Arcelor Mittal as they are the biggest supplier of steel in the world as of 2019\n2. Buy Schnitzer Steel - Big recycler stonk\n3. Buy $Vale - VALE GANG!! Iron miner stonk\n\nPersonally I'm all in on $MT. This shit could hit $60 by next year. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "author_fullname": "t2_6ivgw901", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "STEEL
