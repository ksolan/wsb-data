If you ever had an iPhone or PlayStation 3-5, or watched a San Diego Chargers game you've probably been impacted by Atlas Air.

The company anticipates solid volumes in the fourth quarter, driven by continued e-commerce growth. They recently made a deal with Alibaba (BABA) to send their consumer's merchandise to South America and  allowing them to grow operations there.\n\n The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.69. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.53. Their biggest competitor is Air Transport Services group (ATSG) who even though has a bigger market cap, higher P/E ratio of 15.97, also happens to have a smaller fleet then Atlas Air and does not have the 747-800 which is the newest model of the 747 and most fuel efficient while carrying more weight which in this industry is crucial and helps them stand out from their competitors.  \n\n A resistance level has formed in the chart of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc.\u00a0 If this level is crossed, a breakout could occur.  \n\nAAWW saw strong earnings and revenue growth in the third quarter with earnings up 667.6% year over year and revenue up 24.9%. The stock is trading at a low valuation with a Price to Sales ratio of 0.5 and a Price to Book ratio of 0.7.\n\nThe company\u2019s cash position for the third quarter was $718 million, up from $72 million in the same quarter last year. Though that is considerably lower than its long-term debt of $2.4 Billion. AAWW has shown strong long-term momentum, but is down over the short-term. \n\n AAWW has formed an important level to watch at the $57.50 (blue) mark shown below on the chart. That level was supported back in September and October, and now it has become resistance after the stock fell below it. Although it appears the stock might be headed lower, a break back above $57.50 likely means higher prices for AAWW. \n\n Therefore you guys could enter a long position on a break above the resistance level with a protective stop placed under it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yzprbsuie9561.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&s=08142d1be63721c347d9ba4d66536690f3ecffc8\n\n There are multiple catalysts that could cause this stock to break out. \n\nThe first one is the fact that the company is being apart of the vaccine distribution and is expected for the next year to help distribute the vaccine because their aircraft can support and hold the refrigerators to carry the vaccines since they have to be kept cold. \n\nSecond catalyst. Atlas Air has a partnership with amazon where amazon leases their fleet to transport all their shit all over the world. With the epidemic and amazon growing like crazy this has only lead Atlas Air to grow. Amazon has warrants to buy up to 23% of the company by end of 2023. And its Christmas and I have a feeling Christmas records for Amazon are about to be shattered which means Atlas Air will be busy. Also typically around Christmas through February the stock has a history of being at it's highest for the year around that time because it is their busiest season.\n\nThird catalyst. Growth. Atlas Air is adding to its fleet and is hiring more pilots to tackle the tasks at hand. Also passenger airlines typically when doing international trips hold additional cargo in their hull to make more profits, but with less international flights due to Covid Atlas Air has had growth in customers asking them to hull freight. And assuming Atlas Air does good with these customers and makes them happy their clientele should expect to grow.  \n\nForth catalyst. Gasoline is pretty cheap, even though it is rising in price with vaccine news, it is still much cheaper then previously before for aircraft.\n\nFifth Catalyst maybe? As the coronavirus chaos is beginning to come to an end and super sexy overvalued tech companies are no longer as attractive this can lead to an emphasis on value and funds will be longer for their next growth prospects and this provides opportunity for value and growth and a way to capitalize off the coronavirus vaccine, amazon holiday season, and a ever changing world. \n\nTo summarize, this is a well ran growing company and the stock price is poised for a breakout with a combination of these catalysts. The company is no where near its all time high yet it is the best it has ever been financially. The company is also owned over 90% by institutional investors so there is lots of smart money in the company who recognize value and the next earnings report is in February and this company tends to have a run up towards earnings. \n\nLiterally Can't go tits up. \n\nI wrote this instead of taking my macroeconomics exam so I hope you enjoyed it. \n\nPositions\n\n\\-57.50 1/15 Calls\n\n\\-Will look to acquire more February calls once initial breakout occurs going into earnings run-up. \n\nSources:\n\n[https://stocknews.com/news/aaww-atlas-air-worldwide-holdings-ready-to-breakout/](https://stocknews.com/news/aaww-atlas-air-worldwide-holdings-ready-to-breakout/)\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-value-investors-buy-atlas-air-worldwide-aaww-stock-2020-12-14](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-value-investors-buy-atlas-air-worldwide-aaww-stock-2020-12-14)", "author_fullname": "t2_51vrhbzy", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Vaccine Distribution, Christmas Profits, and technical analysis that poises opportunity for breakout .", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 80, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "media_metadata": {"21fcmxahb9561": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 61, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/21fcmxahb9561.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=398f5e455aa5e68114e8ff3c6c88ca475b0e1578"}, {"y": 123, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/21fcmxahb9561.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=803a3d10a2d29d1c6ba2f8c66bc13893e4f1d084"}, {"y": 183, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/21fcmxahb9561.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=707e708e4499c20bfa02a63ed4b641469bbc7e37"}, {"y": 366, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/21fcmxahb9561.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=837f7b70a277314edb8e79a9fe76571012c3caa9"}, {"y": 549, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/21fcmxahb9561.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=feb83f31537d422fffb10e1cbb48598b5ee14f02"}, {"y": 618, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/21fcmxahb9561.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=422f92074bd209b035c89bb80753ffac537d2daf"}], "s": {"y": 1099, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/21fcmxahb9561.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6072d3f0ec86050ac1dc2ea0ffb802c61b4b110"}, "id": "21fcmxahb9561"}, "yzprbsuie9561": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 80, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yzprbsuie9561.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=984657d88f051e7f45547c33b948d9313a453ad8"}, {"y": 160, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yzprbsuie9561.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=1d5eaa7ce3d95083f3e9b194a5897d05cb87dfa4"}, {"y": 237, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yzprbsuie9561.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=7c04c6f6841f3a7057c5e8e6ad0a2d6a8ad8e088"}, {"y": 475, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yzprbsuie9561.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ecd90bd7b35a1636c5dbc4b18d321d6eaac936b4"}], "s": {"y": 569, "x": 766, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yzprbsuie9561.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&s=08142d1be63721c347d9ba4d66536690f3ecffc8"}, "id": "yzprbsuie9561"}}, "name": "t3_kdcy1c", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/m1UkM9q55m7xAgTBglcazeNIHG4EOrIPdgyA-cqIDdQ.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1608028799.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello Fellow Autists, I have an opportunity I wish to present to you that. </p>\n\n<p>The company is Atlas Air (AAWW).
