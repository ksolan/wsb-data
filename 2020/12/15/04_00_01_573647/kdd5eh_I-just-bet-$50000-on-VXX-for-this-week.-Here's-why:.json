I foresee them waiting on the bill until Feb or so and then assessing the situation then. \n3. GA Runoff looking more and more like it could go to both Dems. Trump complaining about it. If both dems get seat then we have a 50-50 senate and deciding vote is Kamala.

Now that we have vaccine and things are going back to normal, people are going to use their money to buy things to impress their neighbors, as well as have experiences and travel instead of putting everything into the market as they've been doing for the past 9 months simply because there hasn't been anything to buy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of these could go the other way of course as well, but for now they look like they are pointing down.
