{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Hey team, some quick helpful tips on how to do options when a stock IPOs, and a couple of FAQs that come up from time to time:\n\n1: When a stock IPOs, there's no options for at least three (3) business days. The CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange) do this because they want to make sure the stock price has kind of stabilized and they can have an idea of how to price the options (figuring out how all those Greeks are going to go).\n\n2: When options first open, it's like the fucking beaches of Normandy on D-Day. You've seen the movies.  Be real careful. The doors to the landing crafts open, and the first round of autists pile onto the beach with their ridiculous shitcalls, only to get torn to shreds in a hail of gunfire. That's the opening scene of your Tendie Termination. Low Open Interest means the market hasn't figured out how to price the options yet (least of all you), so the Bid/Ask spreads are gaped out worse than when that Chad of a boyfriend is done with your wife. You'll cross B/A spreads that make up 25-50% of the value of the option - meaning you might need to double your value just to break even. It's a rough scene.\n\n3: Market makers like round numbers, which makes higher open interest and closer B/A spreads - you save money on a more mature market. For example, look at PLTR May 21 '21 $30c vs. the $31c: The $30c have a B/A spread of $6.10 to $6.45 - a 35 cent spread (about 5%) - by comparison, the $31c have a spread of 5.50 to 6.55 - a $1.05 spread (or\\~16%!). The $31 may look cheaper, but in reality you're getting a shittier deal of crossing that massive B/A.\n\n4: OTM Call Options typically don't go higher than either 50% or 100% of the underlying stock's highest value. I've written letters to CBOE begging and pleading for more, and they won't do it. Look at Tesla - it's ATH was $654, and the highest its options can go is $1200 (at least until Daddy Elon Tweets a pic of him and Alex Karp docking together and moons both stocks to $6969.420).\n\nTL;DR: Don't pile into the IPO unless you're terminally ill and hate your grandkids. Don't buy Options on the day they're first available. Buy round numbers to get a better bargain.\n\nPositions: An irresponsibly large amount $SHLDQ options on the fourth business day of trading, probably in January by the look of it.\n\nRef: [https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/072104.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/072104.asp)", "author_fullname": "t2_7802gl65", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Identifying ROADBLOCKS to getting IPO Options Tendies", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Fundamentals"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "fundamentals", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kd9nar", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Fundamentals", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 1}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1608018104.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey team, some quick helpful tips on how to do options when a stock IPOs, and a couple of FAQs that come up from time to time:</p>\n\n<p>1: When a stock IPOs, there&#39;s no options for at least three (3) business days.
