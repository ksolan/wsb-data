{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "TL;DR SNOW falls in the winter dum dum\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright I don't need to explain this to you because I already know you stopped reading and/or can't read, but I'll leave it here:\n\n(1) SNOW is going to fall because of valuation compression\n\nSeven months ago in private, series G funding SNOW had a valuation of $12.4B. Now, it's market capitalization is $93.2B. That's 750% of it's value in February OF THIS YEAR. You don't care. Fine. SNOW's TTM gross profit. What? Yeah I'll explain. TTM is trailing twelve months, and gross profit is what they sold their shit for minus how much it cost to make the shit. TTM gross profit is about $300M.   How much shit they sell (revenue) and how much it costs to make the shit (cost of revenue) grow together at about the same rate. So gross profit is the number we care about. This isn't even factoring is how much it costs to SELL the actual shit (operating expense). Shit-SELLING costs don't scale as much as shit-MAKING costs (FYI, this quarter shit-selling cost $750M so the company lost about $450M). They are increasingly selling more shit. More people want their shit. In fact, in a year, they sold \\~120% more shit. You might think Frank \"Coochie Man\" Slootman is gunna take this baby to the moon, but that'll happen in late March and April. Let's assume that SNOW delivers godlike revenue numbers. Grows 100% year over year (hard to sustain as numbers get larger). Let's also assume shit-making cost growth at 100% and they're VERY VERY efficient so shit-selling grows less 50% (size efficiencies). Pretty sure these are impossible numbers. Okay.. so next year gross profit (shit sold minus shit-making cost) is $600M, and $1.125B. Loss of $525M. 2 years: gross profit $1.2B and cost $1.6875B. Loss of $487.5M. 3 years: gross profit $2.4B and cost $2.53125B for a loss of $131.25M. In this ABSURD model (in which they don't pay any interest on debt), they lose over a billion in 12 quarters before becoming profitable in the 13th quarter from now. That doesn't even factor in the fact that costs came in far above analyst expectations this quarter, so it's likely they can't suppress cost growth. But who cares about the valuation? NO ONE. NOT WARMAN BUFFLORD.\n\n(2) In the short term, SNOW will fall because of lockup expiry.\n\nIk you guys know this already but I dug into the details. I'm talking SEC S1 IPO registration, I'm talking alternative minimum tax structure, I'm talking public float breakdown. So, first of all. Lockup expiry #1 is today. Employees and former employees under the title of VP can sell 25% of holdings. Will they? Almost definitely yes. This lockup is tiny and represents about 1.3M shares. The total public float is around 30M shares. But average volume is around 8M so we can guarantee that today about 1.3M of that 8M will be selling pressure. Why will they definitely sell? If they wait past December 31st of this year, they get locked into the alternative minimum tax, wherein the difference between market and strike of their options is treated as income and taxed as such at 26 or 28%. It's much cheaper to sell shares at the long-term capital gains rate for their tax bracket (employees under VP probably get like 20% cuz they make in between 150K and 200K a year in income). But WAIT-- won't they get SHORT-term capital gains rate? No. The vast majority of employees and non-employees have option incentive packages (ISOs) and restricted stock units (RSUs) from the inception of the company in 2012. It's cheaper tax-wise to exercise options as soon as they vest, and the vesting (waiting) period is typically 2 years. So everyone has been exercising their options and turning them into shares. These shares if they're more than 1 year since exercise are long term capital gains. So any ISOs given to employees before 2017 are guaranteed to be exercised and long-term classified. The S1 filing itself says that as of July 31st 2020, 25% of the holdings of employees and former employees were stock (NOT options). So it's very likely that stock has been held over a year and is ready to be sold. BUT THAT'S ONLY THE START. Next if the share price stays over 133% of IPO ($160), which it will, for 10 trading days of 15 trading days following December 15th, Venture Capitalists can sell 25% of holdings. This represents an S-load more shares than the pesky employees, and the VC have the huge incentive to sell and lock in the high price of snow on their 25% before the general selloff that will result from the god-tier lockup expiry in late Feb/early March. Two trading days after SNOW files their form 10K with the SEC for annual results, the rest of all shares will be available to sell. That will boost public float from 30M to 300M. YIKES. This imminent selling pressure will (a) drive the price down more after the 10K, but also (b) it provides the massive incentive for VC and employees to sell their 25% stakes that are unlocked earlier (today and in early January).\n\nAll in all, SNOW will see continued pressure through mid January. The only hope for a small rally is between mid-January and mid-February (after first two mini-lockup expiries but before the god-tier expiry). But after that the selloff in anticipation of total lockup expiry will take over. These lockups will drop price because it's not like SNOW is undervalued rn. It's financial valuation is massively overweight, so there's cheap-buying justification for people to pick up shares and create public demand. There will only be selling pressure.\n\nFull disclosure, I have about $4K of SNOW puts.
