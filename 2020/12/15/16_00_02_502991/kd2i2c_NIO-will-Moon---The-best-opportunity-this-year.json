{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Tl;dr - NIO is a generational investment opportunity. Buy the dip ya fools!!!   \nTake this DD from your neighborhood genius asian man and friend of WSB. \n\nChina's Domestic Issues:  \n\\-Car ownership is rising in the millions as the middle class income is rising along with its soaring population. So is China's air pollution problem--a huge issue and international embarrassment.   \n\\-China is the world's 4th largest oil producer, behind the United States. This is not enough oil for China's voracious demand, so they must import tons of barrels from OPEC nations. Of course, they don't want to rely on them. Who does? Will they go to war with them like the US has done in the past twenty years? NO! Because the Chinese want to rely on a more tech-driven solution. \n\nEV's. Nio is an answer to many of China's problems. With battery swap technology making battery charging more affordable and faster for the driver, Nio's EV ecosystem will net billions of dollars from China alone. EV's used to be for the rich. NIO will increasingly make cars affordable for the middle class. Also, imagine if GE or Toyota made money off \"fuel\" in addition to selling their cars. That's what NIO will do with their subscription-based charging stations. \n\nInternational Upside:  \n\\-Why do you think China accepted Tesla into their country and not other businesses like Amazon, Google, or Facebook? Well, they say there's no free lunch. China wants to sell their cars to the United States. China also wants to set up EV charging stations throughout the US as Tesla will do in China--this is the next gas station business. Imagine Standard Oil level income for NIO!!!   \n\\-If the US doesn't agree with Nio, then China will say, \"bye bye Tesla\".   \n\\-Europe is a lock. NIO has offices in UK and Germany. Like it or not, Europe is swayed by China's money in a way that the US is still not. \n\nComparables:  \n\\-If you wanna see how China will do in the future, look no further than Japan and South Korea. Very similar in every respect. Japan thrived after it transitioned from an agrarian economy to a manufacturing one, of cheap electronics and cars. Then it transitioned into making quality products, right after they hosted the summer Olympics, like Sony, Toshiba, Toyota, etc. It was made possible due to the Japanese people's industriousness, denial of self, national pride, and quite frankly, Asian smarts.   \n\\-Similar thing happened in South Korea--transitioned from making rice to making cheap manufacturing of electronics and cars. Like Japan, they're now in the process of making quality products--the surge also happening after around the time they hosted the Summer Olympics in '88. Think Samsung's phones. Think higher-end Sonatas, or LG flat screen TV's.   \n\\-China? China has been a manufacturing powerhouse since the 2000s. But millennial sand boomers should remember all the cheap \"Made in China\" jokes. This image is slowly fading as China now has Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent making new innovations in AI and commerce. This again, happened after what? The 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.  \n\\-So where the hell are the Chinese cars? Where is China's Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, or Kia? \n\nNIO!!!! Unlike Toyota, Hyundai, etc. China's manufacturers can scale to levels no other country in the world has ever done in the past.\n\nNio will outgrow Tesla even if it doesn't make it to the United States. But Trump is no longer in office, and I doubt Biden will be capable of doing anything meaningful to stop Nio's rise. \n\nCEO Upside:  \n\\-William Li has a perfect track record. He took a failing Auto-Review company, invested in it with his own money and became its CEO. Within years, he IPO'd it on the NYSE, making himself and fellow investors billions of dollars.   \n\\-Forget Jack Ma, William is often called the Steve Jobs of China. That Elon Musk Battery Day flop? It will never happen with NIO. William has an immense eye for detail. He's a showman with the most anal high standards. In 2018, he got one of the Nio cars to talk about Bruno Mars and then had Bruno Mars frickin' show up on live stream to give a talk.\n\nNio is a steal in the $40 range. For you impatient ones, there'll be a catalyst in Nio Day coming up on Jan 9. But if you can buy leaps or hold shares long term, this will surpass 100 bucks for sure.\n\nBuy Nio.", "author_fullname": "t2_h6hq3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "NIO will Moon - The best opportunity this year", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kd2i2c", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 157, "total_awards_received": 3, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 157, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\u001b201007:33:1"}], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1607997096.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Tl;dr - NIO is a generational investment opportunity.
