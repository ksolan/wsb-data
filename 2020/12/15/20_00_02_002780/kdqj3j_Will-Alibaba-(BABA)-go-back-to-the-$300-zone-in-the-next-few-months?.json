BABA's momentum was killed and began to plummet. (I'm not gonna include a link, you can just google and find od articles on it)\n\n***Geopolitical Tension between China and India/ India's ban hammer***\n\nA few weeks after the Jack Ma speech that cucked BABA, India banned another 43 Chinese apps, including Alibaba's services such as Alipay, Aliexpress, etc. This news killed the recovering momentum that BABA had. (There are a lot of articles on it, you can just google them) \n\n***Delisting of Chinese Stocks***\n\nBarely a week after India's ban hammer on Chinese apps, which caused BABA to lose its gained momentum, the delisting of Chinese stocks added more uncertainty on BABA. However, we assume that it \"probably\" will not have any significant effects within the next few years.\n\n**PART I: TL;DR**\n\nBABA got fucked by three different governments continuously within a month.
