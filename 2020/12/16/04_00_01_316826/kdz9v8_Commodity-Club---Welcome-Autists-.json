{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "\\*\\*^(First Disclaimer)\\*\\*^(: This post is long. But it has lots of ugly graphs.)\n\nYou've probably seen a lot of posts recently about various commodities blowing up - first was silver gang, now steel gang. I'm here to tell you about a few more gangs, and also introduce you to the Commodity Club. [Welcome](https://tenor.com/oZx3.gif). Please add your insight and input.\n\n**^(Second)** ^(\\*\\*Disclaimer\\*\\*:)\n\n*I'm your 26 year old boomer autist who has religiously followed commodities since middle school (15+ years. I've played the ups (made lots and downs (lost lots of most commodities on the market and know there's others like me out there.) I'm here to tell you that no matter how you play commodities, you are about to make a lot of money.))*\n\nI have about $200k invested. I'm also not going to do any technical analysis for you - this is going to be introductory, and I'll let future members of the commodity club dive into the details.\n\n**Info**: If [this](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodities) isn't your internet home page, it's okay. I recommend you go to settings and quickly swap out Elon's twitter for commodities as your default home page.\n\nOne thing you'll notice on this lovely website is that it's color coded. I've purposely chosen this site for you retards over more technical sites because you can tell good (green) from bad (red). What you should immediately notice is that there's lots of green in the \"Monthly\" and \"YTD\" columns. If you did your own DD and went a layer deeper, you'd immediately notice graphs like the following:\n\n**1 Year Graphs:**\n\n[Copper](https://preview.redd.it/56o3ph98yf561.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0849d4f3272b6a1af40c1dbc0dc3c921c1e5bbb)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Steel](https://preview.redd.it/lxkbmkmbyf561.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ef4d544ec355cce6b54d1a2b9ed6c82711b315a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Nickel](https://preview.redd.it/m0zgjv5eyf561.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea312b593fde1b6174eb21abe02950439a730e4d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Zinc](https://preview.redd.it/xryrlt9gyf561.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd90a1c87507196fa000f817bb06b00737910515)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Coal](https://preview.redd.it/zyws1spqyf561.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=674e384c7c9b6cbc2adb089498f3300ab113b819)\n\n# STOP - Read!\n\nThe list goes on - Rubber, Lumber, Tin, Soybeans, Platinum, Propane, etc. Take a look for yourself to get the picture. Commodities go BOOM.\n\nHowever, unlike your normal stocks, commodities don't do a 1 year window. Cycles go for years - both booms and busts, and I'll give you a smattering of a few key commodities to illustrate that point.\n\n**10 Year Graphs:**\n\n[Copper 10 Year](https://preview.redd.it/zuz7xrr9zf561.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fe225b2a16159f05c4ac646c780da7ba9bdcf93)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Coal 10 Year](https://preview.redd.it/6c1qbhidzf561.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=8574c857c2abbfd4f6f66ce9745ee032d37e8b2a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Nickel 10 Year](https://preview.redd.it/mahxvv4gzf561.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=22a183a526ef2b1e966e76deaea45acf9738b1c3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Zinc 10 Year](https://preview.redd.it/8wthwnwizf561.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb964737fc948cf8c44e6ca8727eff550a16e020)\n\n# Those 1 year and 10 year graphs show a few key things:\n\n1. **Commodity cycles are rarely a flash in the pan**\n2. **Commodities are still undervalued**\n3. **Almost all commodities are trending up**\n\nYou would think that commodities going up would mean that commodity stocks are overvalued. I mean commodities in general are expensive now! Check out this Bloomberg commodity index to get an idea of how expensive commodities are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Commodity Index](https://preview.redd.it/0i3q4a2s0g561.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=aab4b35e1fbb7b2d8a93249e46937ac09f902ba7)\n\nWe are about 25% away from the peak! We can't zoom much further. Steel gang and Silver gang go bust. But wait - this is Commodity club and we are looking to make money. Why would this post be some gay bear shit.\n\nHere's a graph showing stock values between the S&P and Commodity Index (that thing you just learned about) since the 1970s:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[S&P vs Commodities ](https://preview.redd.it/n6jv4g531g561.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c2de80dac77c0640c323d4d4ba84daaa1e4d04b)\n\nWOW! The commodity index has never been so undervalued! What does this mean??\n\n^(\\*\\*Third disclaimer\\*\\*:)\n\n*I'm a firm believer that the world is entering the biggest commodity cycle we will ever know that will reset expectations on global commodity prices and last for at least a decade.*\n\n*What will drive this is a rapidly deteriorating global fiat currency (check your DXY charts* [*here*](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TVC-DXY/)*), low interest rates creating an incentive to grow and build, emerging economies like Brazil and India becoming net importers of commodities, China's rapid growth, a modernizing infrastructure (electric railroad/planes, wind turbine tankers, hyperloops, space travel), investment in EVs (and subsequently batteries) and the infrastructure to support it, and stumbling economies in need of increased stimulus through infrastructure spending.*\n\n*Supply and demand as we know it is about to swing massively, and you'll want to get in front of it. Commodities are what will bring us to new heights.*\n\nCommodity stocks are grossly undervalued compared to the spot price of their underlying commodities. There's a few definitions/key things you need to know:\n\n* Spot Price: The current market price at which an asset is bought or sold for immediate payment and deliver.\n* Futures Price: The prices at which an asset can be bought or sold for delivery in the future.\n* Commodity companies often sell futures to lock in prices at a known rate.\n* Miners often play multiple commodities.\n\n# Here's a few examples you've seen in recent WSB posts:\n\n* VALE ($17) - Brazilian miner who produces about 300 million tons of iron ore each year. They also produce Nickel.\n   * Iron ore futures currently trade at \\~ $150/ton. Last time iron ore futures were going into a bull market and hit $150/ton was in May 2010. VALE was trading in the $25-30 range.\n   * VALE just partially opened a previously closed mine to try to increase production to take advantage of prices.\n* MT ($23) - Indian steel producer who produces about 92 million tons of steel each year.\n   * Steel futures currently trade at \\~ $640/ton. Steel has traded at this level for the past 5 years where MT traded in the $20-40 range.\n   * This is not accounting for spot steel, which you've read about being much higher priced.\n\n# Here's a few examples you haven't seen in recent WSB posts:\n\n* TECK ($18) - Canadian Copper and Zinc miner with mines in Canada/Chile.\n   * Copper futures currently trade at \\~ $3.5/pound. Last time copper futures were going into a bull market and hit $3.5/pound, TECK hit $60 when copper ran up to $4.5/pound.\n   * Teck has great relationships with China and is opening one of the largest copper mines in the world next year.\n   * When copper hit $4/pound in 2010, TECK announced a $5/share special dividend.\n   * TECK is trading at a discount compared to competitors as they used to be invested in Oil sands, but they divested and are focused on Copper and Zinc now (and asphalt on the side).\n* ARCH ($46) - American Coking Coal producer; coking coal is different than thermal coal and used in steel plants\n   * ARCH started trading in late 2016 and was very profitable and at $90/share. Covid shut down steel plants nationwide causing massive losses in Q1-Q3 2020.\n   * Coal futures recently hit $80+/ton, and are expected to increase. ARCH already sold 20% of their 2021 production at $90/ton per their Q3 quarterly report, which is what coal traded at when ARCH was at $90/share. I read the report for you to know it's a rock solid company that's going to kill Q4 earnings.\n   * ARCH has a classic cup/handle setup over the past few months. TA that shit.\n\nThese stocks have a 100% upside at current commodity prices if stocks were to return to their 2010 valuations. However, unlike 2010, we have more tailwinds prompting commodity pricing questions. Commodity bull markets last for years, and our current global setup looks like we are at just the beginning of the largest commodity bull market in history. Global demand is increasingly massively, and production can't keep up. 2021 will be the beginning of the biggest commodity shock you'll see in your lifetime.\n\n**Plays**: Because you autists like to be told how to invest your money, I have good news for you - commodity stock options are CHEAP. IV is between 40-60%, and you can buy options below their actual value from boomers collecting dividends and playing thetagang on the side. Most major miners we expect will announce earnings in Feb 2021.\n\nI'm currently playing the following:\n\n* TECK - Feb 21 @ 20c\n* VALE - June 21 @ 25c\n* ARCH - May 21 @ 55c\n\nI've also sold about $70k in deep ITM puts in December/January to build equity as I want to own shares for the upcoming bull market.", "author_fullname": "t2_3qu1xukl", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded":

I&#39;ve purposely chosen this site for you retards over more technical sites because you can tell good (green) from bad (red). What you should immediately notice is that there&#39;s lots of green in the &quot;Monthly&quot; and &quot;YTD&quot; columns.

The commodity index has never been so undervalued! What does this mean??</p>\n\n<p><sup>\\</sup>*Third disclaimer**:)</p>\n\n<p><em>I&#39;m a firm believer that the world is entering the biggest commodity cycle we will ever know that will reset expectations on global commodity prices and last for at least a decade.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>What will drive this is a rapidly deteriorating global fiat currency (check your DXY charts</em> <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TVC-DXY/\"><em>here</em></a><em>), low interest rates creating an incentive to grow and build, emerging economies like Brazil and India becoming net importers of commodities, China&#39;s rapid growth, a modernizing infrastructure (electric railroad/planes, wind turbine tankers, hyperloops, space travel), investment in EVs (and subsequently batteries) and the infrastructure to support it, and stumbling economies in need of increased stimulus through infrastructure spending.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Supply and demand as we know it is about to swing massively, and you&#39;ll want to get in front of it. Commodities are what will bring us to new heights.</em></p>\n\n<p>Commodity stocks are grossly undervalued compared to the spot price of their underlying commodities. There&#39;s a few definitions/key things you need to know:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Spot Price: The current market price at which an asset is bought or sold for immediate payment and deliver.</li>\n<li>Futures Price: The prices at which an asset can be bought or sold for delivery in the future.</li>\n<li>Commodity companies often sell futures to lock in prices at a known rate.</li>\n<li>Miners often play multiple commodities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Here&#39;s a few examples you&#39;ve seen in recent WSB posts:</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>VALE ($17) - Brazilian miner who produces about 300 million tons of iron ore each year. They also produce Nickel.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Iron ore futures currently trade at ~ $150/ton. Last time iron ore futures were going into a bull market and hit $150/ton was in May 2010. VALE was trading in the $25-30 range.</li>\n<li>VALE just partially opened a previously closed mine to try to increase production to take advantage of prices.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>MT ($23) - Indian steel producer who produces about 92 million tons of steel each year.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Steel futures currently trade at ~ $640/ton. Steel has traded at this level for the past 5 years where MT traded in the $20-40 range.</li>\n<li>This is not accounting for spot steel, which you&#39;ve read about being much higher priced.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Here&#39;s a few examples you haven&#39;t seen in recent WSB posts:</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>TECK ($18) - Canadian Copper and Zinc miner with mines in Canada/Chile.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Copper futures currently trade at ~ $3.5/pound. Last time copper futures were going into a bull market and hit $3.5/pound, TECK hit $60 when copper ran up to $4.5/pound.</li>\n<li>Teck has great relationships with China and is opening one of the largest copper mines in the world next year.</li>\n<li>When copper hit $4/pound in 2010, TECK announced a $5/share special dividend.</li>\n<li>TECK is trading at a discount compared to competitors as they used to be invested in Oil sands, but they divested and are focused on Copper and Zinc now (and asphalt on the side).</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>ARCH ($46) - American Coking Coal producer; coking coal is different than thermal coal and used in steel plants\n\n<ul>\n<li>ARCH started trading in late 2016 and was very profitable and at $90/share. Covid shut down steel plants nationwide causing massive losses in Q1-Q3 2020.</li>\n<li>Coal futures recently hit $80+/ton, and are expected to increase. ARCH already sold 20% of their 2021 production at $90/ton per their Q3 quarterly report, which is what coal traded at when ARCH was at $90/share. I read the report for you to know it&#39;s a rock solid company that&#39;s going to kill Q4 earnings.</li>\n<li>ARCH has a classic cup/handle setup over the past few months. TA that shit.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These stocks have a 100% upside at current commodity prices if stocks were to return to their 2010 valuations. However, unlike 2010, we have more tailwinds prompting commodity pricing questions. Commodity bull markets last for years, and our current global setup looks like we are at just the beginning of the largest commodity bull market in history. Global demand is increasingly massively, and production can&#39;t keep up. 2021 will be the beginning of the biggest commodity shock you&#39;ll see in your lifetime.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Plays</strong>: Because you autists like to be told how to invest your money, I have good news for you - commodity stock options are CHEAP. IV is between 40-60%, and you can buy options below their actual value from boomers collecting dividends and playing thetagang on the side.
