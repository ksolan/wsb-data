{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Are you a fan of The Jetsons? No? You are not some old ass boomer and therefore, you don\u2019t even know what The Jetsons are?\n\nOk, fair enough. But chances are, you are probably retarded because you are wasting your time in this sub looking for tendies. And retarded people think the flying cars are coming (just like in The Jetsons).\n\nBut I hate to break it to you. The flying cars are not coming. Why? Because the popularity of this sub has turned most of the population quite retarded. No one is working in a garage somewhere working on a flying car. They are all watching Jim Cramer talking about autists and in turn, we are wasting time away in this sub for the next shitty stock that might make you tendies.\n\nHowever, self driving cars are quite real. And today, we are going to look at the market leader in the technology that will allow us to get there.\n\n**Self Driving Cars? How Real is This Shit?**\n\nOh, this shit is quite real. So real, in fact, you will hear about them often between now and the next 24 months. \n\n1. All the Boomer car companies want to be valued like tech stocks. So GM, Hyundai, Ford, VW, and you name them. They are all entering into some sort of partnership with tech companies that are making the tech that is required to make this a reality. (And it doesn\u2019t have to be full self driving. Any semi auto driving and driver assistance tech are high in demand) Call it a FOMO effect. The boomer car companies have been left behind by Tesla and other EV companies (in terms of investor excitement and stock valuation). So they don\u2019t want to be left behind in this trend. So they are all signing up and spooning each other with companies like NVDA, Intel\u2019s Mobileye, Google, Baidu, etc.\n\n2. The taxi industry as we know it, will be transformed once again. Why? Remember when Uber and Lyft disrupted the traditional taxi/cab industry by offering the same service using an App? I mean, who wants to walk outside and hail a cab (hoping to catch one) these days. No one, unless you are a boomer. Well, the same companies that disrupted the traditional taxi industry are motivated to disrupt it once again because of the on-going debate on whether Uber drivers should be classified as employees or contractors. Solution? Get rid of the drivers and make them all autonomous to make CEOs rich and drivers unemployed.\n\n3. Companies like Amazon and Walmart spend tons of money on deliveries and it requires them to hire a lot of drivers. In their relentless effort to cut cost, Amazon is looking into other methods of deliveries such as drones. Deliveries via self driving vehicles is simply another avenue that they will explore in their pursuit of increasing their profit so Bezos can get richer.\n\n4. The tech is here and available. And the key technology is something called LiDAR and the software platform that operates it.\n\n**What is LiDAR and why should I care?**\n\nThink of LiDAR as an eye of the self-driving vehicle providing it a 360 degree view. Just like a car that is driven and operated by a human being, a self driving car will need to figure out how to operate the vehicle thru traffic, potholes, trees and other obstacles on the road. Well, that\u2019s what the LiDAR technology provides. It serves as the eye for the self driving cars so it can move in and out of the traffic and get its passengers from Point A to Point B.\n\n**Ok, LiDAR is like an eye. But why should I care about Velodyne?**\n\nWell, Velodyne is the undisputed leader in this field and right now, they have the backers (Ford, Baidu, Nikon, Hyundai, etc).\n\nThey are the established market leader, with first mover advantage. Per Needham, Velodyne is expected to own 60% of the market share of autonomous vehicle market by 2024. They have 300+ customers with $800 Million in contracted revenue thru 2024. Additionally, there\u2019s an opportunity to incrementally add 60%+ increase in revenue over the same time period.\n\nWith their entrenched existing customers, there is a high switching cost. So unlike LAZR (which just lost Intel\u2019s Mobileye), their existing customer would not be able to easily switch their supplier or look for another supplier without incurring significant switching cost.\n\nBut the most important aspect of their competitive advantage in the LiDAR sensor market has to do with their pricing. When David Hall first participated in DARPA sponsored autonomous vehicle competition in 2005~, each LiDAR Sensor unit cost about $80,000. Today, Velodyne is able to sell similar LiDAR sensors between $100 - $600 per unit. No other competitor can offer a similarly competitive product at the same price range. \n\nVelodyne dominated this market for over 13 years. They have a broad product portfolio (not just LIDAR sensors) with global sales and mass scale manufacturing capabilities. They are not tied down to automotive market either as they currently expand to about 25+ new market segments.\n\nAdditionally, they can upsell to its existing customers with their Vella Collision Warning System. This is Velodyne\u2019s software solution to power their LiDAR products. They can offer automotive manufacturers with advanced capabilities including auto pilot, collision avoidance, pedestrian automotive emergency braking and more. Multiple automotive OEMs are in development on Velodyne\u2019s ADAS projects with initial deliveries happening right now. There are no BS research turned production deals like LAZR. They have real revenue, real products and real customers. \n\nToday, only 25% of their revenue is generated from LiDAR related technology. 75% of the revenue comes from ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), Robotics and Industrial Mapping, Shuttles, Smart City Delivery, etc.\n\n**Ok. So they got cool stuff and real customers. But what about their growth prospects?**\n\nWell, you greedy bastard. This company\u2019s growth aspects are primed to make you tendies over the next couple of years. In fact, this might be the kind of dream growth stock that you can bank on.\n\n1. Revenue Growth: Velodyne\u2019s projected revenue for 2020 is around $100 Million. They are expected to grow their revenue to $150 Million next year, $250 Million in 2022, $412 Million in 2023 and $684 Million in 2024. \n\n2. Earnings Growth: Velodyne is expected to incur losses of ($50 Million) this year. But they are expected to reduce this loss to ($8 Million) next year and be profitable from 2022 and forward. By 2024, they expect to be record EBITDA of $150 Million~.\n\n3. Gross Margin: Velodyne\u2019s gross margin on their LIDAR products is around 20% today. They expect to double this gross margin to 40% next year and continue to increase the margin from there.\n\n4. Product Mix Trend for Revenue: Today, significant portion of Velodyne\u2019s revenue comes from LIDAR and other automotive technology. But they plan to balance this out by increasing revenue from their software and license/subscription products going forward.\n\n5. Amazon\u2019s Zoox just launched a plan to start a robotaxi service in CA and NV by end of 2021 or early 2022 using Velodyne\u2019s LIDAR sensors. BAIDU is expected to enter its own EV vehicles and they are investors of Velodyne and can certainly use many of the technologies (not just LIDAR) offered by VLDR. Nikon is using VLDR\u2019s LIDAR tech for its lineup of products (similar to iPhone 12 Pro using LiDAR) going forward. As a market leader in the LIDAR tech and also leader in pricing advantage with backers such as Hyundai, BAIDU, Ford, etc, this is just the beginning.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nConclusion:\n\n1. They have far superior LIDAR product and they can sell it at much affordable price point. They have over 300+ customers and the customers cannot simply switch to another supplier due to high cost of switching.\n\n2. Current market cap is around $ 4 Billion (give or take). In comparison, LAZR\u2019s market valuation is around $14 Billion. Never mind that LAZR has no real revenue (i.e. their recent filing indicates that all of their revenue is from interest income), lost Mobileye as customer only about a month after inking a deal, and they don\u2019t have bullshit \u201cresearch turned into production\u201d deals either. So the bottom line is that this stock is super cheap.\n\n3. They will be profitable by 2022 and increase their revenue by almost seven folds by 2024. They are the undisputed leader with the right technology and the right backers/partners. Good news is only starting and for a change, it\u2019s still not too late for you to get in.\n\nTarget Price: $30 by March 2021.
