Aurinia pharmaceuticals is a small Canadian company with a flagship drug, voclosporin awaiting US FDA review and approval after its phase 3 trial. Voclosporin is a drug designed to treat lupus nephritis which, if untreated or poorly treated, leads to kidney failure requiring lifelong dialysis and/or death. I do happen to be an internal medicine provider and can tell you the current treatment for lupus nephritis is very limited, though I am admittedly no expert on this. The potential market is a few billion dollars annually just in US market. The good news is voclosporin is in under \u201curgent review\u201d meaning it\u2019s review schedule got pushed up due to positive phase 3 results and the target date is January 22, 2021. I did review their most recent summit presentation and the reported results are very encouraging. You may start looking around and see that volclosporin got shot down for dry eye recently, fear not. They are just searching for off label uses. They also have been testing its efficacy against covid. \n\nNow, that is all fine and dandy. And I\u2019ve been seeing pharm companies rocket on news like this, G L S I anyone? This kind of news triggers immediate and enormous buying, that much is irrefutable. But the pharm game is for sure a casino. In fact I just got burned putting my hand a little too close to O D T. A few pieces of news are gravitating me closer to this company though. First, AUPH leased a 17k square feet manufacturing site 20 miles from the CDC about three months ago. That would suggest they are preparing for rapid uptake in production very soon. Second, they recently bolstered an agreement with Lonza in Switzerland to also prep for huge production in the next few years. Lastly, they hired Peter Greenleaf as CEO of the company. Greenleaf is an artist at pharmaceutical company buy outs (which I see happening in 2021 possibly assuming flagship approval). All of this has me caught up in the possibilities of Christmas in January. \n\nTLDR:  AUPH 2/19 $17c x10, 200 shares at $14.08. Fireworks at end of January 2021.
