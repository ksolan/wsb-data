Stonk prices were formerly STRONGLY tempered by an ability to pay out cash dividends and very simple ROI formulas that everyone could understand- a 'come to reality' accounting of their actual revenue and profit performance that couldn't be bullshitted for very long. Most equity valuations haven't been tethered to a foundational \"proof is in the pudding\" dividend reality for a long time and now transact on the much more fragile- and gameable- thesis that you own a fractional share in something that (theoretically) represents something you can (theoretically) one day sell for more to someone else because in theory, a number on a ledger went up and (theoretically) grew... and in theory, that all represents something worth buying.  We've now seen that a company can traverse an entire business lifecycle over many decades without paying a single cent in dividends and along the way, all kinds of people remain enthusiastic about its equity 'value', up the hill and back down again. \n\nThis is not a 'new normal' or \"this time, it's different'. It has been the norm for a while, just that nobody is talking about it and what it means, shorter term, is that 'value' is whatever we say it is.  \n\n*Accepting this persistent and long term land of make-believe that began when theoretical book valuations took the high ground over actual dividends, value fundamentals are still not dead and never will be (because at the end of the day, there's downside-risk safety in value and making tactical +ev plays is how value guys win), but value has become more of a widely influential folklore, like a religion, rather than a fundamental law of economic physics against which sale prices of shares must eventually abide by. Value is accepted or ignored at the whim of broader market liquidity, which is driven by factors that nobody here controls and probably goes back to a counsel of hooded clerics in secret rooms, somewhere in a musty Luxembourg castle. If you're playing the long-long game, OK, fine. Value... but if you're playing the short-long game, those rules don't matter. \n\n*If you're a value fundamentalist (which is fine, there are definitely tendies there if you're patient enough to compound tiny wins over a very long term) you can freely reject PLTR along with all other growth equities, because of what your good book says. There are no issues with you. Move along, go get that dividend, we love and support you for the son that you are to us and accept you and your husband with open arms. \n\n*Here's where the current, broadly-accepted narrative gets incoherent. Value is either an inarguable gravity that eventually forces everything to 'get real', or it isn't... and while value and fundamentals might be the statistically optimal on-average play on a long timeline in terms of risk, on a shorter and mid-term timeline, value is basically irrelevant compared to estimating- and getting ahead of- sentiment and estimating business trajectory. The QUALATATIVE. What we're seeing more and more of is talking heads embracing or rejecting value fundamentals situationally, if value supports a position they want to rationalize, however it doesn't work like that. \n\n*Example: Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley pissed on PLTR and called for underweight with a target @ 17, noting thusly:\n\n>\"With PLTR up 155% since listing with very little change in the fundamental story, the risk/reward paradigm shifts decidedly negative for the shares.
