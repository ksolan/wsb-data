We've all been fudded to death with blockbuster analogies and the rise of online gaming and steam. So why would anyone ever step foot in a Gamestop? \n\nWhile true that people are shifting away from standard brick and motor they are also seeking human interaction and experiential retail experiences. Part of the Sherm overhaul is specifically focusing on making these stores hubs to get expert knowledge from, and talk shit about peoples favorite games. \n\nYou know who loves to hang out in stores and endlessly talk about fantasy worlds with clerks and then spend money? Gamers, the lonely and Otakus all of which were packing out a local EB games (NZ Gamestop) and it was packed not only with people buying games but verbally shitposting at the clerks about the finer points of the Halo nerf gun and its accuracy compared to the game, which frankly as bullish as all the people walking out of there with EB game bags. \n\nOver this side of the world our internet can be a little shithouse some times as well. To the point that if you are trying to download a game that is unironically 90GBs it can take 2 days and blow your entire internet cap. This demographic is a lot larger then you think as most people don't have the patience or time to wait for the latest game hot the market. So no people are not going to be only downloading through online stores quite just yet. Also gamers love to show their collection. Its a mark of pride to show the your evolution and lineage from the first disk of Crash Bandicoot to your modern day COD collection. \n\nAnother addition I haven't seen mentioned in any recent DD is that the new PS5 only has 667GBs of storage. That is absolutely not hard to pack out with a few modern games and the ability to have more storage is disabled, to be [enabled on a future update](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551165/sony-ps5-playstation-5-no-m2-ssd-expansion-launch).\n\n## okay but what about the massive amount of losses?\n\nPart of these losses was writing off GOODWILL which is comprised of intangible assets which essentially means THEY DIDN'T LOSE ANYWHERE NEAR AS MUCH ACTUAL DOLLARS. They were writing off the fact they pissed their customers off and drove the brand name into the mud. So it is entirely likely they can return to profitability and soon after and its worth remembering that even a hateful emotional attachment is top of mind when stuck at 57.4 GB. Don't be fooled by the sly bear saying the company is going bankrupt they have more then enough cash to see them through until Sherms strategy plays itself out or they eventually kick him out for failing at his job. \n\n## But what about the revenue miss and the stores closing how can that possibly be bullish? or how I learned to stop worrying and love Sherman.\n\nPrior to shutting the stores GME was everywhere and had infested malls to the point of absurd inefficiency. There was a point where within the small mall there were multiple gamestops that were essentially competing with each other. As it is physical stores are ridiculously expensive to run. A good action to take in when you have too many stores and there is a shift online would be to close down unneeded stores and focus more on online shopping. And guess what? Thats exactly what the Sherm omniclose strat is all about. That's why when people say that closing 1000 stores is bullish, that while yes it will drop revenue, it will also allow Gamestop to focus more intently on profitable stores and Ecommerce. \n\nThen there is the shift towards a greater product line like console accessories, gaming headsets and focused advertising. This is part of building an experiential service that will be a league against companies like amazon that can't customize for hardcore gamers who lets face it are fanatics when it comes to their genre of choice.

But there are actually more big dogs then Cohen and Burry betting that GME is going to turn around. What I've seen missing is Daniel Foss the billionaire and Senvest who \"employs a contrarian, value-based investment strategy \" or specialize in underdogs due for a comeback. Why would they do that? because they also see the big opportunity of a Gamestop turn around with sensible fiscal management and a turn towards being a multi product eCommerce store.
