{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "\\*\\*KPTI... im fucking retarded\n\n**DISCLAIMER: This is my personal opinion and not professional investment advice.**\n\nOkay retards I've been watching this stock for a few months and I got a banger for us to make some tendies on. So hear me out, it's a clinically proven fact that vaccines are the leading cause of retardation. Just think about it, have you ever gotten a vaccine before (the answer is probably yes)? Now ask yourself, where are you currently? Are you at home, at work, on the porcelain throne? NOPE, you are in the retard capital of the world, r/wallstreetbets. After being a longtime lurker in this subreddit there is one thing that's clear to me, the **RETARDS** make money, and the **CHADS** blow up their accounts. So that is where the basis for this option play comes from.\n\nVaccine HYPE = Retarded GAINS.\n\n## Karyopharm Therapeutics - Who Are They?\n\nKaryopharm Therapeutics is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company pioneering novel cancer therapies. Their leading therapeutic drug, Xpovio (Selinexor), is a selective inhibitor of nuclear exports. It works by binding to the exportin 1 (XPO1), also known as the chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1), which is a eukaryotic protein that mediates the nuclear export of various proteins and RNAs. So in layman's terms this drug works by blocking the transport of cancerous proteins involved in cancer-cell growth. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication and is approved for the use in patients with a type of cancer called multiple myeloma [\\[1\\]](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/22/2051422/0/en/Karyopharm-Announces-FDA-Approval-of-XPOVIO-selinexor-for-the-Treatment-of-Patients-with-Relapsed-or-Refractory-Diffuse-Large-B-cell-Lymphoma-DLBCL.html).\n\n# Karyopharm Therapeutics - Why Should I Care?\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) is caused by the single stranded RNA virus (SARS-CoV2). A protein called exportin 1 (XPO1) has been shown to be important in both the virus lifecycle and the inflammation caused by the virus. The inhibition of XPO1 by taking Selinexor leads to both anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties. So while this drug may not be a \u201cvaccine\u201d per-se, it has the efficacy of being used for patients with COVID-19 to help relieve symptoms and drastically reduce the chance of the being put on a ventilator due to its anti-inflammatory effects on the lungs alveoli (tiny air sacs that fill with oxygen when you inhale). This is what makes this company so valuable, the fact that they aren't dependent on a hit or miss vaccine, they have a reliable treatment to COVID-19, which is a leading cure for cancer. Karyopharm gets all the hype around vaccines, while maintaining very little of the expectations of putting out a working product (they already have one).\n\n# Pre-Vaccine Outlook\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8nq8kzv9hs561.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ec33611dadf41926ab4192323e52026e98f876c\n\nThis was my pre-vaccine outlook on this stock. I was hoping it was getting ready to skyrocket, unfortunately it kept its steady decline downwards, hitting resistance in the $14-$15 range. Thank god I was a CHAD at the time and didn't end up investing. However, one thing happened on November 9th that set the events for this stock to skyrocket - VACCINE SZN! So now I'm back and more retarded than ever and willing to bet big on this one.\n\n# Post-Vaccine Outlook\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mh1d2r4bhs561.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b6abd2d961e6bc3a67ff11f7293927e8d6ac80c\n\nI have put together some of the most discussed stocks \u201cVaccine Stocks\u201d in the last month that I felt were somewhat connected to Karyopharm in that their vaccines/treatments focus on an RNA inhibitor either preventing the spread of the virus or drastically reduce the chance of you getting it all together (basically tricking the body into thinking you already had it). Group 1 Stocks have already popped from their November 9th price point, however, Group 2 Stocks have been lagging behind. **Pfizer (PFE)** being the first big name company to announce and commercialize a vaccine already had this priced into their stock price. Analysts predicted that this vaccine would increase Pfizer's earnings by 10% next year with an expected sale of 1.3 billion doses of their Covid vaccine. **Karyopharm (KPTI)** is in a unique position as it has been vastly overshadowed by the big name companies debuting a vaccine and awaiting FDA approval, while Karyopharm already has an effective treatment that is multifaceted in its use. Once Covid 19 is gone, the treatment can still be heavily commercialized for cancer treatments.\n\n**Applicable Quote:**\n\n>\u201cShows you what the little snake slithering through the grass can do when it stays undetected\u201d  \n>  \n>\\- Professional Investor\n\nKPTI is the undetected slithering snake in the market currently.\n\n# Technical Analysis\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vtoeoj8dhs561.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=95b69644161175974f4808d84d868f2af6622fda\n\n We all know technicals are bullshit, so ill keep this short. Looking at the technicals I think we are set up to ramp up over the next month back to the \\~$17.5 - $20 range. I have purchased both $17.5 1/15 Calls and $20 2/19 Calls. About $10,000 worth combined. \n\n**TLDR:**\n\nJust buy this shit. Xpovio (Selinexor) link in helping treat COVID-19 and potential vaccine trials brought this company a lot of exposure in Wall Street as well as mainstream media which should bring it short/mid term gains from those trying to profit off this vaccine hype that's driving the market currently.\n\nBuy 1-2 month out OTM calls.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n**Investor Outlook on Covid-19:**\n\n[https://investors.karyopharm.com/2020-10-06-Karyopharm-Announces-Selinexor-Clinical-Data-to-be-Presented-at-the-International-Society-for-Influenza-and-Other-Respiratory-Virus-Diseases-Antiviral-Group-Virtual-Conference-on-Therapeutics-for-COVID-19](https://investors.karyopharm.com/2020-10-06-Karyopharm-Announces-Selinexor-Clinical-Data-to-be-Presented-at-the-International-Society-for-Influenza-and-Other-Respiratory-Virus-Diseases-Antiviral-Group-Virtual-Conference-on-Therapeutics-for-COVID-19)\n\n**National Library of Medicine Article on Covid-19 and Exportin 1 Inhibition:**\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7305737/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7305737/)", "author_fullname": "t2_70kr8", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "KTPI -
