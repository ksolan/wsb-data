And as you\u2019ve probably seen, silver has moved up \\~8% in a few days (miners \u2013 15% and more). So here we go.\n\nThis post is designed to give a start to those of you, who know nothing about this field and just want to dip their toes. In no way, shape or form I poses professional knowledge or formal education on mining, this is purely what I\u2019ve learned speculating stocks.\n\nHere you can find my basic write-ups on:\n\n[\\- precious metals ETFs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i4qq4u/the_autistic_guide_to_precious_metals_etfs/)\n\n[\\- gold miners](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqzije/gold_mines_w_positions_and_plays/)\n\n[\\- jewelry public companies](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ikqo3m/jewelry_a_bear_playing_a_bull_disguised_as_a_bear/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. Why invest in silver miners?**\n\nI\u2019ll give you 5 reasons:\n\n1. Silver is a stronger (but riskier) hedge against monetary inflation: if you are right about inflation gold will move, but silver will move more;\n2. Silver has much more industrial usage than gold;\n3. Jewelers have bigger demand for silver than gold;\n4. Silver to gold price ratio is historically low right now and all commodities are undepriced compared to equity futures like S&P.\n5. Silver is future-proof, unlike gold: it is heavily used in solar panels and electronics. Also, 2019 industrial and jewelry demand of silver is very suppressed: only jewelry silver demand is estimated to lose 23% in 2020.\n\nIn fact, let\u2019s talk about demand:\n\nAs of 2018, total demand was 32 146 tons of physical silver:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ce1b3cfs2t561.png?width=715&format=png&auto=webp&s=623d38466713f2d66beaa7ed251225dc00556930\n\nIndustrial use: 17997 tons (\\~ 56%);\n\nJewelry: 6611 tons (\\~ 21%);\n\nCoins and bars: 5637 tons (\\~ 18%);\n\nSilverware: 1900 tons (\\~ 6%).\n\nAmong industrial demand electronics contributes 7730 tons, while solar was already 2503 tons in 2018. This will only increase. Yep, you\u2019ve probably thought that majority of silver is used on silver spoons that your grandma used to pick up in Target, while cool futuristic kids use lithium in Tesla\u2019s. Turns out, solar panels already use more silver than all of the silverware combined.\n\nThere\u2019s also another reason to play silver miners right now: it was harder hit by Covid lockdowns. Why so? Because majority of silver production is done in Latin America (in fact, out of 6 biggest producing countries \u2013 4 are in Latin America) and Latin countries on average had much tougher lockdowns, compared to leading gold producers like Australia, China, Russia, etc.\n\n**2. How silver is mined?**\n\nUnlike some other metals, silver is never found on itself. It is always mined in ores that contain either of three large groups of metals: gold, copper, zinc and lead. Ore is then processed and refined to get the end product. Why is this important? Because when you build a model trying to forecast earnings of the company you can not focus on silver prices alone, you have to take every byproduct into consideration.\n\n**3. How to determine which mine is a good buy?**\n\n**3.1. Let\u2019s start by understanding metrics.** Your regular EBITDA, EPS or even FCF won\u2019t tell you much about where the miner is going, because\n\na) they do not determine the price of their product;b) they have no direct control over the longevity of the product source.\n\nThat\u2019s why gold miners came out with their unique metrics by which they evaluate each individual mine and then calculate producer\u2019s average. Those metrics are Cash Cost and All-in Sustaining Costs. Those are non-GAAP metrics and I\u2019m not even sure if they are audited.\n\nCash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining, processing, administration, production taxes and royalties which are not based on sales or taxable income calculations, but are exclusive of amortization, reclamation, capital, development and exploration costs. AISC is, basically, a wider metric introduced later by World Gold Council. It includes every cost of running a mine excluding:\u2022 Income tax.\u2022 Working capital (except for adjustments to inventory on a sales basis).\u2022 All financing charges (including capitalized interest).\u2022 Costs related to business combinations, asset acquisitions and asset disposals.\u2022 Items needed to normalize earnings, for example impairments on non-current assets and one-time material severance charges.\n\nIf you want to learn more about quirks and features of those metrics I urge you to read this paper: [https://digitalcommons.mtech.edu/mine\\_engr/9/](https://digitalcommons.mtech.edu/mine_engr/9/)\n\nSo take metal futures prices average during quarter, subtract AISC and here goes your mine profit before taxes and royalty payments.\n\n**3.2. Silver miners now also use mostly AISC**. And calculating silver production they use Ag Eq metrics, which is average ratio of silver to all other byproducts over the quarter. And when they present profits, they also use Ag Eq sold, which again include silver and all byproducts.\n\nI would argue, that Ag Eq metrics are also misleading for silver miners. Because when a gold miners produce gold all other byproducts are not that numerous and, what\u2019s more important, far, far cheaper, thus their impact is negligible. Silver is a different story. For example, let's take Caylloma mine, 2019. They produced 45.6kk lb of Zinc, 28.7kk lb of Lead and 0.9 kk oz of silver. In today prices this would be 58kk USD / 27kk USD and 23.4kk USD. As you can see, in fact silver's output for this mine is the smallest. I've even came across arguments, that silver should never be considered a main product, only a byproduct.\n\nThe problem for you is that you might be watching only silver prices, which, say increase 25% and wonder, why your miner isn\u2019t doing so great, while ignoring that zinc and lead prices dropped and it had a bigger impact on your miner, than rising silver.\n\nWhat you could use instead is a total cost of tonnes milled. Most miners publish this metric. And then model every metal received separately. In fact, most analysts try to model grades of mines, which is basically amount of useful stuff among all shit excavated. But we\u2019re getting really too deep now.\n\n**3.3. Another extremely important thing to remember is a life of a mine.** See, it can be very different: some mines can live 20 years, some are ending their life cycle. You open prospects of a miner and you search for the guidance on the next year and you see how much metals they plan to produce. Then you check expected life of their assets. If an asset is nearing it\u2019s end, grades usually get lower, which means less profits. Also, investors put a pressure on a miner to replace dying asset, and if nothing is found in time \u2013 stock price tends to trade lower than what it\u2019s cash flows might suggest.\n\nThere are also surprise scenarios like extending the life expectancy of a mine, or finding new deposits. But that\u2019s a gamble.\n\nOnce a mine is done, it becomes a liability, instead of an asset, because it is put on care and maintenance, which is expensive and lasts years and years. That\u2019s why I prefer junior miners with only few assets: they usually do not baghold liabilities from long-gone projects. And also it\u2019s easier to model them.\n\n**3.4. Finally, pay attention to jurisdictions**: how stable the local governments are, how corrupt or how focused on ESG standards. Unfortunately, mining is a risky business with bad rep (sometime deserved, sometimes not). That\u2019s why a populist government can always blame miners on some environmental or social damage and close them down or nationalize the mine.\n\n**Bonus.** Let\u2019s look into my biggest silver position as of today: Fortuna Silver Mine (**FSM**).\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. Relatively stable jurisdictions of Mexico, Peru and Argentina;\n2. Heavy Covid lockdowns, so I could pick it up rather cheap;\n3. Peru and Mexico mines have at least 5 years of life;\n4. They have gold mine under construction in Argentina. It is expected to have 15 years of life and to produce 150k oz of gold per year at AISC 800 USD/oz. This is not yet properly priced in, because FSM is trading following mainly silver and silver miners ETFs. This is also in part because the project has been delayed several times. But they\u2019ve already mined first 15k oz this year, so I have little doubt that they will achieve meaningful production next year.\n5. Relatively low cost of production;\n6. CEO is third generation miner and Peru national;\n7. They have increased their debt to finance Argentina project, but the net debt is not that big compared to Free Cash Flow;\n8. Sprott fund is heavily into this stock and so is Adrian Day (he has his own fund and also manages Peter Schiff\u2019s funds while Peter sticks to ranting about the Fed on his radio).\n\nI have a price target of 8.66 for FSM, with a rather conservative metal prices estimate.\n\n**Let\u2019s sum it all up.**\n\n**Why invest in a silver miner?**\n\nBecause silver moves more than gold, because it has much more industrial and practical use and it has future upside.\n\n**How do you find good silver miners?**\n\nYou pick stable jurisdictions, you look into byproducts and estimate if those also fit your outlook and price expectancy and, finally, you check the life expectancy of the mines. Of course, do not forget to look into the books and check the debt ratios.\n\nTo be fair, I\u2019ll also list considerations **why NOT to invest in a silver miner**:\n\n1. company has almost no control over the price of the product;\n2. high political and social risks;\n3. uncertainty of the company\u2019s future once it\u2019s mines reach their end: there\u2019 no guarantee that the management will be able to find an asset of an equal quality, thus rarely miners are \u2018buy and hold forever\u2019;\n4. no goodwill, brand value or any kind of a moat;\n5. mining industry has a bad rep and is often operating in remote areas, thus it\u2019s very limited in it\u2019s access to good labour;\n6. basically, no meaningful dividend.\n\nHope this helps someone to make an educated decision or to carry a deeper research. If any of you have questions or would like to discuss commodities \u2013 I\u2019ll be glad. Also, I might do a write up on commodities that will be used in future green tech (EVs, solar, etc), since there\u2019s so much more than just lithium.
