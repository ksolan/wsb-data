That's right, the weekend squad arrived early. So get your passports and grab your nuts because this bitch is gonna be flying. \n\nAre you in MT? What convinced you? Was it the supply shortage? The increasing demand? The raising of tonnage prices? The fucking awesome quarterly improvements? Don't lie, I know you saw some meme and that was all it took. So peep this. Where the fuck is MT located? Fucking Luxemburg! Have you even been to Luxemburg? No! Neither have I. Who the fuck goes to Luxemburg? But I know Luxemburg is a small-ass land locked country about half the size of a Texas county. How the fuck do they have this steel industry!? They don't! See, if you cock-yodeling ballsack-ticklers did your own DD, you'd know MT has facilities on every continent. You know what that means? They can serve every fucking market. If the Rona gets one, fuck it, they're still going in the others. It also means production never stops! I don't care if you're a Flyover-Country Redneck or an Ethiopian Cheetah Chaser, there is an MT facility near you. \n\nBut I'm not here to pump MT (I mean, it wouldn't hurt me if I were...buy moar MT). No, I'm here for you dick whistlers, and to make you think big picture shit. I wish the retarded ass mods would let me tell you about the specific companies I'm trying to tell you about, but since they're below $1bn market cap, I'll get scolded by the bots.  So, do your own fucking DD and figure it out, but something about GOLDEN OCEANS that are made of SALTwater might be a good place to start. \n\nSo here's the deal, I want you to think macro for a second. Did you know there is a world beyond your own dicks? Incredible, I know, who the fuck wants to spend time there? But it's true! There's all sorts of shit out there; cows, ships, mountains. Shit's crazy man. So think for a moment. How does a company like MT get it's shit? If you're making steel, you're going to need lots of coal and iron, right? I bet they don't get that shit from fucking Luxemburg. So there's your first macro thought to ponder regarding companies I can't tell you about. Who mines the iron and coal for the steel industry? Who does that black lung shit for MT? Here's your second thought to ponder: How the fuck does it get to the fucking steel plant? Barges and big ass ships! Whose got those? Well, do your own DD, this is a learning experience, ok? Also, can we please adjust the banned ticker market cap? Then ask yourself, \"who the fuck services/supplies the mines and ships that are going to be sending me tendies through MT?\"  \n\nLook, if you jumped into MT because you recognize the metals market is bullish af right now, why not consider investing in the whole chain? Do your own DD, that's good advice in general, but figure out who else is printing tendies off this boom. This isn't tech, don't expect anything meaningful before Summer, but if you ever felt like being Cornelius Vanderbilt, buy the whole damn chain.  Do yo chain hang low?
