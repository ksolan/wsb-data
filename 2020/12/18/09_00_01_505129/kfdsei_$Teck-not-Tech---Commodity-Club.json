{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Welcome Commodity Club investors. Here's an introduction to the next 10x to add to your portfolio. Let's get started. \n\n**^(Disclaimer)**^(: I work in healthcare and not in mining. I've also been a TECK investor since 2016.) \n\n**Background**: \n\n$TECK - Teck Resources is a large Canadian miner that focuses in Copper, Zinc, Coking Coal, and Bitumen (Asphalt) mining. It's Canada's 20th largest company (as of 2019) and it's largest miner (Barrick Gold @ #2). It has an interesting history - in 2008, they nearly went bankrupt and were bailed out by Chinese investors (they bought 17% of the company), and was further reiterated by electing a Chinese Official to it's board of directors in 2016. \n\nThe easiest way to explain TECK is that it's a large Canadian miner that has close ties with China. \n\n**Fundamentals**: \n\nI've listed to TECK's earnings calls and read their quarterly reports so you don't have to. However, it's best to start with TECK's history. Here's a summary of their scale: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2015-2019 Production by Commodity ](https://preview.redd.it/0782nlnseu561.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae38ebf5c8083015800ff12d49ffc8a759927245)\n\nAll you ESG (Environmental, social and corporate governance) know that no one likes to touch coal (which is massively undervalued btw - coking coal, not thermal coal - there's a difference), but let's ignore that bit for a minute. TECK was the top mining company in the DJOW Sustainability index for 2019, and on the list for 10 straight years. \n\nFirst thing to call out - TECK's output is stable - it hasn't really changed an any area except Bitumen (Asphalt) in the past 5 years. \n\nHere's TECK's 2020 H2 numbers (let's forget Q1/2): \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[H2 Guidance from October 26](https://preview.redd.it/5hvrnguaju561.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad4a6cb53a346bbfcf656d005d185b725188730f)\n\nTECK's production is largely stable across quarters, so what does this insight show us: \n\n* Steelmaking coal will be lower YoY\n   * This was expected as they shutdown a coal mine for 5 months. They also are expecting Union protests at a coal terminal (not something they own). \n* Copper is inline with expectations \n* Zinc is above expectations\n* Bitumen is too new to establish a trend/expectations, but overall seems low\n\nLet's now compare TECK's commodity expectations against current future prices: \n\n* Steelmaking coal: \n   * Expected Cost of Sales: $67/ton - due to reduced mining output and sales and declining to $60/ton by December. Additionally, transportation is about $40/ton for your railcar. \n      * Expect transportation costs to be on the higher end or higher. Everyone is shipping right now, and rail/freight is super expensive. \n   * Met coal is very hard to find real-time prices on, but typically is about $150/ton (fell to $100/ton in Q1-2). If you have a Bloomberg Terminal, please share real-time prices with us plebeians. \n      * Currently I expect met coal to be trading about $140/ton. Coal prices are [rapidly rising](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/coal) after all time lows from Covid. \n   * [News](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/23/2131382/0/en/Teck-Provides-Steelmaking-Coal-Market-Update.html) on China/Teck coal relations - Teck maintains Q4 coal volume of 5.8-6.2m/tons, but will ship 20% to China due to increased demand \n      * Read the article - China is willing to pay Teck $30-35/ton over Australian spot. Recent shipments in November were $160-165/ton, which is a huge premium, and likely only increased in recent weeks. They've also sold 7.5m tons (25% annual production) at $50 over Australian spot for 2021. China is eating steel, and Teck is feeding the fire. \n   * Coal production expectations were higher for Q4 due to better ore grade, but TECK didn't provide numbers for increased expectations. We might see higher than 6.2m tons on rising prices. \n   * Coal was clubbed like a baby seal in Q1-2 because most steel plants world-wide were shutdown. If you read this thread, you know that Steel is reaching record high prices due to limited supply from these plant shutdowns. It would be prudent of you to invest in met coal, which is used in blast furnaces in steel production. Prices are rapidly rising and coal companies are wildly undervalued. \n      * Check out Arch Resources for a large US coal company play. \n   * TECK noted in Q3 report that coal orders were below COVID levels, but with current prices and confirmation on trading prices, we should see increased revs on coal for Q4. \n      * TECK noted that companies were not selling coal as it would be at a huge loss, so there was significant quantity in queue at port. However, they also noted that Australia didn't have any in port, so it should be non-Australiana coal miner taking advantage of recent coal price increases. \n      * They also note that there's significant inventory of coking coal in China, so we shouldn't expect this to be a big driver for earnings.\n      * FWIW - China is mostly buying coal from Mongolia at prices $100 over spot. Go look on twitter for proof. \n      * TECK also acknowledges that they can meet increased demand from China if needed for Coal. However, they've closed mines over the past year, which decreases their ability to scale. \n* Copper: \n   * Expected cost of sales - $1.55/pound on the high end. Trading at $3.5+/pound is a huge margin. Look for increases in copper to make this soar. \n   * Copper prices were $3.02/pound on Oct 26 and are at $3.61/pound today. That's a 19% increase in pricing for you mathematicians. \n   * QB2 is going to be a huge copper mine that comes operational in 2022. Copper prices continuing to increase is super bullish for TECK to take advantage of higher copper prices. \n      * Most of TECK's losses are going into capital expenditures for a huge copper mine opening in 2022. Copper demand will increase 100% by 2030 per BHP (world's largest copper producer), so this is super bullish. Buy into mines opening soon. \n      * TECK trades almost 50% of copper to China. This isn't an anomaly. \n* Zinc: \n   * Zinc is bearish for TECK - their mine has decreasing volume YoY each quarter. It's a dying mine, but still super profitable. \n   * Zinc is about $.60/pound for cost for sales. \n   * Zinc shipments to China rose by 40%. China zinc production decreased, which led them to reach out to TECK. \n   * Zinc is trading at 21% increase compared to prices at earnings. \n   * Zinc is more complicated as there is different prices depending on the grade. \n   * Mining volume should increase in Q4 to match 2019 output. Mining output in Q4 2019 was about double. \n\n**Outlook**: \n\nCommodities are entering a multi-year bull market, and TECK is a great investment. As a trader though, you are looking for a short-term profit rather than a long term hold. Here's a few things to help: \n\n* Copper should consolidate before moving towards $4/pound. That pullback is your opportunity to buy the dip. \n* Canadian Banks primarily cover $TECK and have Price Estimates between $23-27. My personal price target with copper holding $3.6/pound is $30 by March. TECK is low market cap ($10b right now). It booms and busts with commodity changes. $TECK at usual 2010-2020 prices would be about $12b rev/annually, but that'll change with current prices. \n* TECK acknowledges there is consolidation in the sector. How cool is that? \n* Q3 call focused on coal and water treatment. It didn't focus on Copper and Zinc, which are skyrocketing. Analysts were wanting to assess TECK's weaknesses, and confirmed that there's a huge buying opportunity here. \n* Bitumen (asphalt) was a loss on $TECK's books in Q3. Bitumen is up 12% on the month, but it is a new commodity and hard to evaluate. \n* Disclaimer: Miners estimate their ore output. When they announce earnings, it will change. \n* TECK will have about $500m in capital expenditures in Q4. That's bullish for long term, but maybe hurtful in short term. \n* Covid has minimal impact and is easy tax write-off. \n* TECK has plenty of debt revolvers to finance mines. \n* Copper will go to $4 with expectations of EVs and Clean energy <3\n\n**Napkin Math**: \n\n* $TECK revs are expected at $2.8b CAD. We should well exceed that. \n   * 6m tons of coal @ $150 = $900m - this is a super bullish number. If at $130, then we get $780m. \n      * Cost is $100/ton. That's $30-50/ton of profit. or $180-300m in profit. \n   * Let's expect a $2/pound profit on copper. That's a $600m profit on copper. \n   * Let's expect $1.20/pound profit on Zinc. That's $565m profit on zinc, with considerable upside if volume increases\n\n**Plays**: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My plays](https://preview.redd.it/yiwfu1fpev561.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=70f32eb5928301f9fad0910e4763795d20adfec3)\n\nI believe this will go to $30 by March.
