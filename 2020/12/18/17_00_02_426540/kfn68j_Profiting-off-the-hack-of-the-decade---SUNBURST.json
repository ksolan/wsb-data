To save you some reading, the most relevant parts are:  1) Detect the attack 2) Contain the damage 3) Eradicate the attacker 4) Recover from the attack and Prepare to prevent the next one.    Each phase of this process is going to favor particular players.  Here is who:\n\n**Detect and Contain**\n\n$FEYE - These guys detected what the CIA, NSA, DHS and everyone else missed.  FireEye/Mandiant are THE company you bring in when you have a major breach and were the ones to discover that the Russians backdoor'ed SolarWinds software.  Simply put, they are the best in the world at Detect and Contain.  Their phone is now ringing off the hook with panicked companies and government agencies willing to pay nearly anything for them to find the well hidden hackers on their network.\n\n**Eradicate and Recover**\n\nThese attackers are in so deep and are so stealthy, that fully eradicating the them is going to mean completely rebuilding massive computer networks.  When NotPetya was unleashed on the world, recovery cost FedEx $400 million and Maersk $300 million.  We could see similar levels of spend at some impacted entities.\n\n$LDOS, $GD, $NOC, $BAH - [These guys are top government contractors](https://www.cyberscoop.com/six-big-vendors-dominate-a-fragmented-federal-cybersecurity-market-numbers-show/) that have skills in cyber defense, the feds are comfortable with them and have contract vehicles to quickly start throwing money their way.  As someone who responds to cybershit for a living, its hard to overstate the amount of work it will take to rebuild computer networks hit by this attack.  The government will need an army of contractors to surge remediation personnel and it will take months.\n\n**Revenge**\n\n[Biden is already promising retaliation](https://www.axios.com/biden-fireeye-solarwinds-hack-retaliation-1d9eac1e-a454-43cf-9241-10c05b2d7586.html) and for anyone that paid attention during the Snowden revelations, we know that $BAH is balls deep in with the NSA on the offensive side the house.  Surging offensive capacity is going to be a good thing for the folks at Booze.\n\n**Never Again**\n\nDetecting and defending against cyber attacks like this is f'ing hard.  Defenders need advanced training and technology. Autist favorite $PLTR is going to be a favorite here.   Not only does the government love them, their platform has a proven track record of uncovering hard to detect attacks like [ghosnet](https://www.palantir.com/wp-assets/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ImpactStudy_GhostNet.pdf) and Shadow Network.  Business is about to get really good at Palantir as government agencies like DOE, Treasury, DHS and others double-down on their software and services to put AI and ML detection technologies in place.
