Since [demo day on January 26,](https://palantir.events/livedemoday) we\u2019ve seen a very interesting strategy for Phase 2 and we will hear more insights on the plan.\n\n**Cramer**: Alex, thanks for joining us. \n\n**Karp**: Thanks for having me. \n\n**Cramer**: I\u2019m a full blown retar-... scuse me, redditor now, and the question everyone is dying to ask is \u201cwhat\u2019s with that hair?\u201c\n\n**Karp**: You look at what Einstein has done, he made huge breakthroughs that changed the world.  That\u2019s what we\u2019re poised to do here at Palantir. And my hair is a nod to that brilliance.  Crazy hair is brilliance in the making. \n\n**Cramer**: In the live WSB discussions about 500 people are yelling that hair is an autist move. Thoughts on their reaction?\n\n**Karp**: I have Aspergers. Like I fucking care.  \n\n**Cramer**: Your margins and revenue beat expectations in Q1. Your stock has since doubled. The short position has also gone up by 10x doubting your Phase 2 expansion. Walk us through your next plan.\n\n**Karp**: We call it Project GOTS. We built teams and a strategy to focus on addressing more purpose built applications to aim at a few sectors. Healthcare, CPGs, HR and Energy. \n\nThese are underserved markets in dire need to make sense of their data in a more efficient way. Our product lines Gainer, Opus, Target, and Synergize will address these areas.\n\n**Cramer**: That\u2019s fantastic. And sounds intere... wait a minute WSB live is going nuts again. They\u2019re all spamming... umm, we heh, can\u2019t say this on the air. Umm, can you inform the audience on the Phase 1 product lines?\n\n**Karp**: Yes. Phase 1 was mainly to serve the broad areas: enterprise data, expanding data analytics and Saas management. Our product lines are called Foundry, Apollo, Gotham.\n\n**Cramer**: Wow, was that on purpose?\n\n**Karp**: Yes, we wanted to get into areas that were...\n\n**Cramer**: No, I\u2019m talking about the names.\n\n**Karp**: What about the names? Our employees voted to name our product lines.\n\n**Cramer**: So you\u2019re saying, you have a company culture that promotes F.A.G. products. And your phase 2...\n\n**Karp**: Yes, Tesla wanted to literally sell sex. We were inspired.\n\n**Cramer**: So you want to sell a bunch of F.A.G.G.O.T.S.\n\n**Karp**: As much as possible.\n\n**Cramer**: Wow.\n\n**Karp**: Look. We are focused on doing the impossible. And being the most important software of the 21st century. Our product lines are unified to address that.\n\n**Cramer**: They certainly are. Nobody can deny that naming convention.\n\n**Karp**: We knew there would be controversy. But just like anything bold and risky, it\u2019s free advertising. You might think it\u2019s a dumb move but you are already giving me free press. Pretty soon every man, woman and child know we are in the business of F.A.G.G.O.T.S.\n\n**Cramer**: Huh. I hadn\u2019t thought of it that way.\n\n**Karp**: No shit. It\u2019s kind of like my hair. Looks awful at first glance, but the more you think, you realize it\u2019s brilliant.\n\n**Cramer**: I wish I had hair. \n\n**Karp**: OK Boomer.\n\n**Cramer**: What?\n\n**Karp**: OK Cramer.\n\n**Cramer**: Haupt91 in the chat has said, \u201cis Gainer a diss on Gay Bear? They sound similar.\u201d\n\n**Karp**: This guy fucks... Gay bears to be specific. Yes, we wanted our own \u201cshort shorts\u201d like Elon. Why not have a slight to our doubters right in the name.\n\n**Cramer**: Amazing and unique strategy. I know you are a busy man, so, Alex, thanks so much your your time. This is very informative. \n\n**Karp**: The business world will be swimming in F.A.G.G.O.T.S. Just watch. It\u2019ll be an exciting business terraform that no one will forget.\n\n**Cramer**: Thanks for tuning in to Mad Money.
