The Crop Sciences division accounts for roughly 45% of the revenue and was given a boost after the takeover of Monsanto back in 2018. The division Pharmaceuticals focuses on the development of new treatments and accounts for 41% of the revenue.The division healthcare produces Bayer's classics that are no longer patent protected like aspirin and probably heroin too.\n\n\\*\\*Why does Bayer trade under 50 right now?\\*\\*  \nThis is a good one; back in 2018 Bayer AG took over Monsanto aka the monster that brought Roundup upon us. Even though Roundup is still freely available in most European countries, Americans have collectively decided that Roundup is evil. This is mostly because it gave them the opportunity to sue Bayer and get tendies. After all,  american courthouses are the States' favorite casinos, in a close second to WSB.  Sue anyone over anything and get tendies. Just a few months ago it started to look like the American government was about to come to a mindblowing settlement of 12 billion dollars.\n\nIn the process of coming to a settlement Bayer stock came close to its pre-covid price of 80. Then, a bunch of States decided that 12 billion is **insufficient,** refused to settle for now and are aiming for more tendies. This caused the Bayer stock to fall back to 40 which is obviously unreasonably low despite the round-up process.  Before Bayer took over Monsanto and got dragged into the whole round-up nonsense Bayer traded between 110 and 120 per share. Even now, when Bayer trades around 40-50 the numbers are looking quite steady.\n\n\\*\\*Numbers;\\*\\*  \nAlthough I  am convinced half the people on this sub can barely read or count numbers without an abbacus I'll bless the more gifted ones with some numbers.\n\n||*2017*|*2018*|*2019*|*2020*|*2021* *exp*.|*2022 exp.*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Ebitda M**|9288|14685|11503|11599|11649|12419|\n|**Operating result M**|8391|8333|9709|7899|7491|8604|\n|**Earnings before Tax M**|3122|6212|8668|7309|6483|7929|\n|**Net profit M**|5881|5589|6285|6102|5994|6617|\n|**p/e**|15,69|10,20|11,38|7,77|7,69|7,11|\n|**p/share**|6,63|5,94|6,4|6,31|6,38|6,9|\n\nNot looking too bad right?
