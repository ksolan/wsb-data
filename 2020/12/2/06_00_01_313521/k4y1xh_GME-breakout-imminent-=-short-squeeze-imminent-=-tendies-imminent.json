Here\u2019s an excerpt from our resident astrologist** [u/JayAreW](https://www.reddit.com/u/JayAreW/)**:**\n\n>Ignoring the short squeeze element of GME and just looking at chart action, there are two elements that are important to keep track of. The cup and handle pattern and $15.80.While my trading style is 90% technical analysis, there are certain elements which I shy away from \u2013 mainly chart patterns. However, it is important to at least recognize the obvious ones because if you see it, chances are others see it too. The main pattern I keep an eye out for are the massive cup and handle patterns. This is an example from Pring [figure 1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103438112030760/cup_and_handle_pring_fig_1.PNG).The buy signal is traditionally a breakout above the handle, and a good estimate for price target is the distance from the base of the cup to the handle, added to the breakout point. A recent example of this is \\[redacted\\][(daily - figure 2)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103467937988628/jmia_cup_and_handle_fig_2.PNG). Notice not one, but two failures to break the top of the handle and the subsequent parabolic run. Compare \\[redacted\\] with $GME and you see almost the same pattern [(daily \u2013 figure 3)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103497926082580/gme_cup_and_handle.PNG). The traditional buy signal would be a breach above the red line (\\~$15.80). The difference between \\[redacted\\] and $GME is that \\[redacted\\] was far more condensed; the pattern played out over a period of a few months where $GME\u2019s cup and handle started in late 2019. Playing this pattern exclusively, I would expect a price target of roughly $27, stretched out over a period of weeks/months and not as explosive as it\u2019s African counterpart (assuming a squeeze doesn't happen between now and then). Typically, any chart pattern calls for a retest of the breakout point, so don\u2019t be surprised if $GME retraces to $15.80 and look for a bounce there as confirmation that the breakout is on. The other important element is the $15.80 price. Not only is it the breakout point for the cup and handle pattern, but it coincides to a price point which I believe was a major short-selling entry point [(fig 4)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103538602442812/GME_big_short.PNG). Notice the nearly 20% gap down on 33 million of volume. This type of action doesn\u2019t just happen with selling alone and I believe massive short positions were opened on that day.This $15.80 then represents a breaking even point for those shorts if they have not closed their positions (and we have no real reason to believe they have). Breaking even is a huge psychological barrier for people when a trade isn\u2019t going their way and often times represents an exit point for crowded positions. Most of the shorts were already underwater - above $15.80 and that water begins to boil. I believe this position is becoming borderline untenable for existing short positions and is a crowded and disastrous trade. So to recap, $15.80 not only serves as an important chart pattern breakout point, but the proverbial \u201cline in the sand\u201d for existing short positions.\n\nExtreme TL;DR = Current cup and handle pattern of GME means if there is a bounce at $15.80, that means breakout is imminent.\n\nAnd lo and behold, what do we see? The markets ended at $15.80 on the dot, and the afterhours pricing is already back up to $15.92, as foretold by [u/JayAreW](https://www.reddit.com/u/JayAreW/).\n\nWhat will happen when there is a breakout? Apparently through TA our resident prophet figured out the breakeven point for short sellers is $15.80, and if GME passes the test at the $15.80 support level and begins to climb again, short sellers are gonna start panicking and start buying back share en masse, which will drive the short squeeze. Ooorrrrrr, they can short even MORE to try and squash the price down, but come earnings report on Dec 8th, if either the report was better than expected, or if Cohen, the dude who built a billion dollar fucking dog food company, does a hostile take over for GME due to less than stellar reports, again, that's a catalyst for the stocks to go up, leading again to short sellers getting fucked if they don't start buying back shares.  \n\n\nIf we autistic fucks can see this and figure this out, then FOR SURE the institutions and investment firms who shorted GME can see this and figure this out too. So their move is to keep shorting and not break the line as a whole and hope that we bow out and panic sell. And what are we waitinf for? We're waiting for the firms to panic, break rank, and start to buy up shares to cover their puts. So literally this situation is like two armies staring at each other, each waiting for the other to break their line first and turn tail and run. IT'S A FUCKING WESTERN SHOW DOWN. \n\nThat is why, for all you paper hand mofos, literally stop it. Stop it. Stop selling and HOLD FOR AT LEAST A MONTH YOU PANSY BITCHES! Don't you realize the investment firms are scared, fund managers are gonna get fired if the short squeeze happens, so they're doing everything in their power to keep prices down by shorting, wanting cause fear among average joe retail investors like us? This is the wealth transfer from the 1% back to the common people we've been waiting for! If ONLY y'all don't bitch out and stand the line strong! Just be patient and if calls are too risky, just fuking buy shares then! Then you can factor out the risk of time and just enjoy the tendies at the end of the month!\n\nLastly, just like what Citron did to PLTR, plain old market manipulation by publishing a bogus report and price target on PLTR and taking money from all the paper hand bitches here, I'd expect desperate boomer firms to try some equal bullshit in scaring you all to selling. Just expect it to come and HOLD DAMN IT.
