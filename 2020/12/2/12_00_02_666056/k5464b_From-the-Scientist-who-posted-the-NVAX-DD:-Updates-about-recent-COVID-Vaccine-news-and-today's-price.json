{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I've gotten numerous questions about what to make of the last few trading days for $NVAX, as well as $MRNA and $BNTX so I thought it might be useful to give an update on recent developments in the COVID vaccine race and how I'm interpreting them. \n\nI've already made two long posts ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k35zlh/followup_dd_from_an_actual_scientist_about_nvax/)) about why I think NVAX is the best vaccine stock and as of today have over 60k invested in stocks/options (proof at the end) so I'm not gonna try to pretend that I'm not biased towards NVAX. \n\nBut with that in mind, I still thought this might help NVAX/MRNA/BNTX holders because I think the next month is gonna to be crazy for all three stocks (less so PFE/JNJ/AZN) and I don't know of too many good sources of information for the typical retail investor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Today's action**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/klvnkgq07p261.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=764ddb3dca038a8382c83f4baf5e7724b3659498\n\nI think today was just a pullback from the big moves over the last few days bc I couldn't find anything that would have cause all three stocks to drop. Please let me know if I'm missing something.\n\nAlthough all three stocks followed the same pattern at the start of the day, MRNA's selloff seemed to accelerate right around 12:30pm, which coincided with an interview of Moderna's President Stephen Hoge as part of the Evercore ISI annual health conference ([webcast link](https://wsw.com/webcast/evercore11/mrna/2356374); requires name and email to view video). I don't know if the two things are related, but comments he made during the interview were picked up:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b4nj6sfv9p261.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e35b8a2b3b91782bb2e12fc2d3b145118111bd2\n\nWhether or not I'm overinterpreting the two events, there were a couple of important things that came up during the interview that might be of interest for MRNA holders:\n\n1. In my first post, I talked about how the 95% efficacy for MRNA that's been widely circulated only refers to prevention of symptomatic disease and not prevention of infection. Well this was the opening topic and I wonder whether this was the first time some people realized that the reported 95% efficacy didn't refer to infections and prompted an overreaction. I think Hoge did a good job in navigating the questions and made it clear that they'll be reporting that data as a secondary endpoint from the trial.\n2. Manufacturing capacity was another big topic and Hoge said that the upper end of the 500M to 1B doses they're estimating for 2021 isn't going to happen unless everything goes perfectly. He said that the 500M estimate was more reasonable and to my ear seemed to be hedging quite a bit, making me question whether 500M is going to be difficult to achieve.\n3. They expect to have 20M doses by the end of the year\n4. No safety issues have been observed and we know that the vast majority of safety issues with other vaccines present within the first few weeks (can't remember the exact timeframe).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-starts-rolling-review-janssens-covid-19-vaccine-ad26cov2s) was the only other thing that I could find that may have impacted NVAX/MRNA/BNTX:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2eqpfyvdp261.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=04d371b1d37789aaac21b5e1ab1d0cbe0d999242\n\nI haven't spent a lot of time talking about JNJ, as their Phase 3 trial was halted in October due to a case of transverse myelitis and everything I've read suggests that they're not going to be able to apply for emergency use authorization until mid-1Q 2021. I have to get more caught up on JNJ to figure out the implications of their progress, but my impression until now has been that they're behind. That however might not be the case outside of the US, and if so, maybe this news was relevant for NVAX/MRNA/BNTX. I'm skeptical bc I saw almost zero discussion of this, but I think it warrants some consideration. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Important Upcoming Catalysts\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Emergency use authorization announcements**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46ib0ermgp261.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4277928982b4a55ee00ae31a97ce48ae26610db\n\n[Link](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article247526955.html). I think this is just an attempt to reassure the public that they're not going to take any shortcuts. I think it's extremely unlikely that both of the mRNA vaccines don't get emergency use authorization given their high efficacy rates and reportedly good safety profiles in the middle of a pandemic. We'll know based on the AdComm meetings on December 10th for PFE/BNTX and December 17th for MRNA. \n\nThis is obviously a positive catalyst for MRNA/BNTX, but I have no idea how much they'll run-up to the announcement and how much of them getting approval is already priced in. As far as how this impacts NVAX, I think we might see a small pullback if positive announcements but I honestly have no idea what will happen. I tend to think this won't matter much for NVAX since it's been clear for a long time that they're behind PFE/MRNA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Reactogenicity of mRNA vaccines** \n\nSomething that I think is completely off the radar but I think is going to be a huge deal within the next month is the fact that mRNA vaccines have significantly more reactogenicity than the vaccines most people are used to. Reactogenicity includes symptoms like injection site pain, swelling, fever, and fatigue; symptoms that are unpleasant but not dangerous. \n\nIf you're an investor in MRNA/BNTX, don't shrug this off. This [article](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6520/1022) published in Science is what convinced me there's trouble ahead and this can't be ignored:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3x3lxf9klp261.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a89fca405b51b1bafcb3e9fccebd11f870bbd39\n\nHere are a couple of quotes from the article:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>... after the second injection, his arm swelled up to the size of a \u201cgoose egg,\u201d ...  within a few hours, Hutchison, who was healthy and 43, was beset by bone and muscle aches and a 38.9\u00b0C fever. \u201cI started shaking. I had cold and hot rushes,\u201d he says. \u201c**I was sitting by the phone all night long thinking: \u2018Should I call 911**?\u2019\u201d   \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Hutchison's symptoms resolved after 12 hours. But, he says, \u201c**Nobody prepared me for the severity of this**.\u201d He says the public should be better prepared than he was, because a subset of people may face intense, if transient, side effects, called reactogenicity, from Moderna's vaccine. Some health experts agree.   \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\u201c**Somebody needs to address the elephant**: What about vaccine reactogenicity? While it's \u2026 not going to cause any long-term issues \u2026 how is that perception going to go with the public once they start receiving it?\u201d asks Deborah Fuller, a vaccinologist at the University of Washington, Seattle, whose lab is developing second-generation RNA vaccines against COVID-19. She worries the side effects could feed vaccine hesitancy. \u201c**I feel like it's being glossed over**.\u201d   \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Most people will escape \u201csevere\u201d side effects, defined as those that prevent daily activity. Fewer than 2% of recipients of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines developed severe fevers of 39\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C. But if the companies win regulatory approvals, they're aiming to supply vaccine to 35 million people worldwide by the end of December. **If 2% experienced severe fever, that would be 700,000 people.**   \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Hausman also sees a need to support people who have serious reactions. **For example, people may need \u201ca hotline with a nurse triaging \u2026** **figuring out if you need to go to the hospital or not. Will your medical expenses be covered if you do?** These are important questions.\u201d \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not trying to contribute to fear mongering or indirectly help my NVAX investment by highlighting this (although these issues are part of what made me invest in NVAX in the first place). That's all from an article published in Science which would be one of the last sources that would ever be interested in reducing vaccine acceptance.\n\nThe bottom line is the US, vaccine skepticism and misinformation - particularly about COVID vaccines - is higher than ever. What's going to happen once the people being injected aren't clinical trial participants and instead include people that are reluctant/skeptical? Even if the rate of severe reactogenicity is only 1%, that's going to be a lot of sources for news stories \"about new untested mRNA vaccines\" and a lot people sharing horrible experiences on social media if millions get vaccinated. \n\nI think this could hit BNTX/MRNA hard if it becomes a big story line. Still probably some gains to be had in the runup to the EUA announcement, but I would be real careful if I was holding options once we get further into December and the probability of this as a story line increases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NVAX + Positions update**\n\nAssuming the below screenshot supposedly from JPM is [real](https://twitter.com/MaxSpeculation/status/1333956816187875328/photo/1) (I can't find the original source), NVAX lowered the interim update trigger from 66 events to 50 events in their Phase 3 UK trial, which means we'll get the interim update sooner that what was originally stated in the clinical trial protocol. Their head of R&D said they'd do this last week, so I suspect this is legit but no guarantees.\n\nIn case you're not familiar, the interim update is when we'll get the first readout on efficacy. If it's good (90-95%) then I think the stock goes up massively. So I'll be holding through that announcement pretty much no matter what happens from here on out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qfzjp8efxp261.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=69fd7eab831c142ce03165be381c891ee54b00e8\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're holding options that expire on December 18th, then I might consider rolling them to January bc it will be cutting it close. My plan is to actively trade the December options and keep building my core position in January calls so I give myself enough breathing room for the announcement in case it doesn't come in December. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojhduf3vtp261.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f7aed5054f1965cc9881274087cca2b06ec6782\n\nI rolled a lot of gains from the last few days into these positions, so even though today I gave a lot back, I'm still up significantly since I started this trade. The reason for the weeklies is that NVAX has a couple of investor meetings coming up in the next two days and I think this rebounds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck and hope this was helpful.",

href=\"https://preview.redd.it/klvnkgq07p261.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=764ddb3dca038a8382c83f4baf5e7724b3659498\">https://preview.redd.it/klvnkgq07p261.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=764ddb3dca038a8382c83f4baf5e7724b3659498</a></p>\n\n<p>I think today was just a pullback from the big moves over the last few days bc I couldn&#39;t find anything that would have cause all three stocks to drop. Please let me know if I&#39;m missing something.</p>\n\n<p>Although all three stocks followed the same pattern at the start of the day, MRNA&#39;s selloff seemed to accelerate right around 12:30pm, which coincided with an interview of Moderna&#39;s President Stephen Hoge as part of the Evercore ISI annual health conference (<a href=\"https://wsw.com/webcast/evercore11/mrna/2356374\">webcast link</a>; requires name and email to view video). I don&#39;t know if the two things are related, but comments he made during the interview were picked up:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/b4nj6sfv9p261.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e35b8a2b3b91782bb2e12fc2d3b145118111bd2\">https://preview.redd.it/b4nj6sfv9p261.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e35b8a2b3b91782bb2e12fc2d3b145118111bd2</a></p>\n\n<p>Whether or not I&#39;m overinterpreting the two events, there were a couple of important things that came up during the interview that might be of interest for MRNA holders:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>In my first post, I talked about how the 95% efficacy for MRNA that&#39;s been widely circulated only refers to prevention of symptomatic disease and not prevention of infection. Well this was the opening topic and I wonder whether this was the first time some people realized that the reported 95% efficacy didn&#39;t refer to infections and prompted an overreaction. I think Hoge did a good job in navigating the questions and made it clear that they&#39;ll be reporting that data as a secondary endpoint from the trial.</li>\n<li>Manufacturing capacity was another big topic and Hoge said that the upper end of the 500M to 1B doses they&#39;re estimating for 2021 isn&#39;t going to happen unless everything goes perfectly. He said that the 500M estimate was more reasonable and to my ear seemed to be hedging quite a bit, making me question whether 500M is going to be difficult to achieve.</li>\n<li>They expect to have 20M doses by the end of the year</li>\n<li>No safety issues have been observed and we know that the vast majority of safety issues with other vaccines present within the first few weeks (can&#39;t remember the exact timeframe).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-starts-rolling-review-janssens-covid-19-vaccine-ad26cov2s\">This</a> was the only other thing that I could find that may have impacted NVAX/MRNA/BNTX:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/b2eqpfyvdp261.png?width=1021&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04d371b1d37789aaac21b5e1ab1d0cbe0d999242\">https://preview.redd.it/b2eqpfyvdp261.png?width=1021&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04d371b1d37789aaac21b5e1ab1d0cbe0d999242</a></p>\n\n<p>I haven&#39;t spent a lot of time talking about JNJ, as their Phase 3 trial was halted in October due to a case of transverse myelitis and everything I&#39;ve read suggests that they&#39;re not going to be able to apply for emergency use authorization until mid-1Q 2021. I have to get more caught up on JNJ to figure out the implications of their progress, but my impression until now has been that they&#39;re behind. That however might not be the case outside of the US, and if so, maybe this news was relevant for NVAX/MRNA/BNTX. I&#39;m skeptical bc I saw almost zero discussion of this, but I think it warrants some consideration. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<h1>Important Upcoming Catalysts</h1>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Emergency use authorization announcements</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/46ib0ermgp261.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4277928982b4a55ee00ae31a97ce48ae26610db\">https://preview.redd.it/46ib0ermgp261.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4277928982b4a55ee00ae31a97ce48ae26610db</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article247526955.html\">Link</a>. I think this is just an attempt to reassure the public that they&#39;re not going to take any shortcuts. I think it&#39;s extremely unlikely that both of the mRNA vaccines don&#39;t get emergency use authorization given their high efficacy rates and reportedly good safety profiles in the middle of a pandemic. We&#39;ll know based on the AdComm meetings on December 10th for PFE/BNTX and December 17th for MRNA. </p>\n\n<p>This is obviously a positive catalyst for MRNA/BNTX, but I have no idea how much they&#39;ll run-up to the announcement and how much of them getting approval is already priced in. As far as how this impacts NVAX, I think we might see a small pullback if positive announcements but I honestly have no idea what will happen. I tend to think this won&#39;t matter much for NVAX since it&#39;s been clear for a long time that they&#39;re behind PFE/MRNA.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reactogenicity of mRNA vaccines</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Something that I think is completely off the radar but I think is going to be a huge deal within the next month is the fact that mRNA vaccines have significantly more reactogenicity than the vaccines most people are used to. Reactogenicity includes symptoms like injection site pain, swelling, fever, and fatigue; symptoms that are unpleasant but not dangerous. </p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re an investor in MRNA/BNTX, don&#39;t shrug this off. This <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6520/1022\">article</a> published in Science is what convinced me there&#39;s trouble ahead and this can&#39;t be ignored:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3x3lxf9klp261.png?width=594&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a89fca405b51b1bafcb3e9fccebd11f870bbd39\">https://preview.redd.it/3x3lxf9klp261.png?width=594&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a89fca405b51b1bafcb3e9fccebd11f870bbd39</a></p>\n\n<p>Here are a couple of quotes from the article:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>... after the second injection, his arm swelled up to the size of a \u201cgoose egg,\u201d ...  within a few hours, Hutchison, who was healthy and 43, was beset by bone and muscle aches and a 38.9\u00b0C fever. \u201cI started shaking. I had cold and hot rushes,\u201d he says. \u201c<strong>I was sitting by the phone all night long thinking: \u2018Should I call 911</strong>?\u2019\u201d   </p>\n\n<p>Hutchison&#39;s symptoms resolved after 12 hours. But, he says, \u201c<strong>Nobody prepared me for the severity of this</strong>.\u201d He says the public should be better prepared than he was, because a subset of people may face intense, if transient, side effects, called reactogenicity, from Moderna&#39;s vaccine. Some health experts agree.   </p>\n\n<p>\u201c<strong>Somebody needs to address the elephant</strong>: What about vaccine reactogenicity? While it&#39;s \u2026 not going to cause any long-term issues \u2026 how is that perception going to go with the public once they start receiving it?\u201d asks Deborah Fuller, a vaccinologist at the University of Washington, Seattle, whose lab is developing second-generation RNA vaccines against COVID-19. She worries the side effects could feed vaccine hesitancy. \u201c<strong>I feel like it&#39;s being glossed over</strong>.\u201d   </p>\n\n<p>Most people will escape \u201csevere\u201d side effects, defined as those that prevent daily activity. Fewer than 2% of recipients of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines developed severe fevers of 39\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C. But if the companies win regulatory approvals, they&#39;re aiming to supply vaccine to 35 million people worldwide by the end of December. <strong>If 2% experienced severe fever, that would be 700,000 people.</strong>   </p>\n\n<p>Hausman also sees a need to support people who have serious reactions. <strong>For example, people may need \u201ca hotline with a nurse triaging \u2026</strong> <strong>figuring out if you need to go to the hospital or not. Will your medical expenses be covered if you do?</strong> These are important questions.\u201d </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not trying to contribute to fear mongering or indirectly help my NVAX investment by highlighting this (although these issues are part of what made me invest in NVAX in the first place). That&#39;s all from an article published in Science which would be one of the last sources that would ever be interested in reducing vaccine acceptance.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is the US, vaccine skepticism and misinformation - particularly about COVID vaccines - is higher than ever. What&#39;s going to happen once the people being injected aren&#39;t clinical trial participants and instead include people that are reluctant/skeptical? Even if the rate of severe reactogenicity is only 1%, that&#39;s going to be a lot of sources for news stories &quot;about new untested mRNA vaccines&quot; and a lot people sharing horrible experiences on social media if millions get vaccinated. </p>\n\n<p>I think this could hit BNTX/MRNA hard if it becomes a big story line. Still probably some gains to be had in the runup to the EUA announcement, but I would be real careful if I was holding options once we get further into December and the probability of this as a story line increases.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>NVAX + Positions update</strong></p>\n\n<p>Assuming the below screenshot supposedly from JPM is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaxSpeculation/status/1333956816187875328/photo/1\">real</a> (I can&#39;t find the original source), NVAX lowered the interim update trigger from 66 events to 50 events in their Phase 3 UK trial, which means we&#39;ll get the interim update sooner that what was originally stated in the clinical trial protocol. Their head of R&amp;D said they&#39;d do this last week, so I suspect this is legit but no guarantees.</p>\n\n<p>In case you&#39;re not familiar, the interim update is when we&#39;ll get the first readout on efficacy. If it&#39;s good (90-95%) then I think the stock goes up massively. So I&#39;ll be holding through that announcement pretty much no matter what happens from here on out. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qfzjp8efxp261.png?width=582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69fd7eab831c142ce03165be381c891ee54b00e8\">https://preview.redd.it/qfzjp8efxp261.png?width=582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69fd7eab831c142ce03165be381c891ee54b00e8</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re holding options that expire on December 18th, then I might consider rolling them to January bc it will be cutting it close. My plan is to actively trade the December options and keep building my core position in January calls so I give myself enough breathing room for the announcement in case it doesn&#39;t come in December. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ojhduf3vtp261.png?width=1055&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f7aed5054f1965cc9881274087cca2b06ec6782\">https://preview.redd.it/ojhduf3vtp261.png?width=1055&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f7aed5054f1965cc9881274087cca2b06ec6782</a></p>\n\n<p>I rolled a lot of gains from the last few days into these positions, so even though today I gave a lot back, I&#39;m still up significantly since I started this trade. The reason for the weeklies is that NVAX has a couple of investor meetings coming up in the next two days and I think this rebounds.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Good luck and hope this was helpful.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false,
