They have NO working technology. They don't have a proper chassis, so the Tre uses an Iveco chassis. They have no battery so they are stuck white labeling Romeo modules in a horrendous pack design. \n\n So, a little background on battery design. When you are designing a battery you have two separate things that you have to account for: capacity, which gives you range, and voltage, which allows you to provide necessary power. You get both of these by connecting together cells. \n\n There are two different ways you can connect cells: In parallel, which increases capacity while keeping voltage unchanged, or in series which increases capacity AND voltage. An automotive scale battery will have cells connected in parallel and then those groups in series. \n\n The problem comes when, like Nikola, you are stuck using off the shelf modules: For these, the cell groups are already set for you and you are stuck with them. If it isn't what you need for your battery design, you're stuck. This is why custom battery design is crucial. \n\n In the case of Nikola, the Hermes modules they are using from Romeo Power have a capacity of 10 kWh and have a voltage of about 100 V when topped off.  To power their truck, they need 800V, so that's 8 modules connected in series. \n\n But this sets the capacity for them: 8 modules of 10 kWh each comes out to 80 kWh. While that is a great number for the passenger vehicles that Romeo presumably designed these modules for, it isn't nearly enough for a semi truck. The Tre needs 720 kWh \n\nSo they need 72 Hermes modules. But they can't just put them in series or the voltage will be 7200 Volts, far too much to be safe in an EV. So it is impossible to properly design a battery pack using these modules, and Nikola was forced to improperly design one. \n\n**NIKOLA TWO**\n\nIt has only been on the road once, when they delivered a nearly empty load of beer a couple of miles for a publicity stunt.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSiWPNe2llU&feature=emb\\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSiWPNe2llU&feature=emb_logo)\n\n1. The range extender power was dramatically reduced. \n\n2. The battery was made smaller, which not only decreases electric range but also available power.  \n\n3. Nikola most likely replaced the power cells of the One with energy cells in the Two.  \n\n4. They replaced the two speed transmission with a single speed.  \n\nTwo speed gearboxes are hard, so Nikola just dropped it. Now, you would be able to make up for the loss of the second gear by just cranking up the power (this is Tesla's approach) but instead Nikola REDUCED the power. The result is this hapless machine that can't go on the road. \n\nNikola spent two or three precious years making an utterly failed design that they can't do anything with except creep around the parking lot with guests while they shout above the howl of the radiator fans.  \n\nThe truck is worthless. Completely road unworthy, by their own admission. It has only been on the road once, when they delivered a nearly empty load of beer a couple of miles for a publicity stunt.
