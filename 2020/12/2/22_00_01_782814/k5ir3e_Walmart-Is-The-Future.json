That might seem ridiculous but it is entirely possible. If you think this is bullshit I encourage you to read the three news articles below and my in depth analysis of the stock.\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to read (references and today\u2019s news):\n\n[Understanding Walmart Plus](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joannasciarrino/2020/09/15/walmart-plus-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-walmart-delivery-service/?sh=2acacc8b1085)\n\n[Today\u2019s Walmart Plus News](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/walmart-plus-shipping-minimum-holidays-2020-12-1029855902)\n\n[Walmart Pharmacy New EVP And Plan](https://www.grocerydive.com/news/walmart-names-evp-of-health-and-wellness/591437/)\n\n[Walmart Opening Pharmacies](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-investing/articles/walmart-to-open-health-superstores-what-it-means-for-real-estate-investors/)\n\n\n\nMy Findings:\n\n1. Walmart is really pushing their new online store service Walmart Plus. Walmart Plus is like Amazon prime except Walmart Plus offers same day or next day shipping for free on any purchase and same day free grocery delivery. They are one of the only companies in the world that can do this because of their nationwide retail stores. Walmart retail stores near almost every town which allows for the faster delivery than Amazon. This faster delivery will entice people to join Walmart plus and gives them an advantage over Amazon. Faster delivery allows for them to ship perishable goods like groceries because they will stay fresh during the same day shipping. Walmart also can keep costs at a minimum for the service. Unlike Amazon they do not need to pay for huge warehouses and warehouse employees because they have many stores already established. Amazon also has to ship your products across the country first in a semi truck to a warehouse, then from the warehouse onto a separate delivery truck that goes to your house. Amazon has to pay Warehouse costs which include property taxes, upkeep, and the huge initial cost to open a warehouse. They also have to pay employees at the warehouses. They also have to pay for semi trucks, last mile delivery vans and the salaries of the employees driving them (or pay for a service like UPS).\nKeep in mind Amazon has become one of the largest companies in the world. Walmart offers faster delivery while avoiding the fees for warehouses (they use their stores instead). They also have much lower costs on delivery. (They ship your products straight from your local Walmart to your house). If Amazon has become one of the top 5 companies in the world imagine the money Walmart will make by offering a similar service with faster deliveries with much less operating cost. With the bump in online sales during the Christmas season, and people turning to online shopping, Walmart can expect to gain a lot of new users on its new Walmart Plus service. They might buy tiktok too which shows their open to new and risky strategies and innovation. This makes Walmart a strong growth tech stock that could become the next Amazon.\n\n2. Walmart is making big moves in the pharmaceutical space. They are opening more pharmacies and putting money into their pharmaceutical programs Walmart announced a new Health and Wellness EVP Dr. Cheryl Pegus, the former Chief medical officer of Walgreens. They should be able to make easy money with covid vaccine distribution and start making more in the pharmaceutical space overall. They are looking to take over CVS as the largest pharmacy In America. (They are currently the second largest) Walmart also started a healthcare program looking to capitalize on the health insurance market and take some of the market from companies like blue cross. They are looking to combine their new ventures into health with Walmart Plus and roll out a program to deliver perceptions to your home. There are rumors Walmart could even be able to deliver covid vaccines to homes once they are available. Take that with a grain of salt as it has not yet been confirmed by Walmart.\n\n\n3. Walmart is the worlds largest retail chain. You would think that that they should have taken a huge hit with the pandemic like most other retail stores. They did not however and actually reported a 6% average grown in overall sales at retail stores. This is due to Walmart being an essential business because they sell groceries and other essential items. People still shopped at Walmart even with the pandemic going on which makes them a very stable stock. Just because they didn\u2019t go down with covid does not mean they won\u2019t go up when it goes away. I expect large gains in the stock once the pandemic is over. \n\n\n\nThat took hours to write so I would appreciate it if you gave it an upvote and commented your thoughts :)", "author_fullname": "t2_5dbxg6qo", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcc8Walmart Is The Future\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\ude80", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_k5ir3e", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1606944918.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\u001b201027:30:1"}], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1606972948.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Buy Walmart!\nTrust me, You don\u2019t want to miss out</p>\n\n<p>Overall:</p>\n\n<p>Walmart\u2019s new online Walmart plus service is very enticing and costs little to run compared to Amazon.
