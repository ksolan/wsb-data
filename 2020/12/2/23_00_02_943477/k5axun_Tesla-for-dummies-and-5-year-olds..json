The grid you\u2019re currently on is using technology that was developed in the 1920s. You gotta build these lines from the source plant to the homes and a significant amount of electricity will be lost in transit. On top of this, the infrastructure has been criminally neglected since 80s in the USA and elsewhere. Do you think these things are maintained? Of course somebody is maintaining them isn\u2019t it? Nope (only superficially). The California fires that PG&E plead guilty to, that killed about a hundred people in 2018 were a testament to the current state of maintenance that goes on. Link: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html)\n\nTesla is building a future where micro grids and macro grids would trade electricity. Imagine your neighborhood with solar on each roof and battery storage in each house. You\u2019ll be trading amongst yourself (neighborhood). And your neighborhood will be trading electricity with the macro grid. This is only possible with a cutting-edge AI powered software. Tesla is building it. Welcome to the glimpse of the future. This is how it will be everywhere. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) **Develop Grid Level Battery Storage**  **\u2013** In the future the majority of the energy will be obtained from Sun (think of this like indirect fusion source. Sun is a giant fusion reactor in the sky and you\u2019ll be tapping into a microscopic percentage of energy that Sun is sending towards Earth. This microscopic percentage is enough to run the entire civilization which you think utilizes gigantic amount of energy. Everything is relative. So what you\u2019re really consuming globally is laughable at the relative scale of energy Sun is sending towards your planet. \n\nSince Sun doesn\u2019t shine at night, and sometimes it\u2019s cloudy, you gotta build battery farms to store energy for night. Nothing too complicated conceptually. Tesla is building products known as Megapacks that on the face of it beat Peaker Plants that are powered by fossils in terms of cost, space required, and efficiency. The energy industry is all about cost, so Tesla has won. This revolution has just begun. Testament to Tesla\u2019s supreme product is Australia which decided to double Tesla\u2019s battery farm in terms of capacity because it saved them so many millions. The technology has been proven and Tesla is now getting contracts bigger than the previous ones every year. For instance PG&E is currently building the largest battery farm in the US using Tesla\u2019s Megapacks. This part of their business is going to be equal to auto business within this decade. Future is now, old man. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) **Develop consumer/business level battery storage \u2013** You need to have localized power generation and storage as well as grid level. This is the future. For instance, when all 2 billion of the vehicles (as of today) go electric in 30 years, the global electricity requirement is going to double. DOUBLE. So you gotta have localized storage and production. When you\u2019ll buy a new house, a significant part of the cost will be the local storage battery plant. You wouldn\u2019t buy a house that doesn\u2019t have its own plant. Tesla is building something known as Tesla Powerwalls. Again, the leading product in its segment, to address this market that has barely begun to develop. This is the future. \n\n4) **Develop solar panels and solar roofs \u2013** Cost of manufacturing solar panels at this point is the cost of doing dry walls. It\u2019s really cheap and Tesla will ride down the cost curve and be able to compete with Chinese subsidy-fuelled solar panel cost decline. This is because Tesla will be building the solar panels locally in different continents and that would trump over the logistics cost addition of importing from China. So it\u2019s up to you whether you wanna import from China or get the entire package from Tesla. Barely any difference in cost would exist. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe solar roofs do not have competition. This market does not exist. This is a very difficult product to manufacture but every rich person would get it on their roof and eventually everyone. Initially the spurt growth would come from the large builders who\u2019d be ordering en masse for large-scale projects as well as rich people. Tesla has come out with one design, soon there will be 4 and that\u2019s that. Tesla will dominate this market which they\u2019re building from scratch. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5)** **Develop company OS for running the entire company from factory to sales. (They don't use Salesforce, etc.)** **-** So you thought Tesla was using Salesforce? ;) Did you think Tesla was able to achieve the profitability and the margins and the customer satisfaction that they did with the help of Salesforce? ;) For anybody aware of the B2B software, you know how big of a deal this is. Using an industry software that\u2019s the standard prevents you from iterating quickly over your business processes. You become a slave to the features that exist in these Salesforce like software. Tesla studied all of this in 2012, and gave a public remark that you can still find, that the industry standard software would not be sufficient. They have finally realized their goal of Tesla Company OS. They run everything from factories to sales on this software. They run literally everything that Tesla does on this. This is something that other companies cannot even conceptualize to make because it\u2019s laughable generally to even think something like \u201cwe\u2019re gonna make our own business software\u201d. Imagine GM thinking this. On top of this, this Tesla Company OS engineering team is badass and they quickly iterate and add new feature and process whenever required. THIS IS THE REASON TESLA ACHIEVED PROFITIBILITY AND HIGHEST MARGINS. THIS. NOTHING ELSE. THIS SOFTWARE. (But don\u2019t tell anybody about this, okay? ;) )   \n   \n \n\n**6)** **Selling Insurance Products \u2013** Oh no, Warren. He once famously said when asked about Tesla insurance \u201can auto company is about as likely to succeeed in insurance business as an insurance company is likely to succeed in auto business\u201d. Little did he understand insurance of automobiles of the future. Tesla has all the data with regards to your cars. More data than any other insurance company can ever have. Tesla has 360\\* camera data, vehicle sensor logs, etc. All of this is proprietary. You can maybe gain access to GPS and front-cam via dash camera if you\u2019re a 3rd party insurance company, but you cannot compete with Tesla on the magnitude and diversity of data that Tesla has. Getting into insurance is a difficult process, but Tesla will prevail and eventually offer it everywhere. They\u2019re currently offering it in California only. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7)** **Develop RNA microfactories for vaccines \u2013** As per Elon, he doesn\u2019t expect this to be a big product from a finance stand-point but they\u2019re developing these machines to build cutting-edge vaccines. You can solve diseases like it\u2019s a software problem and who knows how much Tesla will decide to get into this market. They\u2019ve currently partnered with CureVac in Germany. Remember Bill Gates saying that Elon doesn\u2019t know anything about vaccines? Well, he\u2019s an idiot. Because Tesla is partnered with CureVac \u2013 a company BILL GATES IS INVESTED IN TO BUILD VACCINES. IT IS ELON WHO IS MAKING THE MACHINES THAT BUILDS VACCINES FOR BILL GATES. Idiot, consumed by jealousy. Next.   \n   \n \n\n**8)** **Materials engineering for alloys used for making their vehicles \u2013** Oh no\u2026Oh no. The material engineering is one of the most difficult things to do on this planet. There simply aren\u2019t people smart enough to even understand basics of it. Testament to this? THE TEAM THAT DOES MATERIALS ENGINEERING FOR SPACEX is the same team that does it for Tesla. Why? Nobody else knows how to do it. Please contact Tesla if you know how to do it. These alloys add to the advantage of safety and weight of their vehicles. Furthermore, the armor glass which will be built of Cybertruck is not something you can just buy off the self. This is the latest thing they\u2019re building. Don\u2019t tell anybody that Tesla uses its own alloys. This is a secret between you and I. ;) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**9)** **Develop next-gen capital machinery for their next-gen factories \u2013** Why do you think Tesla acquired the Grohmann Automation? They keep making these acquisitions but nobody wants to pay attention. The vehicles that are coming off the lines require machinery that doesn\u2019t exist - for manufacturing. Tesla does this in-house. An exception to this is the giant casting machines that are being purchased from Italy. On the whole, Tesla is bringing the dawn of automotive manufacturing revolution finally in 2021. The sheer re-imagining of car manufacturing is a little scary for the rest of the industry so they want to ignore this. Model Y that will be built in 2021 in Germany will be structurally different from the one in USA and China. This is because of the giant casting machines. Anyway, so the bottom line is Tesla is reimagining how manufacturing is done and this sounds simple but is a monumental thing that nobody else wants to embark on. Those companies like VW do something known as catalog engineering. This is when you buy a catalogue magazine and order the machines with pretty pictures. Then you are slave to the machines that you\u2019ve purchased for manufacturing cars. Elon has repeatedly said since 2 years, that Tesla\u2019s long term advantage is not software (it is not the #1 according to him) but rather manufacturing. How can this be? Isn\u2019t Tesla a noob? Well, people are in for a surprise. Tesla is going to out-manufacture the rest of the industry. You cannot beat this advantage. Other companies literally won\u2019t have the machines that Tsla is using to build their vehicles. How do you compete?   \n   \n \n\n**10)**  **Develop FSD Compuer Chip (their own silicon like Apple's M1) \u2013** So we\u2019re talking about industry leading inference chip that is based on an important concept of redundancy. There are two redundant CPUs in there because of which you\u2019re fine if one fails. You can run FSD software locally and very safely. This is cryptographically signed, so you cannot just reverse-engineer it and put it in your copy-cat car. No chip competes with Tesla\u2019s in terms of the wattage consumed and in terms of compute ability. FSD requires a great inference computer and while this capacity hasn\u2019t been yet full utilized as the chip is too strong and software still nascent, it will be soon. Nvidia has promised to come out with \u201cbetter chip\u201d next to next year but alas, by the end of 2021, Tesla would be coming out with the next gen FSD Inference Computer Chip. This will already beat anything that is in development right now. They win again on the in-car computer. Now you would like to think only in terms of compute advantage, but think deeply about wattage problem. The more the chip consumes the less the car has range. Tesla\u2019s range doesn\u2019t just come from the best-in-industry motors but from a lot of places. FSD computer is one great contributor to the high overall range. Other companies will be using third party stuff that will be generalized and power hungry. Ouch. They lose again. On fundamentals, let\u2019s not even talk about compute\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**11)**  **Develop Super-Computer with proprietary silicon for neural network training like Google's TPU** **- \"Tesla Dojo\"** **-** So this is something the industry hadn\u2019t even conceptualized because they were debating whether Lidar is good or bad. Tesla is building the most powerful supercomputer that will be on the exaFlop level. This is not something that anybody can just venture into. Tesla is building their own silicon for this and this computer will be live next year (towards end). In order to achieve FSD you need to turn road driving into a game. You gotta make everything from collection of data to processing and training neural networks to updating cars automatic. This is not currently possible. But Tesla will make it possible with this computer. THIS IS A GOD DAMN SUPER COMPUTER LITERALLY SUPER COMPUTER that is BETTER THAN WHAT IS OUT THERE. The current TOP SUPER COMPUTER is ABOUT HALF THAT OF 1 exaFLOP. Good luck competing with this. Also, Google and AWS have been put on watch because Elon publically said that this computer is going to be offered as AWS-like service as well. Please continute debating Lidar while Elon takes over the world via this Skynet Cyberdyne System.   \n   \n \n\n**12)**  **Mine lithium \u2013** Hold your horses, it\u2019s getting a little crazy. Tesla just purchased 10,000 acres in Nevada to mine lithium using Table Salt. TABLE SALT. So well, they\u2019ve already come up with a revolutionary way to mine lithium and they will be more efficient therefore save more on cost. So they\u2019ll have this interesting advantage. Obviously, eventually, they\u2019ll move into more aspects of mining and and processing and keep on increasing their cost advantage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**13)**  **Manufacture cells, modules, batteries \u2013** Please refer to the Battery Day Presentation, they will dominate. They\u2019re going to be structurally putting the batteries in the structure of the vehicles itself. What this means is that there won\u2019t be battery boxes inside your car, but rather that battery cells will be integrated as part of the car structure. This is the transition that occurred in planes. The fuel is now part of the wings. This was earlier not the case. The dry electrode technology that Tesla is going to be using in their cells is going to get rid of the ovens that are required. This in and of itself is going to enable them to have terawatt level manufacturing since you need such a small space and your process speed is increased by many multiples. There is no way to explain cells without going technical so just know this that Tesla\u2019s cells are going to be the industry leading. They won\u2019t be able to produce them enough for a very long time so initially these will be put into their higher-end vehicles.\n\n**The rest of the points are self-explanatory.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: Invest in GM, Ford, VW, etc. Short Tesla.**", "author_fullname": "t2_7q93u7us", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Tesla for dummies and 5 year olds.", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 118, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"8eu1y40uhs261": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 91, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8eu1y40uhs261.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=7f94bb9297d072ecde125a914327d8f0b48b558f"}, {"y": 183, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8eu1y40uhs261.jpg?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c5d198674b002066f29bdc16b545a6f7e027b539"}, {"y": 271, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8eu1y40uhs261.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0eb99cbe830de03318e970b2f01db77d2cd27518"}, {"y": 542, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8eu1y40uhs261.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0a1b5a59aeb80c71bbf8c0bb44711552f66a446b"}, {"y": 813, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8eu1y40uhs261.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f0b8c61cdc560c52e032e3688c427b42f2c43c83"}], "s": {"y": 828, "x": 977, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8eu1y40uhs261.jpg?width=977&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=874bd5b0445835ea5333b36d153ed8d7fdf23f62"}, "id": "8eu1y40uhs261"}}, "name": "t3_k5axun", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 56, "total_awards_received": 2, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": true, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 56, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/X6xgpy6c6_p83EPFTotP-e4L6429JgJWjDg6PNyK0MY.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1606950624.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Image:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8eu1y40uhs261.jpg?width=977&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=874bd5b0445835ea5333b36d153ed8d7fdf23f62\">Root</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tesla for dummies and 5 year olds.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>1) <strong>Develop software for Grid for trading electricity</strong> - </p>\n\n<p>Name is \u201cAutobidder\u201d.

FSD requires a great inference computer and while this capacity hasn\u2019t been yet full utilized as the chip is too strong and software still nascent, it will be soon. Nvidia has promised to come out with \u201cbetter chip\u201d next to next year but alas, by the end of 2021, Tesla would be coming out with the next gen FSD Inference Computer Chip. This will already beat anything that is in development right now. They win again on the in-car computer. Now you would like to think only in terms of compute advantage, but think deeply about wattage problem. The more the chip consumes the less the car has range. Tesla\u2019s range doesn\u2019t just come from the best-in-industry motors but from a lot of places. FSD computer is one great contributor to the high overall range. Other companies will be using third party stuff that will be generalized and power hungry. Ouch. They lose again. On fundamentals, let\u2019s not even talk about compute</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>11)</strong>  <strong>Develop Super-Computer with proprietary silicon for neural network training like Google&#39;s TPU</strong> <strong>- &quot;Tesla Dojo&quot;</strong> <strong>-</strong> So this is something the industry hadn\u2019t even conceptualized because they were debating whether Lidar is good or bad. Tesla is building the most powerful supercomputer that will be on the exaFlop level. This is not something that anybody can just venture into. Tesla is building their own silicon for this and this computer will be live next year (towards end). In order to achieve FSD you need to turn road driving into a game. You gotta make everything from collection of data to processing and training neural networks to updating cars automatic. This is not currently possible. But Tesla will make it possible with this computer. THIS IS A GOD DAMN SUPER COMPUTER LITERALLY SUPER COMPUTER that is BETTER THAN WHAT IS OUT THERE. The current TOP SUPER COMPUTER is ABOUT HALF THAT OF 1 exaFLOP. Good luck competing with this. Also, Google and AWS have been put on watch because Elon publically said that this computer is going to be offered as AWS-like service as well. Please continute debating Lidar while Elon takes over the world via this Skynet Cyberdyne System.   </p>\n\n<p><strong>12)</strong>  <strong>Mine lithium \u2013</strong> Hold your horses, it\u2019s getting a little crazy. Tesla just purchased 10,000 acres in Nevada to mine lithium using Table Salt. TABLE SALT. So well, they\u2019ve already come up with a revolutionary way to mine lithium and they will be more efficient therefore save more on cost. So they\u2019ll have this interesting advantage. Obviously, eventually, they\u2019ll move into more aspects of mining and and processing and keep on increasing their cost advantage. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>13)</strong>  <strong>Manufacture cells, modules, batteries \u2013</strong> Please refer to the Battery Day Presentation, they will dominate. They\u2019re going to be structurally putting the batteries in the structure of the vehicles itself. What this means is that there won\u2019t be battery boxes inside your car, but rather that battery cells will be integrated as part of the car structure. This is the transition that occurred in planes. The fuel is now part of the wings. This was earlier not the case. The dry electrode technology that Tesla is going to be using in their cells is going to get rid of the ovens that are required. This in and of itself is going to enable them to have terawatt level manufacturing since you need such a small space and your process speed is increased by many multiples. There is no way to explain cells without going technical so just know this that Tesla\u2019s cells are going to be the industry leading. They won\u2019t be able to produce them enough for a very long time so initially these will be put into their higher-end vehicles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The rest of the points are self-explanatory.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: Invest in GM, Ford, VW, etc. Short Tesla.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence",
