{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "One of the things that amazes me currently in this market is that, it feels like we are trying to justify every new coming hot tech/growth company as if they are the next AMZN in their field. I think one of the delusions people are having lately is that they look at what people projected for AMZN 5-10-15 years ago and compare that to what actually happened.\n\nWhile it is true that AMZN exceeded any sort of expectation by a huge margin (and did this consistently, year over year) it feels to me that we are taking perhaps one of the most unique success stories ever and then extrapolate that to others, thinking that as if those sort of growth and expectations are in fact more common and easy to achieve than not.\n\nI could discuss this for a number of stocks, I wanted to open discussion for TSLA. As we all know, TSLA stock went up almost 8 fold in the last year. Today, it is common occurrence in the market that analysts are justifying these price levels and state why TSLA is just more than a car company. This argument obviously has its own merits, but aren't we little ahead ourselves and already attribute *from today,* all those things that could potentially be achieved and bake it into the price?\n\nIf we went back in in time, we could probably say AMZN was more than just a book company, but could we really say that they would have almost monopolistic power in most of the areas they operated in? Could we really say back in 2008 that AMZN would emerge the market leader in something like for instance Cloud? Or, did these things happen and then we realized how great AMZN became, *after the fact.* It feels like this was much easier to do in hindsight. But what if AMZN is truly that one outlier, anomaly, in the history of stock markets in terms of sustained growth and market power?\n\nIsn't this what we are trying to do with TSLA here? I do think Elon is one of the greatest minds of our time and can achieve far beyond any other has achieved so I am not comparing Bezos or any other with Elon here. But what I am trying to say is that, just thinking TSLA as a company, aren't we already saying today that they already have monopolistic power in EV cars, autonomous driving, solar-energy trade, underground tunnels, robotaxis, etc. - you name it,  as if they are already there and waiting to be switched on? It's as if we have already attributed everything we could imagine could happen and already announced TSLA as the winner.\n\nNow this is the theory side of things. **How about financial side of things?**\n\nI don't want to approach this from a car sales point of view, but I will make certain comments.\n\nBut what if we applied AMZN's growth trajectory into TSLA, without focusing too much on car sales, and just see what growth and valuation would lead us? If TSLA is just more than a car company, what other example could serve best in terms of growth, thinking from an array of products and technological advantage perspective?\n\nSo I did a quick and dirty DCF calculation. In there, my starting point is the first year when AMZN hit $24 billion in revenue, which is 2009. TSLA achieved it's $24 billion in 2019, so from there onwards I am applying AMZN's growth trajectory in the next 10-11 years. Then, growth is gradually reduced in going into the terminal year. What this means is TSLA will be roughly $900 billion revenue generating company by year 20 (2040). From a car sales perspective, I can't really project how many cars it could sell in 20 years,  but lets say it is 10 million cars. (I think GS said 15 million). Toyota in 2019 sold around this number I believe so with all the competition that will happen in this space, I think this is no under estimation. In 2019, TSLA sold roughly 367,500 cars and for a total revenue of $19.2 billion (excluding regulatory credits). On average this equates to $52k per car. In 20 years, car prices will be higher than what they are today obviously, but there will be competition and economies of scale to bring the price down. This one is hard to assume but let's say it grows 1.0% - 1.5% per year, again not necessarily higher because of these offsetting factors. If they do indeed sell 10 million cars, this is roughly $600-650 billion from cars.\n\nThis leaves you with another $200-250 billion or so for other things, whatever you want to attribute this for - AI, robotaxies, insurance, whatever. Now this figure is a future value, so from today's perspective (using a discount rate of 8% used in my DCF below) that's roughly $60 billion. This is again a huge number, as it is almost another Facebook, 2x Coca-Cola etc., or half of GM/Toyota type business from a revenue perspective, again, from *today's perspective - none of which has already happened.*\n\n**Once again I want to point out that my revenue projections are not driven by bottoms-up car sales, rather, I am using simply AMZN trajectory in terms of growth, then try to attribute the resulting final revenue figure into parts, obviously majority being from car sales, and the rest from whatever you can think of. (Simply because we don't know what AI/Robos/Insurance/Transportation businesses can generate from revenue/profitability/market share perspective and more importantly what the competition in those areas can be)**\n\nSo in the stock price we have baked in, from a revenue perspective, a car business that will sell at least 10 million cars (this number can obviously be higher but even 10 million will be big market share), keep inflation adjusted car prices same (which I think will go down substantially even with inflation), and other businesses that are worth, today, more than most companies you can think of.\n\nNow this is the growth side of things. How about margins?\n\nWe know TSLA generated a last twelve months EBITDA margin of 14% as of Q3 2020. While margins from car manufacturing is certainly improving, most of this margin is actually attributed to sales of regulatory credits, which are by definition almost 100% profit. And so in reality, the margins are much lower, maybe around low single digits between 1-5%. Now this is important because even with all this revenue growth (and if you disagree with me and think it will even be higher), you still need to achieve big margins on your business. I mean really really good margins, we are talking about 15-25% each year. Interestingly, AMZN, while growing its top line crazily over the years and becoming a behemoth as it is today, always lacked in terms of their margins. That goes without saying they are a tech company that typically exhibit great returns on capital. So the point is they had to sacrifice their margins to be able to achieve this growth and this is an important point.\n\nIn my DCF, I am extremely generous. I kept TSLA's EBITDA margins at 15% for the next 3 years, bumped to 17.5%, 20.0%, then to finally 25.0% every 3 years in going forward. Once again these regulatory credits will not be there forever so those margins are extremely optimistic at this point. They might indeed achieve 25% margins in 10 years or so but it won't be this smooth.\n\nWith these two major factors, other items in the DCF are not super important. The discount rate is 8.0%, which I believe is reasonable, NWC and Capex assumptions are in line with what they are today and I don't think they would necessarily go down (if not go up).  I just want to mention that you may completely disagree with some of the assumptions I outlined above. The point however is no matter what sort of DCF you come up with, you will end up either with lower or slight higher value for TSLA, using very, very aggressive assumptions for 10+ years. So the point and question is around the **margin of safety** here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p86f1jbm86661.jpg?width=1690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14679af1deedc9e3e04fdd564ccc006a862acc8a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou might wonder, well your price is even higher than what it is today so why did you write this.\n\nOnce again my whole point in the argument was that the margin of error in TSLA's stock price right now is non-existent, because we've already treated it the next AMZN, gave the best margins possible, attributed big bucks on its other stuff. I think my DCF is still in the unreasonable side, but I wanted to point this out that even a s*light change in trajectory would mean a totally different path and stock price for TSLA.*\n\nSo the question is, are we ahead of ourselves with TSLA? This could also apply to others as well, this so called growth companies. It is as if we are pricing everything today and think that they have already achieved incredible market share in everything they touched and it's only a matter of time that these revenue/profits are realized. Are we taking one anomaly and applying this rationale for every other great company under the name of \"it's tech\"? Elon is great and TSLA will be great. But the business model may not just allow them to be the next AMZN, regardless of technology or improvement.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "author_fullname": "t2_qrk56", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Pricing everything as if they are the next AMZN (TSLA story)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Discussion"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 52, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"p86f1jbm86661": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 40, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p86f1jbm86661.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ec6ca76dbde95bb5ffbfa43d3565354ad52ecf54"}, {"y": 80, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p86f1jbm86661.jpg?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=127110026909b18667ff29c91fc2a8641852ef08"}, {"y": 118, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p86f1jbm86661.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=bdb8e73a276ae2ba3cd18efc4aa1992f94a03b66"}, {"y": 237, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p86f1jbm86661.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9e7b2da5b5900adc6835fa2c0de03adf57625bd5"}, {"y": 356, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p86f1jbm86661.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5ea03cc3581b3aa1996f4ecf6ab546886cdd70f9"}, {"y": 401, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p86f1jbm86661.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=122f94e1a93c05982583275b05e3317dc6f8a061"}], "s": {"y": 628, "x": 1690, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p86f1jbm86661.jpg?width=1690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14679af1deedc9e3e04fdd564ccc006a862acc8a"}, "id": "p86f1jbm86661"}}, "name": "t3_kgb3zl", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 24, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/2mx_w_w-LH6fjX8kcctzb71s1GYgqZwU91QTa0_KGk4.jpg", "edited": 1608405094.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\u001b201118:3:1"}], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1608424952.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>One of the things that amazes me currently in this market is that, it feels like we are trying to justify every new coming hot tech/growth company as if they are the next AMZN in their field.

It just so happens TSLA has rewarded us a lot of the time. Many companies do not reward.\n\nIt reminds me when Tom Leighton's company Akamai went public in the late 90s.
