World things FireEye sucks because ONLY THEY were breached... so they thought, until 12/13 came around. FireEye literally did not give a \\*\\*\\*\\* and continued with their investigations. FireEye is at the forefront of investigating a WORLD-WIDE impacting supply-chain breach. FireEye tracks down the source of the breach to Solarwinds (and doesn't throw any shade AT ALL while doing it). They coin the exploit/threat being called \"SunBurst\". With this being said, it was recently announced that C-Level at Solarwinds knew about this breach a day or two before even they themselves announced it (a few higher ups sold millions in stock). So let's take a sec to compare here before moving on:\n\n\\- FireEye: Announces they identified a breach as soon as possible to them finding out. They then, again ASAP, announce that red team tools were potentially stolen and IMMEDIATELLY publish a github repository to assist the world. They then identify the breach came from a company (Solarwinds) before the company has the balls to announce it (leaving time for selling their own stonks first of course). FireEye has a chance to blatantly say \"Hey it wasn't our fault it's cause this other company got popped\". But they don't, instead they take the angle of providing as much information as possible for ALL organizations to use to help determine if they themselves have been impacted.\n\n\\- SolarWinds: Finds out they were breaches, takes time to sell stocks, then announces the breach a day later. Oh ALSO, I have been threat hunting for Sunburst IoCs (indicators of compromise) in over 90+ unique environments/companies and we are using FireEye's report to base our investigations off of, as is the majority of the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point, stocks don't really rise too much because plebs like all of you don't realize that FireEye is now the focal point of detection, mitigation, and ongoing defense in this recovery from a Nation-state attack. CISOs at almost EVERY company that uses SolarWinds (most companies use solarwinds) are making poopies in their $3,000 kakis and are turning to FireEye reports for guidance. FireEye is also releasing detection and response capabilities to their current customer base IMMEDIATELY (I saw this in real time across several companies). This is leading companies that don't use FireEye as a service provider to say \"Hey, that would be nice to have they are really good\" just in time for next year's budgets to be announced, what do you think companies are going to buy??? FireEye and other Cyber security tools, duh you apes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Tensions are high, companies are squirming to determine if they are impacted, and FireEye is there to give guidance, FOR FREE< FOR THE SAKE OF THE CYBER WORLD, every step of the way. You stinky boys start to realize and BOOM! Their shares go from $13.60 to $18.21, nearly a 30% increase. Other actually useful cyber security tool and service providers see increases as well. Crowdstrike is one to highlight. Crowdstrike pushed out a Sunburst dashboard to all their customers allowing for searches to be conducted on key IoCs dating back to March almost INSTANTLY. Stocks FLY UP and a lot of people aren't even aware that things like that are being pushed live by specific companies like Crowdstrike.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me summarize this for the illiterate drop outs that skip right to the bottom, Good Cyber security companies that RESPOND at the call of action and enable their customers to stay protected and help with identifying if they are impacted, are the ones that will BOOM the entire next year. Companies are getting their budgets determined for the next fiscal year and reputable companies like some I will list below WILL be getting more customers for the LONG HAUL. The list I am providing is not based of book knowledge, it is not based off of random research from other people that used the tool like twice, it is based of my personal use of every single one of these tools, and using them in more than one environment DAILY for the last 6-years as well as responding to 3-4 major breaches just this year with these tools. If you want \"TENDIES TO THE MOON\" as you turkeys say, invest in these as they have nowhere to go but UP...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFireEye (FEYE): Has always been and will continue to be a company that is a cumulation of industry and world leading technical knowledge. They will ALWAYS be at the forefront and after their actions and response to one of the biggest breaches we have seen in years... will 100% grow in reputation and customer base.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCrowdstrike(CRWD): First to address the \"Never buy green\" mentality... IDGAF how steady they are increasing right now, it will continue due to the Elite level service and tools they provide. Out of every Endpoint Detection and Response tool I have used, which is all of them, Crowdstrike is the BEST. Carbon black (VMWare), Cylance, Palo Cortex, and others can all suck a cyber fart for now. Crowdstrike is almost INSTANT when something new comes up in the industry. They notify their customers of threats ASAP and even create/deploy dashboards and capabilities for almost every raesponse. The ppl at CRWD dont sleep, and neither should you.... get this stonk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPalo Alto (PANW): I know when I was complementing Crowdstrike I threw shade at Palo's Cortex XDR tool... BUT Palo is the most feature driven, verbose, and intuitive cyber tool provided when focusing on mainstream firewall providers. The thing is... they always evolve, they don't just do firewalls, they are at the forefront of the new Cyber buzz word \"XDR\" (XDR is cross-layered detection and response. XDR collects and automatically correlates data across multiple security layers). Their services and tools are widely used, consistently improving, and always evolving. Palo is EXTREMELY sticky with customer retention. They integrate so closely with a network that moving away from their tools costs more money than it's worth. EXPECT PEOPLE TO THROW WADS OF CORPERATE CASH AT THIS NEW XDR SERVICE ALSO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have more but my top 3 are above.

There are steadily crawling back up in stock value over the past week (Up \\~7%). Splunk is BY FAR the BEST SIEM ( Security information and event management) that is currently available. I have access to every single SIEM and Splunk is the ONLY one that gets me excited because it is more advanced and capable than the rest. They may not be profitable now but once they get over a couple humps soon they will be profitable.
