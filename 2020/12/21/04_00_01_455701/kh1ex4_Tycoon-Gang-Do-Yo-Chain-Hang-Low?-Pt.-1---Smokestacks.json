{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Whaddup cock womblers, its ya boy, Chingy, back once again to inquire about about the length of yo chain and its mineral composition. I'm a proud member of the WSB weekend squad -- we're like the Tuesday afternoon squad at a strip club, so don't expect to get a lap dance from Carmen Electra circa 2003. I don't even know how to show you my crayon collection. But I don't usually have time to write DD's while I'm flipping burgers at Wendy's 9-5, so this is what you get.\n\nMy last post caused me to get DMed some smart questions, and some not-so-smart questions. So, because it's cold af outside and I can't stand any weather that's too cold for flip flops, I stayed my ass in my fortress of solitude, surrounded by my jizz rags, the whole damn weekend thinking about this play. If you're illiterate or need TL;DRs and rocket emojis, then pass by. If you're looking to play weeklies and other FDs, then pass by. I do have some moonshot plays I'm doing as well, and if ya'll yodel on my chode enough, I might tell you about them, but no, this DD is for 1/3 of the centerpiece of my 2021 play. That's right, I actually try and plan moves a year out and then measure the results over weeks rather than fucking minutes, you fucking head-trauma goldfish.\n\nBasically, my play breaks down into 3 segments: Smokestacks, Ships, and Mines. I'll break down my DD on smokestacks with some of my top picks here. If ya'll want, I'll do Part 2 and 3 for Ships and Mines, but shit would be too long if I did it all at the same time, and I know many of you are already glossy eyed over this wall of text.  My last post was directed at MT gang, because they were seeing what I am seeing but let's have a quick re-cap to the current situation, the past, and the future so that you can understand the macroeconomic context of this play.\n\n**The Prologue**\n\nLet's start in 2018. We could go back further, and for some of the stocks in Part 2 and 3, we will, but 2018 is a good place to start. What happened in 2018? Well, something pretty major, something pretty fucking epically stupid which will likely be corrected in the near term and bring us tendies in the long-term. Metals began a pretty gnarly slump in early 2018, and that slump drug a lot of things down; the whole materials sector flopped, dry goods shippers and bulkers flopped, mines flopped. It was shit show. Why? Trump put his retarded ass tariffs in place. They didn't do shit except cause the market to go down faster than a Kentucky truck stop whore. Even if you look at US Steel, it spiked after the announcement, then sank with the rest of the market. Why? Because increased costs tanked demand. This is proof that just because someone knows how to get slack-jawed cousin fuckers to part with their money for some magical red hats, that they don't know fuck all about economics. Now, what you may not know is that those tariffs applied to things besides steel too, basically all the metals, and we're going to be picking up on all of that. Love it or hate it, Biden is an old-school free-trade neo-liberal, and he's going to get rid of that dumbass tariff, and that means more money moving in the market, which means more tendies for us. In removing the tariff, other countries will likely also remove their tariffs on American materials, so everyone wins and can have a big old globalist circle jerk about it, but my money is on the European and South American materials makers.\n\nIn fact, I only have two American steel stocks in my play because Trump's retard tariff caused more harm to American industry than to global industry. How? The rest of the world kept trading with each other and we got locked out, so in a recovery play, I'm looking at companies that have fewer barriers to global market, existing global orders, and companies who don't have to start from scratch in re-joining the global recovery, which excludes most American companies because holy fuck did Trump screw the pooch and provide a lovely gift to everyone who isn't American. Removing the tariffs is also going to cause pain to American steel because their safety blanket get pulled away - a problem foreign metal won't have. Yes, yes, American steel like X and CFL will do alright too long-term, but they have more headwinds getting back into the global market that the tariffs made them uncompetitive in. Another consequence of the tariffs is that they didn't actually touch raw iron ore, whose prices remained fairly high, thus pushing the cost of of American steel comparatively higher, giving a double whammy to the cost of American steel compared to others who were moving downwards faster, thus shifting demand to countries that didn't have tariffs.\n\n**The Play (well...one third of it)**\n\nSo let's have a look at who is in my play. I call this the \"Smokestacks\" segment, this is where the raw ore gets turned into something useful. I'll give you the ticker symbol, my positions, and a quick reason why I like it besides the other reasons I mention in this post. So even if you think the tariffs will stay, there's other good reasons to look at these.\n\n**MT ( July 24c & shares)**. *Weekly moving average has been on a steep climb since end of October. Lots of room to recover. 3 recent price increases on its products. It's a meme.*\n\n**AA (July 23c & shares)**  *Weekly moving average has been on a steep climb since end of October. Lots of room to recover. Curtailment of mass layoffs. Aluminum prices also on rebound. Actually engaging in some sustainability efforts, which may get favorable treatment from eco-conscious buyers.

TSLA cybertruck steel supplier*\n\n**T K A M Y (Shares)** *Weekly moving average has been on a steep climb since end of October. Lots of room to recover. Exposure to maritime market will allow it to catch the wave as cruise ships return to service and shippers upgrade and repair their fleets. Look for lots of drydock repairs in Q4 2021 to continue to lift the value*\n\n**A N I O Y (Shares)**. *I don't really have a reason to include this one besides the basic reasons of this DD, but everything else is pretty slow and steady, so I thought I should include one roulette/heart-attack stock.*\n\n**CMC (June 20c & shares)** *I wouldn't buy into this at the moment of publication of this DD, wait for it to dip and for that weekly moving average to get back above the market price. I think it's got another 10%-15% of growth in it and it wouldn't be as hard hit by tariff removal due to presence in other markets (it's the only other American company on my list for that reason, but there's a reason I'm generally bearish on American steel) Tariff removal is going to be good for metals, but not necessarily American ones, at least in the short-term, but I think this one will weather it a bit better.*\n\n**TX (May 30c & shares)**. *Just look at that weekly moving average. Still has about 33% room for recovery. Integrating AI into production management.*\n\n**SID (June 4c & shares).** *This one actually was a rocket, and I expect growth to slow a bit short term, but ITM calls are still cheap, although I'd wait for a pullback. But it's doing well, considering doing a separate IPO for their mining unit, which, by the way, is another reason I like this one, it straddles both the smokestacks and mining Segment. Ore prices have remained high despite metals slump, so since they are in both ore and metals, I like them for growth beyond recovery.*\n\n**G M B X F (Shares)**. *I am hesitant to include this in the smokestacks segment rather than the mines segment, but they're pretty well vertically integrated, so I'll include them in both. Copper market is an undervalued play as well, and these guys are one of the big dicks in that arena. I'll expand my thoughts on this one and other miners like VALE, SCCO, and RIO in Part 3.*\n\n**Breaking it Down, Pepe Silvia Style**\n\nSo let's look at these real quick. I've got positions in all of them, but maybe you don't want go as deep on the chain as I have, so do your own DD and figure out which you like. Most of these are non-American (STLD and CMC being the exceptions). As I mentioned above, I'm more bullish on foreign metals because the removal of the tariffs is going to have a bigger, positive impact on them, while removing the tariffs will initially have a negative impact on American steel. I'm also more bullish on foreign metals because they've been able to continue to trade in each others markets and thus have less catching-up to do in the recovery. Why did I include STLD and CMC? I like STLD because they seem to be in a growth phase right now, I'm looking for an expansion in Texas to potentially break ground in 2021, and I like CMC because they have more foreign exposure than many of their US competitors (they're a member of EuroFER, for example, X is the only other US member of that, and it's just a small Polish subsidiary).\n\nBefore getting into when you can expect tendies, let's revisit the current situation and look towards the future to understand why I'm bullish on metals at all, and foreign ones in particular.  As mentioned, we all now know that the Tantrump Tariff was a shit show that brought the market down by artificially spiking prices (2018) and that depressed demand (2018 & 2019), which ultimately drove down the prices to the shithole they've been in. Then, the pandemic hit and really hammered on it. But, the demand never really went away, it just went into hibernation. 2018-2019 saw major slow downs in domestic industrial growth; fewer and smaller expansions and some pretty large ones that were canceled outright. From my professional experience (I'm an economic developer for the G men), I can tell you that 2018 was the worst year we had. I usually shuffle 3-4 projects across my desk a month, we had 3 the entire year of 2018. Shit was grim. I even visited Europe to go talk to the companies and ask them why they were pulling out, \"we'll call you in 2 years\" is what they said. And guess what cock goblins!? They have! All the companies I was courting had the need and desire to expand, but backed off because of what was going on in the market, their ROI would've been too low to cover the debt of their expansions because the cost for those expansions had magically gone up overnight thanks to the fart bubble muncher in the White House. So you may be wondering, \"but if steel prices are going up again, why are industrials pulling the trigger on expansions now?\" Good question, retard! Part of the answer is that they've been sitting on cash for 2 years that they otherwise would've invested in growth, part of the answer is that steel prices are now naturally rising (due to the scaling back of production capacity since 2018) and thus unlikely to be waited out, and they are still lower than before the whole tariff fiasco started, and removing the tariff would keep some downward pressure on prices while juicing demand. Basically, when the price of metals artificially spiked due to the tariffs, it made sense to try and wait them out, but to those who were mining and making the metals, it meant they suddenly had a big drop in anticipated demand, and so they had to scale back,  but keep their prices up. But like I said, the demand didn't die, it just wanted to wait for a better time. Now we're in an interesting situation; prices are rising naturally due to that pent-up demand and deferred growth wanting to come out, the scale back in production capacity has created a premium on what can be produced, and future economic conditions are better for it, especially since Biden is more likely to re-engage in free-trade than whatever retarded-ass protectionist nonsense the village idiot of Mar-a-Lago was doing to gin up the mouth-breathers. But the production capacity needs to recover and then keep growing to meet demand, and that's where we get on.\n\n**The Payoff**\n\nSo what does all of that mean for your tendies? Well, it means that the the whole supply chain that has been running a skeleton crew for the past 2 years is about to wake the fuck up. Demand from 2 years ago is re-entering the pipeline, natural growth is starting to show back up, those retard tariffs are probably on their way out. For the life of me, I can't explain how real estate has weathered the pandemic so well, but it has, and that sustained demand is part of what is driving up the cost on structural steel. Shit. Those prices are going up so fast even shippers are scrapping their old ships to get in on it. I'll discuss this more in Part 2 and why it means dry goods shippers and bulkers are gonna be in victory lane as well, but that's for next time. For now, let's stick to how we're going to make money off the smokestacks.\n\nThe first thing to note here, and I'll even bold it, is: ***THIS IS NOT A ROCKET.*** If you're gonna choose an emoji, find a freight train (also in Part 2). Alright? Don't be asking me if January calls are what you should get, because the answer is no unless you're talking about 2022. No, this is a long ass train, loaded with tendies, slowly heading up the green dollar hills towards you. All you gotta do is put money in and wait. If you're looking for FDs and quickly flipping shit, you might get lucky with some of these companies, but for the most part, all you gotta do is wait. Trust me, I know how difficult that can be when you're addicted to refreshing your account between every tug on your dick, but that's what this calls for. That means set your charts to daily or weekly and don't worry about a red day, there will be some of those along the way, maybe even red weeks, especially if some other populist cock gobbler decides to throw a wrench into the global economy or China does something retarded. Don't even worry about it until its warm enough to start breaking out flip flops again. Alright? Steel hands guys, steel hands. This isn't tech where you throw up a couple more servers, hire more people, and suddenly call yourself scaled up. No, it takes a long time for iron to be busted out of a mine, get shipped, be processed, and sold. So this isn't a good candidate for YOLO unless you don't mind watching a YOLO in slow motion. No, this is a tycoon play where you put your money on the train and wait for it to arrive.\n\nPersonally? I think end of Q2 and Q3 is where you'll see today's market catalysts show up as earnings, my earliest position is for May, and even that makes me a little nervous for how soon it really is, but I think that's when the feasting might start showing up in reports and I see it going well into 2022.\n\n**TL;DR** We gonna make money like a freight train; slow, steady, and loaded with more tendies than any rocket can carry. If you wanna hop on the freight train like some fucking hobo, then join Tycoon Gang. If you want to see my DD for Ships/Trains, Mines, and maybe even one for industrial services/suppliers, just call me autistic, not retarded.

That means set your charts to daily or weekly and don&#39;t worry about a red day, there will be some of those along the way, maybe even red weeks, especially if some other populist cock gobbler decides to throw a wrench into the global economy or China does something retarded. Don&#39;t even worry about it until its warm enough to start breaking out flip flops again. Alright? Steel hands guys, steel hands. This isn&#39;t tech where you throw up a couple more servers, hire more people, and suddenly call yourself scaled up. No, it takes a long time for iron to be busted out of a mine, get shipped, be processed, and sold. So this isn&#39;t a good candidate for YOLO unless you don&#39;t mind watching a YOLO in slow motion. No, this is a tycoon play where you put your money on the train and wait for it to arrive.</p>\n\n<p>Personally? I think end of Q2 and Q3 is where you&#39;ll see today&#39;s market catalysts show up as earnings, my earliest position is for May, and even that makes me a little nervous for how soon it really is, but I think that&#39;s when the feasting might start showing up in reports and I see it going well into 2022.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> We gonna make money like a freight train; slow, steady, and loaded with more tendies than any rocket can carry. If you wanna hop on the freight train like some fucking hobo, then join Tycoon Gang. If you want to see my DD for Ships/Trains, Mines, and maybe even one for industrial services/suppliers, just call me autistic, not retarded. Also, if you think I&#39;ve missed any good smokestack plays, drop them below.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null,
