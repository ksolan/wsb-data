{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": " \n\n* **Wtf is SGMO?** It\u2019s the most drastically undervalued gene therapy company on the market. They edit genes with zinc finger nucleases, a technology distinctly different from crispr.\n* **Zinc Finger?** It\u2019s theoretically better than crispr. More specificity and less off-target edits than crispr, but years of reading investor village posts and the occasional research paper aren\u2019t easily summarized. And how it works doesn\u2019t really change the thesis here.\n* **Why is it undervalued?** Check out the market cap and past year\u2019s price action of the competitors in the field\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Ticker|Market Cap|\n|:-|:-|\n|BMRN|16 B|\n|CRSP|10.5 B|\n|ONCE|Acquired for 4 B|\n|EDIT|4 B|\n|NTLA|3 B|\n|SGMO|2 B|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Why is BMRN on there?** Because Biomarin is SGMO\u2019s largest competitor for Hemophilia A gene therapy, which also happens to SGMO\u2019s closest to market product. But, surprise, SGMO has better data than BMRN! This year they reported higher sustained clotting factor levels and no bleeds within the first 52 weeks for the highest dose level of SB-525. Biomarin\u2019s patients are having bleeds and requiring factor, and because of it (and the much better data from SGMO) BMRN got a rejection from the FDA when they tried to get accelerated approval to beat SGMO to market: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-biomarin-pharma-fda/u-s-fda-rejects-biomarin-hemophilia-a-gene-therapy-shares-dive-idUSKCN25F1H6](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-biomarin-pharma-fda/u-s-fda-rejects-biomarin-hemophilia-a-gene-therapy-shares-dive-idUSKCN25F1H6) BTW, the SGMO Hemophilia A gene therapy program is also partnered with \\*Pfizer\\*\n* **Partnered with Pfizer?** **Yeah, and Takeda. And Kite therapeutics. And Novartis. And Sanofi. And Biogen.** I\u2019m retarded, but highly doubt those 5 big pharma partners and their entire team of scientists and capital allocation programs are as retarded as me. Look at the pipeline page: [https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline](https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline) And just for good measure, the Biogen/SGMO collaboration also included Biogen acquiring so much SGMO stock that Biogen owns like 17% of the damn company!!!! Acquisition rumors abound\u2026and if you look at the table above most of those other names don't have anywhere near the number of partnerships/pipeline programs SGMO has.\n* **Biogen partnership is for multiple neurological diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s, the single largest unmet need in medicine today.** And Biogen didn\u2019t fuck around with crispr for it.\n* **Speaking of pipeline, I hope you clicked on the link to the pipeline page.** Aside from the Phase 3 trial with Pfizer, they have four Phase 1 or 2 trials, and 13 disclosed preclinical trials. And 7 wholly-owned (not partnered) programs. And an estimated 600-700 million cash runway, with the expenses for the phase 3 program with Pfizer covered by Pfizer, and a potential reimbursement of a few hundred thousand to $1 million plus per patient (still cheaper than replacement factor infusion therapy).\n* **Why isn\u2019t this worth more?** I dunno, but I can guess. CRSPR was featured on Radiolab and had some articles written about it a few years ago, and has had enough press that most people have heard of it in passing. SGMO also had some false starts, once a long time ago when they were basically a different company trying to tackle some bullshit like diabetic neuropathy. Another time when they were trying to do gene editing in live patients for MPS II (the CHAMPIONS \u00bd trial) that didn\u2019t have great results. Yes, they are trying to edit genes in live humans. Turns out it\u2019s hard. And yes, it worked via detection of targeted integration via liver biopsy, but had not edit enough cells to be clinically significant (they\u2019re still working on it).\n* **What else are they working on?** T-cell therapies, which can address anything from transplant rejection (their wholly-owned TX200 trial) to autoimmune diseases (IBD, also wholly owned). They bought the company TX Cell for 84 million in 2018 for this purpose.\n* **So why the hell are you telling me about this now?** Last couple weeks have been weird and SGMO has been taking off. Look at the last year specifically this month- it fucking rocketed off, pulled back, and has started to climb again. Price action on this stock has always been super wonky. If you follow it as close as I do, you\u2019d notice the huge price spike happened \\*after\\* they reported the positive Hemophilia A data at ASH Dec 7th- the price spiked Dec 10th.\n* **Anything else going to make the price rocket up?** Aside from the fact that every gene therapy company chart has been a goddamn hockey stick this year, here\u2019s some events: [https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=152550&pt=msg&mid=21430904](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=152550&pt=msg&mid=21430904)\n* **Also, its not in the ARKG gene therapy fund yet**, but theres a good chance Cathie Wood might shift profits from other names to SGMO #1 to diversify and #2 because it\u2019s comparatively cheap as shit.\n* **Speaking of price, HCW just gave it a $25 price target.** Truist gave it price target $23. Some badass analyst with huge nuts had it at $36. The average is like $21. Mine personally is $25 this year and $45 long term. Here\u2019s some undiagnosed autist on IV making a case: [https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=152920&pt=msg&mid=21447148](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=152920&pt=msg&mid=21447148)\n* **Yeah but do you own any, you kooky fuck with a wizard avatar?** Yeah, I have 2500+ shares, 25+ ITM calls, and 40+ OTM calls across all my accounts. I attached a screenshot from my traditional IRA. It\u2019s most of my tradeable retirement. Not sure if this counts as YOLO? I feel like I\u2019m wearing a life helmet at this point having held and accumulated this shit for 3+ years and finally seeing it take off.\n* **Thesis summary; SGMO is undervalued.** They have superior gene editing technology and a shit ton of shots on target in their huge pipeline with 5 big pharma partners, and they are getting close to hemophilia A gene therapy being commercialized in early 2022. Even if they completely fuck up more than half their pipeline they\u2019re still undervalued.\n* **TLDR; why to invest in SGMO:** [https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline](https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline)\n* **TLDR; Buy SGMO now.**      LEAPs > short term, this stock trades weird and I don\u2019t know how soon      it will rocket off, but started to launch a couple weeks ago. **Shares      are still cheap.** Don\u2019t buy calls too far OTM in case of buyout. **May      and August calls in the $17-$20 range seem cheap. Jan\u201922 $20 strike looks      good to me, or Jan\u201923 $25 strike. $20 conservative price target by      year-end 2021. Long term price target $45.** \n* *Note: the original post got banned because I updated it and used a four-letter word that was a banned ticker.
