At this point since VMware was not a victim, but instead a utility, they may find themselves following the downward path of SolarWinds as the reputation of their Identity Management products takes a beating. 5.6% may be the beginning of a weeks long drop as customers reassess their ties to VMware identity management products and investors panic on the correlation to the SolarWinds hack.\n\n**What is VMware?**\n\nVMware provides the worlds premier virtualization software. \"VMware, Inc. engages in the provision of cloud infrastructure and business mobility.
