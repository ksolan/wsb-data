RIG has been through severe financial trouble. RIG doesn&#39;t hold value well (hence it&#39;s trading it freaking weeklies) no matter what it&#39;s IV is and very simply has very little realistic long-term value. It is trading as an &quot;undervalued&quot; company however it also doesn&#39;t have much value inherent to it and the oil escapades that plagued the larger corporations ravaged the already not very efficient RIG far worse. </p>\n\n<p>As oil recovers RIG won&#39;t be a major player much like how it was not in the past.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh5hl4/simple_rig_dd_inside/ggjczyi/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_ggjczyi", "created": 1608540260.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "replies": []}]}]}, {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_kh5hl4", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ggj9bh3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": {"name": "Autumus_Prime", "fullname": "t2_3iho29fc"}, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_kh5hl4", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_3iho29fc", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "body": "I bought shares below $1 on a whim and sold $2c back in October or november and made some 150%.
