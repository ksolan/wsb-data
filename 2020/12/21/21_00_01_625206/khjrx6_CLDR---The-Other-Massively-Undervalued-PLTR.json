{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Long time lurker and I\u2019m finally deciding it's time to show you retards the biggest missed opportunity of any IPO in the past 5 years. \n\nI know that PLTR is going to the moon, and these past couple weeks have been super frustrating as it seems to currently be refueling for a run up. But while you wait for your pockets to return to tendie town, might be worth checking out a company that does basically **\\*the exact same thing\\*** that is currently valued at 10x less than PLTR. \n\nFull disclosure - I used to work at Cloudera and was there when they IPO\u2019d in 2017 - the same day as CVNA. At the time, Cloudera was one of the biggest unicorns in Silicon Valley as they had billions in funding from some pretty notable VCs and a hefty amount from Intel.  After a super disappointing IPO, I sold off every share I owned over the next year as companies like Carvana soared. At the time I was convinced that nobody would ever understand the complicated software that Cloudera built and sold, and despite solid growth, lots of enterprise customers, and a road to profitability, it just kind of\u2026 fell flat.  \n\nThat is, until WSB took over the world. Fast forward to 2020 and a PLTR IPO that grew massively over the next several months - I was completely shocked. Yes, I know you\u2019re all retarded but I didn\u2019t know you were \\*that\\* retarded that you would give PLTR, a company founded 5 years before CLDR with only 20% higher revenue and lower margins, a 10x higher valuation (\\~$50 billion market cap for PLTR vs \\~$4 billion for CLDR). I have former colleagues that worked with me at CLDR and who now work at PLTR and they think it\u2019s complete insanity that PLTR has a valuation that much higher than CLDR. If you all fundamentally believe that PLTR is worth more than $40 billion, then you are missing a huge opportunity with CLDR. \n\nCloudera and Palantir use basically the same exact underlying software components to build fundamentally the same exact solutions for their customers. Don't believe me? Go look at the [CLDR](https://github.com/cloudera) and [PLTR](https://github.com/palantir?page=1) Github repos and look for terms like \"hadoop\", \"spark\", \"parquet\", etc. Yes, there are some differences in their product but they are more the same than they are different - at the end of the day the biggest thing each of these companies do is data integration and analytics. However, their approaches, technology influence, and sales methodology should yield a similar or better valuation for CLDR than PLTR for a number of reasons:\n\n* Though PLTR has higher quarterly revenues, CLDR has much better [gross profit margins](https://ycharts.com/companies/CLDR/gross_profit_margin) (81% most recently and increasing vs 63% for PLTR), likely due to their revenue mix being more heavily weighted in software subscriptions vs services. For the latest quarter, [CLDR had 91% of revenue from subscription software sales](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001535379/ec48b119-7c21-4fa4-a3fa-2e3bf020c6fb.pdf) and 8% from services, while PLTR doesn\u2019t seem to break this out in their 10-Q. CLDR subscription software margins are 87% as of last quarter. [PLTR has a 3.5x higher cost of revenue](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/8a404f13-53a8-4610-9f9a-34add0ec1742.pdf) which all but confirms that their mix is much more heavily weighted towards services with 10-20% margin vs subscription software that has 80%+ margin.  \n* CLDR reported an EPS of  .15 for the [most recent quarter](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CLDR/analysis?p=CLDR), which was a beat of almost 67%. While PLTR reported an EPS of .09 for the most recent quarter, GAAP net loss is much worse (PLTR earnings were -$853M for last quarter and -$110M for the prior quarter, vs CLDR at -$14M and -$36M, respectively). Accounting for the effect on earnings of their recent IPO, PLTR is probably at least 3x less profitable than CLDR despite having been around for 5 years longer. \n* As another reference point, FSLY is currently trading at a 3x higher market cap than CLDR on negative earnings with a 3x higher net loss and 3x lower revenue. \n* Cloudera has surprised on earnings by at least 50% for each of the last 4 quarters, and should within the next 1 or 2 quarters no longer have a GAAP net loss, and their profitability should continue improving as they continue their pivot to [cloud-based SaaS solutions](https://www.cloudera.com/products/cloudera-data-platform.html). PLTR seems to be years away from achieving the same thing. \n* CLDR has broader sales reach and a larger sales force - they have some government customers (e.g. [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.cloudera.com/about/customers/us-census-bureau.html))  but they [target traditional and high tech enterprises](https://www.cloudera.com/about/customers.html). I never competed even one time against PLTR when I sold CLDR software, which shows that they are much too focused on a particular vertical/industry and/or do not have traction in the broader market. \n* CLDR has greater influence on the underlying technology stack that both PLTR and CLDR use (and AMZN/MSFT/GOOG clouds) because they contribute more code than any other company to the open source community that they all use. They also partner more heavily with big cloud service providers and technology providers (have [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/bigdata/big-data-appliance/5.1/bigli/cdh5.html#GUID-5B5969CD-FE64-46A2-A7BE-53AF6D11AE77)/[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/partners/cloudera) co-sell solutions, CLDR software works in all 3 major cloud providers and they have a SaaS solution that runs in all 3 cloud providers)\n* CLDR has a [more broadly applicable suite of products](https://www.cloudera.com/products.html), as it can fit in the data warehouse/analytics space, the machine learning space, and the data processing space. It competes with other well-known software like traditional data warehouses (Oracle, IBM, Teradata), cloud native warehouses (Snowflake software, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift), and data science and machine learning unicorns like Databricks. Because of this, it has broad applicability vs PLTR who seems to target very specific use cases. \n* Given its cross-cloud compatibility and influence on the open source technology ecosystem, they would be ripe for an acquisition by a traditional enterprise software company who is trying to gain more cloud traction - for example an IBM or an Oracle. I would not be surprised to see them gobbled up in the next year or two. CLDR has a large growth SaaS solution that [grew 40% in the last quarter](https://investors.cloudera.com/news-and-events/news/press-release-details/2020/Cloudera-Reports-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx) that would be a good buy for any of these old guard companies. \n* Both PLTR and CLDR have an 'L' as the second character in the ticker and an 'R' as the fourth character in the ticker which makes them easily interchangeable in any already existing shitposts or memes you've worked on\n* CLDR offers a lot of opportunity for cloud and weather-related puns and usage of cloud emojis, which WSB desperately needs more of.  \n\nFor these reasons and more, I fundamentally believe that CLDR is massively under valued at a $4 billion market cap/$12.68/share and represents a great buying opportunity, especially if you are in the camp that thinks that PLTR should shoot through $30/share, to a $50 billion valuation and to the moon. I mean, SNOW has an absolutely retarded $200 billion market cap. There is no way that CLDR should be valued 10x less than PLTR and 50x less than SNOW.\n\nPositions: GOOG (100 shares, long), SNOW 320c 12/24, CLDR 05/21/21, 20c\n\n**TL;DR** **- If you believe in PLTR,  CLDR makes basically the same products, has a 10x lower market cap, is more profitable, and is worth a serious look as both a solid investment and as a potential acquisition target.
