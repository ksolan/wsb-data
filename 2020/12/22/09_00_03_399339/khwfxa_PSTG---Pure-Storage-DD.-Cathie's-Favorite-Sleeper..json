They started in 2009 developing software for [storage controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_array_controller) using generic [flash storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory) hardware while secretly developing their proprietary software.  They completed this in 2015 and went public, raising $470m in venture capital efforts.  Now they are a leader in Garnet Magic Quadrant for primary storage arrays in 2020.  If you don't know what this means, they're known in the industry as highly efficient, inexpensive and secure data storage.  \n\nSome cool examples of their reputation: F1's top team, Mercedes AMG picked them up and has attributed their success to PSTG's tech.  The City of New Orleans was victim to an extensive cyber attack in 2019 and PSTG saved the day.  PSTG's tech was recently compared to Dell's EMC Powerstore and it wasn't even close.  Pure Storage's FlashArray is the shit.  When the top entities look for data security and management they're not going to settle for the 2nd or 3rd best option, they're going to the best in the industry.\n\nThe run-up for PSTG and many stocks post-election has been the stuff of fairy tales, but I'm not letting that slight me.  Sometimes I will turn away from stocks because I think it's too late, but in reality I'm early.  I bought CRSR at 25 and sold at 35 (F).  Honestly there's no telling how high a company can really run up.  All I know is with a market cap of 6 billion, PSTG has a long way to go.  The 20% run-up over the last month has been on average daily volume.  It looks like institutions have been steadily accumulating ever since Pure Storage established themselves as the best in the industry with the highest potential for growth.  Their numbers make me think that they will be bought out by a larger entity soon, because they're basically operating at a net loss, but with huge potential if they can get their costs down.  **1.36b revenue in 2019.**\n\nKeith Martin, the Senior Director at Cloud Capacity Engineering had this to say about PSTG:\n\n*\u201cPure has had a revolutionary impact on the business, completely changing our mindset and how the cloud infrastructure team functions. The storage experience freed us up to be more creative. It was a magical transformation.\u201d*\n\nLastly I really like the team.  The CEO was a Senior Exec at Cisco Systems.  The CTO was a founding engineer at Veritas, and their Co-Founder served in Yahoo!'s Office of the Chief Technologist.  The company is solid, has a ton of new press / clout and is clearly going places considering cybersecurity is  probably the hottest sector right now.  I am blown away that the volume has been so low so far especially with Cathy scooping up shares all year.  I really love how the chart looks with slow and steady bleed up over the last month.  I expect a huge pop this week.  \n\n**Price target of 27 by EOY.**\n\nPositions:\n\n22.5c 1/15/2021\n\n25c 2/19/2021\n\n30c 1/21/2022\n\n+ Shares.", "author_fullname": "t2_pikcj", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "PSTG - Pure Storage DD.
