What this chart means is that the search term \"Gamestop Playstation\" in Nov 2020 is about 400% larger than it has been since 2012.

You see a spike in 2013 when the last gen consoles were released. Then you see an even bigger spike the year after as people are getting new used games for the consoles they bought the year before. Then a long steady trend down, which makes sense.\n\nNow pay close attention, when did this search term start to plunge way below its trendline, yes right as COVID started.
