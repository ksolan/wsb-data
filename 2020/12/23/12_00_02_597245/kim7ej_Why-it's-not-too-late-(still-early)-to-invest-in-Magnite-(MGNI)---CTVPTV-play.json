You know you don't watch shit cable TV or at least don't want to anymore, right? Well, your favorite apps or shows on Connected TV (AppleTV, FireTV, Hulu, Netflix etc etc) are just beginning to work in advertising spots on their free programming. Magnite is the one who sells alot of those ads for massive clients (exclusive agency for Disney Hulu and Discovery Networks) and they will absolutely add more partners. This is just the beginning. I would say we are 30% of the way into adoption from big brand advertisers (they can also serve small-mid brands).\n\nIn addition, the technology they have processes super targeted ads in real time. This is much better for advertisers than what they got on linear TV. These advertisers have to follow the audience. They have no choice but to spend their money on CTV ads and the younger generations are ditching the cable box completely. This is like investing into the ad agencies that got huge at the inception of the television. BIG MONEY. Lots of room to grow.\n\nMagnite is also working closely with TTD (TradeDesk) to develop identity technology (think cookies) that is less intrusive to the user/consumer and more telling to the advertiser allowing them to target better and with less violation to the consumer's identity. SERIOUS tech. TTD is buying the ads for the big brand advertisers from MGNI who represents the sellers (Disney Hulu etc).\n\nTTD has a $50B market cap. MGNI is sitting right around a $3B cap right now. You see where I am going here. This company will grow and probably quickly since they are leading the sell side (SSP) of the Programmatic TV industry right now.
