{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I saw a post here a few days ago about AST SpaceMobile which caught my interest (link at the bottom), while the xmas slowdown is on I thought I might see if I can find anything that was originally missed - oh boy does it get juicy. I found their institutional investors presentation from last week, sharing some slides as hedge funds don\u2019t get a monopoly on this.\n\nThis might be a long one so TLDR at the bottom, and I\u2019ve split this DD into sections.\n\n# Context\n\nLast week on the 16th, it was announced that AST SpaceMobile were going to be taken public via a SPAC (New Providence Acquisition Corp), for $1.4 Billion, the merger should happen in Q1 next year. They are a company who are building the **first** and **only**, space based, cellular broadband network to be accessible by any standard mobile phone. This considerably expands the reach and reliability of network provider\u2019s mobile broadband coverage. Something traditional companies have tried to do but only with specialised hardware devices \u2013 connecting to smaller less powerful satellites.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/me1kyphghx661.png?width=903&format=png&auto=webp&s=77acf3ce971645898f7bcbaf0bba4883d8361225\n\n# Business Model\n\nIt only gets better from here, they already have signed commercial agreements with huge players such as Vodaphone, AT&T, Telefonica + many more firms who cover emerging markets like Indosat for Indonesia - This sums up to **1.3bn existing subscribers**. AST operate a business-to-business model, if an end user of one of these telecom companies loses coverage, they get notified if they want to use AST\u2019s coverage to reconnect. This will be a surcharge and cost 1-2 USD a month for countries like India and revenue is split 50/50 between AST and the telecom company.\n\nThis offers two major benefits for telecom companies:\n\n\u00b7 Growth from adding extra value to subscribers\n\n\u00b7 Providing a differentiated service so reduces churn between providers\n\nSince it is a low cost, efficient, wholesale model they\u2019re targeting 90%+ EBITDA Margins. Either you're a provider who can offer unlimited coverage or you're not. This will be huge for emerging economies who don't have the infrastructure in place already.\n\n# Valuation\n\nAs I am writing this, it\u2019s trading about $12 which puts the EV/24E EBITDA at 1.7x, compared to comps of 13.3x.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eyxqzoshhx661.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c4e8905382d31e879b8383228671fd834a29f24\n\nTo be trading inline with its comparable companies, the price should be **$51-77** after the merger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aluwqx9tix661.png?width=394&format=png&auto=webp&s=72e91ee36f458ffb2103dbf1a2294047644212d6\n\nEven a very bearish analysis would put the target price at $25-30. So what does this all mean? Well AST is incredibly attractive price right now, and its climbing, the last two days have seen a 20% increase in price as investors start really jumping into the SPAC because of this.\n\n# Investment Thesis\n\nThere is a lot of appetite for this, being first to market with no competitors gives a huge advantage, already having agreements/partnerships in place means that they\u2019re hitting the ground running. Patents and high barriers to entry will restrict direct competitors from being able to compete for a substantial period. The deal will go live in Feb-March next year so lets get rich and get in before it takes off.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nAST SpaceMobile is going public via a SPAC in 1Q 20 (SPAC is trading now). It\u2019s the first and only company to offer space based, cellular broadband that will work with the existing Iphone you\u2019re reading this off now \u2013 no extra hardware or software needed. They already have 1.3bn subscribers via partnered telecom companies and are targeting the 51% of the global population without any coverage. Price is now $12 but should be $50-70 to be inline with comparable comps. Deal announced last week and its getting hot.
