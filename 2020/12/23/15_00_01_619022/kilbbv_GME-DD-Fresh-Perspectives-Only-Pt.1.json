{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**GME Fresh Perspectives Pt.1** (sources at the bottom)\n\nHello Autists,\n\nHere is the Pt1 of daily fresh perspectives I promised. I\u2019m breaking them down to chewable bits (less than 5 min read ea) because I know reading isn\u2019t fun. I\u2019m with you, I don\u2019t enjoy reading either. Give it to me straight if this gets too boring.\n\nThrough this series of DDs, I hope to show you guys perhaps *some* of what Cohen sees.\n\nPlease note that I will be referring to these 2 points in this DD, and maybe even throughout this DD series. These are the most important points that would form the foundation of my DD but they aren't the 'freshest' I apologize.\n\n**1. Let me start by pointing out that most of us WSB autists are privileged. There exists the others, who actually make up the majority of the population** who/whose kids can\u2019t afford to risk losing hundreds if not thousands of dollars making \u201ceducated guesses\u201d/gambling the way we do.\n\nAs a group, it\u2019s easy for us to confirm each other\u2019s biases, forget about the rest and create our own echo chamber.\n\n**2. Digital games is overtaking physical copies. This is true.**\n\nSONY, EA, Take Two all have crossed a tipping point where more than half of their console games are now sold via download 51%, 52% and 55%\n\nFor Sony, it was up from 37% last year. (Source A)\n\nGenerally, the growth of digital vs discs seems to be quite even, so using SONY as an example, that\u2019s a 38% increase (Yes. It\u2019s a 14% difference, but it\u2019s a 38% increase from 37% that takes it to 51%). That means GME\u2019s going to experience apx 26% decrease YOY in sales.\n\n\\*\\*BUT!\\*\\*The global console games market is expected to grow from $40.6 billion in 2019 to about $57.9 billion in 2020 (source B) That\u2019s a 42.6% increase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The numbers,](https://preview.redd.it/wiy7milvwu661.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=795d2a001ba7d25b4e7275f732ba8514d3df0c17)\n\n**Young Mason:** This mean physical copies are dying! GME is DEAD!\n\nNot quite. Actually, not at all. GME will definitely get a smaller percentage of the *console game pie*, but the pie itself has grown and they will actually end up with a larger slice.\n\n**But wait, there\u2019s more!** The research/stats was published in May. Did anyone project COVID will be as bad as it is now? Stay at home kids want to play games, meet desperate WFH parents that want a break. I am confident that the 2 factors push the numbers a lot higher than $57.90 Billion, but hey for now let\u2019s just use that. Also remember, that % for digital games download vs physical is based on quantity including all the shit/old games they push for cheap and people buy out of boredom. Although the numbers aren\u2019t reported solid, the consensus is, is that more disc consoles are sold because people want to play their old disc games. Even at a modest 50/50, we\u2019re locked in more or less until the next console cycle.\n\n\\*\\*But wait, there\u2019s even more!\\*\\*So the console pie has grown 42.6%. You know what else has grown and is growing?\n\nGaming overall! Mobile, PC, even board games, they\u2019ve all been growing. Checkout Gamestop\u2019s website.\n\nThey\u2019ve been getting into phones, computer parts and board games. It\u2019s not out of desperation. It is the right move as Gamestop is really establishing its brand as one stop shop for games. When you think building supplies, you think Home Depot. Soon, when you think games, you will think Gamestop.\n\nGamestop is already set up for used games/devices trading like no one else. Phones are super liquid and high in demand (This isn't anything serious YET, I will cover this in another DD). Did I tell you that the digital consoles are now more tradable/rentable too? No moving parts = very low risk of damage other than drops/spills. Keep an eye on this. Remember the point #1.\n\nCarrying computer parts also shield them from any sort of lockdown possibility because computer parts are essential. Bigger pie, and more pies.\n\n**What you are saying makes sense\u2026 but bro, don\u2019t you remember Q3 earnings?**\n\nYes, I do\u2026Bro. They had a decrease in revenue. Do you remember Q3 was for August, September, October?\n\nWere you really thinking about video games back then? We were all out there seeing friends, partying, enjoying nature thinking either Covid was gone and it was renaissance or thinking second wave is coming, and we have to enjoy it while it lasts.\n\n**Establishing its brand? Are you nuts? People hate GME.**\n\nYes. **We do**. We all have that bitter memory. We remember the day when we or our friend went to GME to literally get hustled as a noob kid like we remember going to the strip club to get hustled as a noob adult.\n\nRemember, we are ALL 18\\~40+, \u2018privileged\u2019 minority. (Point#1).Peak gaming target demographics is around 13\\~25.\n\nRight now, GME is putting trade value of all games online, updated daily and it isn\u2019t as \u2018hustly\u2019 as it used to be. This is a simple change, but powerful. People now know exactly what to expect, and they\u2019d only bring in the games/consoles when they see the money/credit is worth more for them.\n\nResults? Happier transactions on both ends, and better branding moving forward.\n\nThey\u2019ve also been spending a lot more on advertising for brand recognition. That recognition will soon put them in a spot where they are the only one that can organize e-sports/gaming tournaments in the western world in any meaningful way.\n\nI will leave you with this. The majority (Point #1) isn\u2019t so lucky to start blowing money at the launch of a new console. Where can the majority go to fill their increased gaming needs while being fiscally conservative during this pandemic? eBay? With all the shipping delays?\n\nLike how Amazon is eating eBay\u2019s breakfast but eBay will always have its market share in ecommerce, GME will always have its place in gaming at the very least.\n\n**Tomorrow I will tell you why GME will crush Amazon and not the other way around, and also touch up on either what their current valuation means to Cohen, or the future of gaming.**\n\nDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m even going to cover Stadia at one point too.\n\nEdit: Positions:  My position on GME is made up of shares as well as options JAN 15 15C, 30C, APR 16 30C. GME makes majority of my port.\n\nSources A:\n\n[https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ea-sony-and-take-two-now-sell-more-console-games-digitally-than-boxed/](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ea-sony-and-take-two-now-sell-more-console-games-digitally-than-boxed/)\n\nSources B:\n\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/how-the-gaming-industry-may-be-experiencing-rapid-growth-during-the-pandemic-301126092.html#:\\~:text=A%20recent%20report%20from%20ResearchAndMarkets,about%20%2457.9%20billion%20in%202020](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/how-the-gaming-industry-may-be-experiencing-rapid-growth-during-the-pandemic-301126092.html#:~:text=A%20recent%20report%20from%20ResearchAndMarkets,about%20%2457.9%20billion%20in%202020).\n\nSource C:\n\n[https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-game-market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-game-market)", "author_fullname": "t2_7gwj942d", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "GME DD Fresh Perspectives Only Pt.1", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"wiy7milvwu661": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wiy7milvwu661.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=356e405eff307fcaeb851664a31e01d8f067c9c2"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wiy7milvwu661.jpg?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=78592c6551feaa895079f8cede310db4c59c5186"}, {"y": 179, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wiy7milvwu661.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=167b0e50101a678f3a25c1492815c4166857e956"}, {"y": 359, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wiy7milvwu661.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=52ec9d165b178b4f1a75082ec6d70cb0d309c2c3"}], "s": {"y": 413, "x": 735, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wiy7milvwu661.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=795d2a001ba7d25b4e7275f732ba8514d3df0c17"}, "id": "wiy7milvwu661"}}, "name": "t3_kilbbv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 213, "total_awards_received": 2, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 213, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ptg55kubpMDfBgmhHU5PXWW31lCo2W1vQq1bxofbFPw.jpg", "edited": 1608696669.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1608723693.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>GME Fresh Perspectives Pt.1</strong> (sources at the bottom)</p>\n\n<p>Hello Autists,</p>\n\n<p>Here is the Pt1 of daily fresh perspectives I promised.
