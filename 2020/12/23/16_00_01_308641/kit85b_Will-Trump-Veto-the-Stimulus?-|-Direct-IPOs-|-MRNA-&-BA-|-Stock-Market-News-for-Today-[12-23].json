{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**Can and will Trump actually Veto the stimulus bill? The NYSE approved the plan for direct IPOs. Should you sell Moderna & buy Boeing? Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market.**\n\n **\\~Very Long Post\\~** \n\nHello everyone and Good Morning!  So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the tech heavy [Nasdaq](https://ibb.co/ryVyyKt) up more than 0.5% and closing at a new all-time high, while the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/X31XLDq) finished down 0.21% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/qB2m8Jm) lagged behind, finishing the day with a 200 points loss, its biggest loss in December. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Qkw3MBK) trending down after that huge spike in volatility on Monday as more than 50% of companies were declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/QXzWV6h) as even more companies continue to move below the 50-day moving average on about average volume. We saw only 2 [sectors](https://ibb.co/cT4Z90m) finishing in the green yesterday (Technology & Real Estate) while the biggest losers were in the Energy, Financial and Communications sectors as small caps continue their outperformance in the past weeks especially growth companies, while large-cap value plays lagged the market on [Tuesday](https://ibb.co/9VGmwtC).\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/34wtTb6) from yesterday, and you can that [Apple](https://ibb.co/dmNdcRy) pushed even higher, gaining almost 3% again after the reports earlier in the week of the company moving towards an EV or Self-Driving Technology play while [Tesla](https://ibb.co/r6d3Zvp) is approaching correction territory very fast as we also saw a lot more companies losing ground with big losers like Alibaba, Chevron, FB and many more.\n\nWe also got some economic data numbers yesterday as the consumer [confidence](https://ibb.co/PTT4BbQ) dropped to under 90, way below the 97 levels expected and 92.9 in the previous month. This was a result of a decline in the present situation confidence of the consumers due to the more uncertainty in the cold months. With home [sales](https://ibb.co/9TNmp0B) also falling more than expected but are still more than 25% up from a year ago with price also increasing by more than 14%.\n\nBut we did see an [improved](https://ibb.co/VxtKTwR) Q3 GDP revision up 0.3%, with most of the growth coming from [private](https://ibb.co/dcV1HkX) good & services, with 21 of the 22 industry [groups](https://ibb.co/LJDSsLW) contributing as Durable Good and Health Care helped the most, while utilities did almost nothing and mining was a negative for the US Economy.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/3cGf7HN) we have tons of economic data coming in, starting with initial and continuing jobless claims, consumer spending, core inflation, consumer sentiment index and many more, this might give the stock market some direction depending on how the data comes in.\n\nSo, we saw a stunning turn of events late yesterday as Trump signed a [stopgap](https://ibb.co/ctsF0pn) bill again to fund the US agencies for another week, but threatened to not sign the [stimulus](https://ibb.co/9Wf6n9P) bill and [demanded](https://ibb.co/sFvMkNv)  bigger stimulus checks up to $2000 for individual Americans. I think this is really more of a bluff from him, as I don\u2019t think he can do anything at this point. Even if he doesn\u2019t sign this deal, it is very likely that Congress will act quickly as the necessary veto-proof votes have been reached in both the Senate and the House, as I think, it\u2019s rather unlikely, they can negotiate more than this, as Republicans will demand something in return. Senate Leader McConell has [already](https://ibb.co/Fsn4BQy) set up a veto override effort for next Tuesday in case Trump does veto the bill, so we will have to wait and see what Trump does today, as my belief is that he did whole thing just so people wouldn\u2019t talk about the pardons he gave out yesterday.\n\nIn some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/KDDZ01D), we also saw Vaccine companies like Moderna and BioNTech continue to drop after they were hugely bought as a reaction to the vaccine news in the last months, as the new strain is causing some doubt in them, but I don\u2019t think this is going to be a problem for them, but I do still think they are way to expensive at the moment, as I said in a previous post, I think Moderna doesn\u2019t deserve more than a $100 price at the moment. And I don\u2019t even believe that Pfizer which is nearing another [deal](https://ibb.co/ggtmmXc) to provide even more doses to the US is poised for big growth ahead, the one that I am keeping an eye on is JNJ, as their vaccine only needs 1 dose and is due to have some data for release early in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile Boeing received some good [news](https://ibb.co/c8d8xFj) as Alaska Airlines announced a better deal with the company to acquire 68 planes with options for another 52 in the future. This is very good news for the company as they have had a big number of orders canceled in 2020. Alaska looked to take advantage of the reduced order backlog and probably a good discount on the deal. So yeah, full disclosure I own Boeing and I think they will do better in the next years as they are still trading well below all time-highs.\n\nWe also got news from Store Capital as they announced [rent](https://ibb.co/YLpLZVg) collections of 90% in December, on par with the last months, this is a good read on the economy, as most business manage to survive these last few months of lockdowns before things will get better and return to a more normal life & business cycle.\n\nAnd one last good piece of [news](https://ibb.co/NCB5bxJ) for us retail investors is that the NYSE approved the direct listing plan for IPOs, this will level the playing field for us everyday investors and will also provide companies with another path of going public.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/CPD8t3h) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 & Nasdaq Composite leading the way.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!
