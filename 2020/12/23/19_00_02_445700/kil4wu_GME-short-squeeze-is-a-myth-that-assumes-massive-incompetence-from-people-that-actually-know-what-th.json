{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "So with GME running the myth of the inevitable short squeeze has popped up again.  In order for this to happen a ton of people need to short the stock naked.  Which among competent investors is really fucking rare.  I will walk through it below but you can also click this link:\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021715/how-protect-short-position-options.asp\n\nFor example let\u2019s assume you wanted to short GME today at $20 a share.  So you sell 100 shares short at $20 each.  With a naked short you have unlimited losses as the stock runs up.  Nobody who knows what the fuck they are doing is going to do that when you can hedge to cap that loss.  A single January 21 call at a strike of 21 had a high of 2.42 today would hedge that just fine.\n\nYou short the shares and buy the call.  Your break even is now 17.68 on your short but your max loss is now $342 without borrowing costs assuming it closes at $20.99 on expiry.  Call expiring worthless for loss of $242 and $99 to cover the short.  \n\nBorrowing costs on 100 shares at 20% and stock at 20 is about $1 a day.  Assuming everything is held to expiry with the January expiry would be about $25.\n\nSo max loss regardless of how high the stock goes is less than $400.\n\nYour break even is kind of ass but that\u2019s because you are protected until mid Jan.  However if IV is particularly high, even if the stock goes down pushing your return on the short up, the call might still retain enough value that your break even is much higher.  \n\nIf it\u2019s a short term play which a short on today would likely be, you could buy a call for Friday which had a high of 1.15 today which puts your break even at 18.85 assuming you hold until Friday at close.  Factoring in borrowing cost it\u2019s 18.8.  \n\nThat\u2019s a hedged short which likely the vast , vast majority of GME shorts are.  Have you not noticed how fucking expensive relatively speaking call options are even with the spikes. A 20c at close with 1.5 days to expiry had a break even at 20.72 with a volume of 30,000.  Now part of that is people buying lottos but a ton of that is covering shorts.\n\nSo the whole premise of there are millions of shares that are short at $5 or $7 is some serious bullshit.  Yes there were 70m shares short give or take 2m at the end of October and there were the same number of shares short at the end of November.  This does not mean they are the same fucking people shorting it. Some have covered, some executed hedges and others have sold that shit short at higher prices.\n\nFor example today alone 8m shares were shorted.\n\nhttps://fintel.io/ss/us/gme\n\nYesterday there were 3m shares shorted.  Borrowing rates are in the 20% range, which works out to around $1 total per 100 shares.  Or a single fucking tick downward.  So no institutions aren\u2019t going to be covering shares they shorted at $15 when it spikes to $19.\n\nBut why has it been spiking if it\u2019s not a short squeeze, and that\u2019s really fucking simple, a ton of people are playing the momentum on it.  Hell 10% of the daily thread is people spamming to buy shares and you can make some money provided you don\u2019t buy the top.  Its not a coincidence that they announce the stimulus and the stock spiked and I would be willing to bet that the vast majority of shares bought today were through Robinhood.\n\nBut Cohen you say?  He added another 3%, yeah he added 3% directly on the dip after earnings.  He\u2019s in at $12 - $13 range based off the timings of the 13d.  If you are wondering what happens if he decides that the board isn\u2019t being accommodating enough and drops his shares look at what happened the day Buffet said he was dropping airlines.  He can eat the ride down to $13 and still be profitable.\n\nThen finally the biggest piece to the short squeeze is long term positive catalysts, the last significant short squeeze came from ACB two earnings ago when they closed the gap on their loss and cancelled their at the money offering.  At that point the long term growth story fundamentally changed as did the state of the business.  That\u2019s what it takes to force a short squeeze, doubling e-commerce sales when overall sales are still massively down isn\u2019t going to cut it.  A slightly green quarter during the launch of multiple new consoles isn\u2019t going to do it either.  Now if they follow that with another solidly profitable quarter in May, at that point a squeeze is possible.\n\n\nTL:DR:  The infinite short squeeze on GameStop is a bullshit argument assuming basic competence from anyone shorting the stock.  Options were in fact originally designed to offset the risks of shorting.  It will go up as long as more people are willing to become bagholders, just don\u2019t be shocked when it comes crashing down.
