Disclaimer: I am in e-commerce myself and I\u2019m in a niche within consumer electronics. Everything he mentions in the Jan 26th Forbes article is SPOT ON. \n\nBack in September, Cohen said \u201clong term, he wanted to make Gamestop a true competitor to Amazon\u201d (source A). No article in September specified  the \u201cgaming industry.\u201d To be honest, I feel that only got added in November because to be frank, no one saw it. Everyone laughed. 1:1 competitor? I\u2019m not so sure about this one. I believe in you Ryan, but this might take some time.Co-existing among eBay ($35B), BestBuy ($26.5B), Amazon in the next 2\\~3 years? 100% Doable. Being #2 amongst those names? Definitely achievable and the setup is too perfect to ignore.\n\n**Gamestop vs Amazon. Advantage Gamestop has on Amazon**\n\n* Gamestop has a location in every urban center. Even after closing 1000 locations that are losing money most likely due to them being in a mall, they still have 4000 locations. It\u2019s time to think of them as 4000 distribution points/fulfillment centers and NOT brick and mortar stores. Amazon has 175 warehouses worldwide.\n* They can deliver an item A LOT faster than Amazon or anyone else can. Almost as fast as you can get pizza/food delivery if you are in a major city.\n* Instant delivery via Doordash (piloting, but no problems yet). For the generation that want everything right now, this is great\n* Direct to consumer = no middle man = greater connection with consumers as well as greater profit.\n* Safe to say that Gamestop has experience/buying power advantage over almost all, if not ALL eBay/Amazon sellers.\n* By not having a huge warehouse and carrying 12 million SKUs, their operation is much more efficient. Consumer electronics with the exception of television, are all very compact. (It\u2019s not a loss though a TV is not a hot item people replace every couple of years).\n* They are already set up to take trade-ins of consumer electronics and already have a reputation for it.\n\n**Trade-ins? What? Now here is where it's gonna get sweet.**\n\n**Ever watch Forrest Gump? Cohen spots Forrest Gamestop sprinting through the field in a true autist form, but he sees the potential in him, as the fastest receiver of tendies. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\n* Consumer electronics is one of the most popular and one of the most profitable categories in ecommerce. Think drones, phones, computers, tablets, gaming consoles, VR\u2026 etc.\n* It also comprises the most commonly bought and sold items on local classifieds such as Craigslist, Kijiji, and Facebook marketplace.\n* When it comes to used consumer electronics, the profit margin can actually be bigger. In major cities, even as a \u2018nobody\u2019, it is not difficult to make $100 flipping devices, and flip 20 devices/week. (no repair, just be quick with cash on hand and be reliable) This is how I got started so I know firsthand.\n* Currently the only business with a global presence to facilitate buying/selling them used to have it delivered to you is eBay.\n\n**Where eBay & others fail/their MAJOR drawbacks when it comes to used or new but remember, when it comes to used, these are the ONLY names in the game.**\n\n* Long shipping times (eBay)/ many inconveniences to put up with to get the product (offline)\n* Inconsistency.\n* Risk of fraud or at the very least, risk of time being wasted leading to frustration.\n\nDo you see it now? Gamestop is a unicorn hybrid in the marketplace filling the gap between Amazon and eBay, in the most profitable and most category in ecommerce as well as offline, with faster delivery, and you can bet your ass that with Cohen running it, better customer experience.\n\nName one other business that can fill the gap.\n\n**But c\u2019mon dude. With a name like Gamestop? How do you think they can establish this in people\u2019s hearts and minds as the consumer electronics shop?**\n\nHow about this name? PowerUp, now it makes more sense, right?\n\nThey already have 55M PowerUp members, compared to 165M Amazon Prime members, it\u2019s not a lot. At the same time, it\u2019s not little, but GME has also created a revolving door by giving them more in store credit than cash for their trade ins.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nAll shorts are underwater at $16.00 right? Let me use $16.00 as an example, because it will NEVER fall below it now. Meaning? shorts will eventually HAVE TO close. Shorts closing = buying of shares =**\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\n$16 puts the market cap at $1,1B. Amongst 4000 stores. $276,000/store. Try setting up a store in locations Gamestop is set up at, with inventory and trained staff for $276,000.\n\nIt\u2019s not possible. You would probably spend that on set up/reno and inventory alone and that\u2019s not even including the brand presence that\u2019s already built into people\u2019s hearts and minds for buying and selling used consumer electronics.\n\nYeah but the valuation is low because they\u2019re losing money! Without any of the things I mentioned today materializing, they\u2019re going to be posting positive profit moving forward for sure after closing 1000 losing stores and focussing on e-commerce.\n\nGuess what though? Gamestop is already slowly gearing towards what I laid out. Check out their website. Drones, tablets, VR, phones, consoles, used games, computers.\n\n*Remember! ALL of what I laid out today, is ON TOP of the gaming foundation I laid out yesterday.*  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**\n\n**Squeeze valuation**\n\n$103 MINIMUM  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80** $326 Maximum before coming back down to $40.
