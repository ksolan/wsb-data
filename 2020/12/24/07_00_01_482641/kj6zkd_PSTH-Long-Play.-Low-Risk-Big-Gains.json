{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "#Disclaimer\n\nThis play may take several months to play out. So if you want returns fast close this out and hit up your favorite Wendy's Dumpster. Also ignore all the Stripe tinfoil shit from November. No one knows who the target is or if there is one except Pershing and the target.\n\nPSTH jumped today for no reason so wait for it to cool back down to 25 to get the numbers I am throwing around.\n\n#The play\n\nSell bull put spreads on PSTH close to NAV. The 20/22.5p spread for June is trading between 1.4 and 1.7. With a 1.4 fill that puts your breakeven at 21.10. I anticipate PSTH to run up before the next Pershing Square quarterly update. I cannot find a date but I suspect late January. Buy back your contracts during the meeting runup and resell after the drop. If Ackman releases a LOI specifying a SPAC target buy to close your position and go balls deep in long dated calls. The LOI pop should remove at least 50% of the value of your spreads. A side benefit is the put spread gives you a hedge to sell calls against your PSTH shares and still buy the calls back should there be an LOI before your sold calls expire. The acquision target really shouldn't matter. Even if we are eating fresh (Subway joke for you Gen Zer's) the target is a solid business it will run.\n\n#Downsides\n\nThe spread is wide and volume is low for June. Fucking abysmal. Just set your order and forget it. I initiated my position when the mid was 1.75. It kept dropping as I lowered my bid but PSTH market price remained the same (algo working me?) and I finally got fills at 1.4 on 12/18. So I sold 100 contracts for a 14k credit. This is a great play to sell on your margin, especially if PSTH is your collateral. This keeps diversification low WSB style and with 100 contracts your portfolio moves $1000 for every $0.10 the spread changes. Pack pepto until closer to expiry or turn your app off.\n\n#Sidenote\n\nThe mid on the June 20p is around 1. This is free money if you want to sell puts. Wait until the \"OptIOns Are GamBliNg\" crowd at r/investing finds out about low risk 10% yearly positions and comes in to chide us.\n\n#Risks\n\n* Ackman says the n word\n* The new NYSE DPO rules which allow for capital raising attract Bill's targets and PSTH just fades. After the new rules were published this week there was no drop in PSTH. Bullish\n* No target and the money goes back to holders and you, the contract seller hit max loss (just kidding you sold 2021 contracts, right?)\n\n#Upsides\n\n* With SPACs general market sentiment should not tank PSTH below 22.5\n* You can play PSTH with margin and this is super low risk. Some of the big boys got in at 23 (citation needed)\n* Here are the big players trusting Bill with their money: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/psth/institutional-holdings\n* The redemption value of this spac is 20 which really means the 20p you're buying for the spread is just buying you more margin\n\n#PSTH details if you've been living in a cave\n\nBill Ackman launched this SPAC over the summer with investor and target friendly terms unlike pretty much all other SPACs. Giant market cap and he only wants a 10% stake in a unicorn. Lots of rumors and tinfoil hat as to the targets. Nothing substantial as of yet. Ackman said Pershing was still on track for a Q1 2021 merger in November.
