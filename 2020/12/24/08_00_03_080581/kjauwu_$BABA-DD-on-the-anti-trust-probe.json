{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": " So I've been seeing a lot of posts/comments on different subs lately from new investors who are scared and are thinking of selling their BABA shares first thing tomorrow. If you are uncomfortable holding this company given the recent news, and understandably so, then go ahead - this post is not for you. It's your money, do whatever you want. But I want to make this post for the new investors who are in between/scared because they have a big position in this stock and are not sure what to do.\n\nFull disclaimer: Alibaba is my second biggest position and constitutes almost 8% of my portfolio. I have been holding this stock for a very long time and my cost basis is somewhere in the low 100s. Even I will be buying into this dip tomorrow. Let's break down some of the reasons and different scenarios:\n\n1. CCP (Chinese Communist Party) has bad blood with Jack Ma, not Alibaba. Yes Jack Ma was the founder and he still owns massive portions of the company, including portions of subsidiaries of this company, but he is no longer the CEO. If the government took some action against Jack Ma, it would not fundamentally hurt Alibaba as a whole. Let's remember, Alibaba is one of China's tech darlings. The government and their people take pride in Alibaba being one of the biggest companies in the world. CCP cares very deeply about the global image of China. They would not do anything drastic to the company that would ruin it's image or ruin the image of it's largest technology company\n2. Alibaba is facing anti-trust probes due to forcing sellers to do a pick one strategy. Right now, if vendors chose to sell on Alibaba's marketplace, they cannot sell on JD or Pinduoduo. Yes, the CCP can overturn this, and this is most likely what will happen. However, is this enough to justify the 5-10% sell-off that is coming tomorrow? Absolutely not. In fact, Alibaba trades at a 20x PE while Amazon trades at a PE above 100x. The company is already undervalued as of right now IMO.\n3. Alibaba may be forced to pay a fine to CCP: This changes absolutely nothing fundamental about the company. Alibaba is sitting on millions in cash and they generate insane levels of cash flow every quarter. Even a large fine would not hurt this company\n4. Alibaba may have to hand over some shares and ownership to CCP: This changes nothing about the company. Let's remember, the CCP essentially controls all businesses in China anyways. In particular, the CCP has always worked closely with Alibaba and Tencent anyways.\n5. Stricter regulations on Alibaba and Ant Group. This will likely happen. However, the company has already said it is willing to work with the CCP and regulators to come to an agreement.\n6. Worst case scenario: Alibaba gets broken up. Bad for Jack Ma, bad for Alibaba but GREAT for investors. If each of the parts of Alibaba were released separately into the market, Alibaba would be worth way more than what it is today. (The conglomerate discount: It's a thing, search it up)\n\nIn short, this anti-trust probe is likely just a small hiccup if you are a long term investor. CCP is most likely doing this just to remind Jack Ma and others that they are still the boss and that talking against Xi is a very bad idea, even if you are one of the richest man in the world.
