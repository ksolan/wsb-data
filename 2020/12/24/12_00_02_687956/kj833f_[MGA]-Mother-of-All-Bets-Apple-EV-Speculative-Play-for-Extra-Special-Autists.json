Sure, my DD on [SOLO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jthfu2/solo_ev_play_for_special_kind_of_retards/) has not come to fruition (yet) but 3 for 4 in the last 2 months is not too shabby. In MLB, I would be a .750 hitter and would qualify for HOF but that\u2019s a separate \u201cStory Time\u201d shit-posting for another day.\n\nToday, I am here to share my next DD. And unlike my other DDs, this is a bit speculative.\n\nTLDR: If Apple is building EVs, MGA is likely the manufacturer based on their past partnership and the fact that Apple likes to outsource manufacturing.\n\n**So, what the hell is Magna?**\n\nToday, let me tell you about this sleeping giant called MGA. Few years back (circa 2014-2016), when people first started hearing about Project Titan, aka Apple EV project, MGA was in talks to manufacture Apple EVs for Apple. Dozens of Magna\u2019s engineers were working with Apple to develop Apple\u2019s new baby. \n\nFor those who are not familiar with Magna, the company is considered as the world\u2019s biggest contract manufacturer for cars. (Think FoxConn for iPhones or Taiwan Semiconductor for chips)    A big part of their business is to help automakers to manufacture their vehicles when these automakers lack the resources (i.e. factories) or time to build the cars themselves. For OEM automakers, their current and past customers include big names like BMW, Volkswagen and Aston Martin.\n\n[Check out Bloomberg\u2019s feature on MGA back in 2016](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-magna-international/)\n\n**Ok. So they are like FoxConn and Taiwan Semiconductor, but for manufacturing cars. So why are they not \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 if they are in bed with Apple?**\n\nWell, Apple\u2019s Project Titan went through a lot of changes since 2016. It struggled with direction, leadership and technical challenges. the guy who lead the project, Bob Mansfield, left the company and then was brought back. They laid off a lot of people from the project and then retooled the scope of the project with focus on autonomous driving and a new battery technology. During this time, their previous deal with Magna also died out.\n\nBut now the project is back on track with a rumor to launch as early as 2024. Recently, various companies started mooning based on pure speculation that Apple might be using their parts for the project. (I.e. LIDAR)\n\nHowever, there\u2019s not much talk about who would build the cars. Well, Apple normally designs the product, but outsources the manufacturing. Considering that other EV manufacturers needed to build their own factories in various parts of the world, Apple would need to do the same. However, their business model would suggest that they would outsource the manufacturing and since MGA was once a partner for Project Titan, it is reasonable to think that Apple will choose MGA for future manufacturing as well. Eventually, news will reach the public but in absence of any news that Apple is making capital investment to build its own auto manufacturing factory, it would likely tap a third party like MGA because Apple lacks the expertise to manufacture cars themselves.\n\n**Ok, But what if MGA is not picked by Apple? What then?**\n\nWell, you ungrateful bastard. I\u2019ve already told you that this DD is a bit different and it\u2019s more speculative than the others. \n\nConsidering that MGA is the leader in this field, and Apple tapped them before, two things are clear. One, Apple showed their hand that they intend to outsource the manufacturing in the past. Two, MGA has the relationship and familiarity with the Apple Project. \n\nBut Magna has other trump cards in its deck. One, Fisker tapped MGA to build their electric SUVs and the production is expected to begin in 2022. As part of this deal, MGA received 6% of Fisker stock warrants so you know this relationship is going to be a long term partnership.\n\nSecondly, LG Electronics formed a joint venture with MGA to develop EV power trains and other EV parts. LG works with General Motors and Jaguar, so this joint venture can potentially lead to deals with those automakers and it positioned MGA further as a leader in this field of car manufacturing.\n\nFinally, even though they are strengthening their position in EV manufacturing, their bread and butter is their existing contracts with companies like Ford, GM, Toyota, VW and BMW. In China, MGA has even inked a deal to build entire electric cars for BAIC Group, as many as 180,000 cars annually with the first batch of cars arriving now.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nRight now the stock is trading around $70~ per share with market cap of only $22 Billion. \n\nOver the next 12 - 24 months, EVs continue to be a hot topic. As more and more people convert to EVs, more EV stocks will moon and MGA will benefit from that conversion. But, if and when Apple confirms MGA as their manufacturer as they disclose more info about their EV between now and 2024, this stock will \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 beyond your dreams.
