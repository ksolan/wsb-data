{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Fresh off another two day ban, I\u2019m back to share some IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS.\n\nFirst though, a couple of things:\n\n1.  I joined Reddit two years ago, because someone suggested I look at something on there, haven\u2019t used it until recently when my son rushed me to start posting because I helped a lot of people on the way down and on the way back up make $. \n\n2.  I\u2019ve been in the steel business for 25 years and own my own company with sales and operations throughout US, Canada and Mexico. I no longer handle the day to day, but am still President.  I\u2019m also helping an EV company I invested in procure steel from my many contacts I have bought from and made over 25 years in the business. I also have some Domino\u2019s pizza franchises. I can tell you when to short them and Papa John\u2019s. It all has to do with the price of block cheese on the CME. If it eclipses $3.00/lb - it starts being an unprofitable business. That almost happened in June of this year when it hit $2.89/lb. \n\nTo whomever the asshats are that think I\u2019m a MM/hedge fund - you should keep crawling down that rabbit hole you fucking retard. \n\nLook, this is my take and I\u2019m deep into it - I\u2019m cutting purchases orders daily for wire rod and steel plate for our manufacturing in Monterrey, Mexico with $MT and none of the purchase orders have prices on them. They are merely place holders in line and that line has now stretched until June. The orders will be placed at price time of shipment.\n\nTHIS DID NOT EVEN HAPPEN IN 2008. \n\nAs for $MT, yes they are different company than in 2008 when two companies combined to form $MT a couple years prior. \n\nThey have spent the past 14 years getting rid of the dead weight and older, non-strategic facilities and investing in smarter, value-added ones. \n\nIt is all going to pay off - and I believe NOW is the time. \n\nI also buy a lot of steel from US domestic suppliers and they are facing a scrap increase that we have NEVER seen. \n\nShredded steel scrap - the main ingredient in US steel making jumped three times this past month for a total increase of $135/ton. \n\nThis is UNPRECEDENTED and will be passed on 100% to customers in the for of new orders. \n\nThis is what I got yesterday from someone inside one of the largest steel mills in the US:\n\nSays scrap will be up $70/ton in January.\n \nLook for another $3.00/cwt + increase\n \nThey also went up immediately the full increase on \u201cnew orders\u201d for 20\u2019 rebar\n \nScrap brokers are short shipping to domestic mills\u2026he said if a mill buys 10K tons of scrap , they receive 7K ton. This is putting a strain on their supply.\n\nStrain on supply = less supply finished goods = demand very high = MUCH MUCH higher prices. \n\nTHIS IS A GLOBAL situation. \n\nSo much in fact, China decided to pass this, which came across last night from one of my brokers in Tokyo:\n\nMEIS2020: China's next move on steel scrap imports will move global markets, Turkey panelists say\nChina resuming steel scrap imports in 2021 will directly affect global steel markets because of supply shortages, speakers on the Turkey panel at Fastmarkets' recent Middle East Iron and Steel virtual conference said. \nChina will end the ban on imports of ferrous scrap on January 1 after it  reclassified certain qualities steelmaking raw materials under the new regulations.  \nOn December 23, China's Ministry of Finance also announced the country will remove its 2% import tax rate on ferrous scrap and revive its most-favored-nation duty rate system from January 1. \nG\u00f6rkem Bolaca, managing director at international trading firm Galex Steel International, expects China to start importing about 15-20 million tonnes of scrap in 2021. \nTurkey imported 18,856,851 tonnes of steel scrap in 2019, according to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK). This figure made Turkey the biggest scrap importer in the world last year. \nGlobally, about 100 million tonnes of scrap is traded every year, and China's expected import volumes will have a direct affect on global steel production, conference delegates heard. \nDidem Taskiran, sales manager at Turkish steelmaker \u00c7olakoglu, said the impact of China's decision has already been observed in the steel sector. Scrap prices have increased sharply since the beginning of November, when rumors of the imminent new regulation started to be heard. \nFastmarkets' daily index for steel scrap, HMS 1&2 (80:20 mix), North Europe origin, cfr Turkey was calculated at $462.78 per tonne on December 22, up nearly 50% from $308.60 per tonne on November 17.  \n\"We expect scrap prices to go up further,\" Taskiran said, adding that Chinese demand for scrap will mostly be for shredded and bonus scrap. \n\"We [as Turkish steel producers] are importing a lot, and local scrap supply is not enough for local production.\nChinese imports will affect the prices on an upward trend. Unlike flat steel, long steel prices are directly affected by scrap costs.\nIn addition, if China starts importing scrap, they will be ready to pay any price,\" she said. \n\"We expect China to start importing scrap in June,\" Taskiran added. \nIn the wider context of the steel scrap market, availability of steel scrap is limited. \nRussia's Ministry of Economic Development has approved an amendment to its export duty on ferrous scrap to raise the minimum duty to ?45 per tonne to combat the threat of a shortage of steelmaking raw materials in the domestic market. The duty is expected to be imposed in early 2021, according to a source close to the matter. \nErsun \u00d6zdemirel, strategy and marketing manager at Turkish flats re-roller and coated steel producer Borcelik, said decisions to switch to electric arc furnace production, which uses scrap as a feedstock, rather than blast furnaces could be driven by environmental concerns. \nThe European Commission is reviewing European Union rules on waste shipments to encourage more recycling within the EU and is exploring ways to reduce the exports of such materials. \n\"The European Union especially is working to reduce carbon emissions and in mid-2021 they will announce Green Deal regulations. If they apply the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), EAF production will be advantageous and we will see demand for scrap increase,\" \u00d6zdemirel said. \n\"In the future, scrap might be scarce and much more valuable,\" he forecasted. \nEurope and the United States have a 80% share in Turkey's scrap imports. The country also uses hot briquetted iron for steel production, mainly imported from Libya and Russia.\n\nOk, so we already have an iron ore shortage and prices at ATH. \n\nNow, China is targeting steel scrap because they can\u2019t get enough raw material to take care of their own infrastructure needs. \n\nThis will MOVE THE GLOBAL markets as it says above. \n\nHow does $MT fit in - it\u2019s simple they will be selling product at much higher prices with higher revenues = higher margins = higher EPS. \n\nFor you fucking retards simple math:\n\nIf you normally sell a product at $600/ton and your margin is 20% - you are making $150/ton. \n\nWith increases you sell the same product for $1000/ton and your margin is 20% (maybe more for an integrated manufacturer like $MT) your margin is $250 per ton. \n\nYou have increased sales and revenue by by 66% on the same business EVEN if your business volume stays flat - which it isn\u2019t. \n\nTheir business is growing and their PT has been increased by Goldman\u2019s, Jeffries and KeyBanc. \n\nI got banned for posting the KeyBanc increase. \n\nAnyhow - make your own decisions. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to buy $MT - don\u2019t. \n\nGood luck to the believers!", "author_fullname": "t2_10x7vki9", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "$MT - Update #3 and why it will \ud83d\ude80", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_kjg7nh", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 111, "total_awards_received": 4, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 111, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1608824798.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\u001b201222:2:1"}], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1608848558.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Fresh off another two day ban, I\u2019m back to share some IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS.</p>\n\n<p>First though, a couple of things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I joined Reddit two years ago, because someone suggested I look at something on there, haven\u2019t used it until recently when my son rushed me to start posting because I helped a lot of people on the way down and on the way back up make $. </p></li>\n<li><p>I\u2019ve been in the steel business for 25 years and own my own company with sales and operations throughout US, Canada and Mexico.
