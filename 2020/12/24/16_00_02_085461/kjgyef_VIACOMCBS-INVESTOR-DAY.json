WTF is fast ok so this is really cool and the future of linear TV or traditional TV.The service (Free Ad Supported Streaming TV) is a type of product and Pluto was acquired by viacom in 2019 for peanuts. The most recent quarter showed the revenue doubled for Pluto and they launched a showtime channel to drive subs to showtime. Pluto is great for monetizing library content. Example there is a this old house channel, a MTV cribs channel a few comedy channels with Comedy Central stand up and shows and a Dora the explorer channel. Also a channel that plays James Bond movies 24/7. Essentially fast is free streaming paid for by ads. No box or subscription just turn it on.

I expect the firm will still produce for others like NFLX and AMZN. \n\nShowtime is also a great brand and with the collapse of creativity and thought at HBO I like it even more for edgy drama and comedy. HBO was once the leader in top shelf content but they are going main stream and poorly executed.
