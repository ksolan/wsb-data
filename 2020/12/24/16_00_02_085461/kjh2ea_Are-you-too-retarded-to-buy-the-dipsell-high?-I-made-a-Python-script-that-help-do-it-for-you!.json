I come to you today after countless days of FOMO-ing the top, and panic selling the bottom. Paper hands is a *DISEASE* that plagues many of us, and I am no stranger to it. One day, I decided that I'm simply too fucking retarded to remove my emotions from trading entirely, and so I decided to try to get my computer to do it for me. I think I was pretty successful, but you can judge for yourself. If you want, you can download the code and try out my algorithm, or you can easily design and test your own!\n\n**The Algorithm**\n-\nThe algorithm is tested on the past 3 years of close prices for a particular stock. It does not have any information about the dataset beyond the current point (i.e. I made sure it doesn't cheat by looking into the future). The algorithm starts with 100 shares of the stock, and then each day either decides to Buy, Sell, or Hold. The returns generated by the algorithm are compared to those generated by a simple buy-and-hold from the start. The results are shown below, check out those sexy graphs:\n\n--\n**Results**\n--\n-\nTicker: [BABA](https://imgur.com/TwOShiK)\n\nBuy-and-Hold Returns: +$17140.42\n\nAlgorithm Returns: +$19274.65\n\n******\nTicker: [IBM](https://imgur.com/lhWY5yX)\n\nBuy-and-Hold Returns: -$1,376.32\n\nAlgorithm Returns: +$403.09\n\n******\nTicker: [PEN](https://imgur.com/B4myQ0t)\n\nBuy-and-Hold Returns: +$11,794.99\n\nAlgorithm Returns: +$13,176.74\n\n******\nTicker: [GOOG](https://imgur.com/wl01kRr)\n\nBuy-and-Hold Returns: +$94,486.99\n\nAlgorithm Returns: +$82,392.37\n\n******\nTicker: [SPCE](https://imgur.com/mrIUnX1)\n\nBuy-and-Hold Returns: +$1,373.99\n\nAlgorithm Returns: +$1612.49\n\n---\n\nAs you can see, most of the time the algorithm is successful. It out performed Buy-and-Hold for ~80% of the tickers that I tried it on. And I think one of the best indicators of success is that it made money even when IBM went down over the last 3 years. However it is far from perfect, because the weights/thresholds that the algorithm uses seem to stop working for lower priced stocks. (For example the algo has trouble with tickers like GE). More work is needed to generalize to algorithm to handle a broad range of tickers.\n\nThis is where you come in hopefully. I urge you all to fork the repository and download the code and try it out for yourself. Feel free to make changes and modify the algorithm and submit a pull request on GitHub. The goal here is to generalize the algorithm so that it out performs Buy-and-Hold across the market. \n\nI have set up the script in such a way so that all you need to modify is the Decide() method to create and test your own algorithm. My algorithm uses various moving averages and their derivatives to make decisions. Those moving average functions and their slope/concavity/etc are calculated for each iteration and made available for the user to use in the Decide() method to design their own algorithm. \n\n**Download the Code** \n-\n[Link to GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ryantcullen/stock-bot)\n\nPlease fork the repository and submit a pull request if you see something you want to add/change.
