Then,This year I lost damn near everything in my account ( 70k down to 6k)  when the Vid' hit in march.  I diamond handed to the bottom and then foolishly decided to sell thinking it would keep dropping and I could buy back in super fucking low.... only to sell at the bottom and watch the rocket to recovery leave me at the bottom of the trench.... Then I bitterly doubled down on a retarded theory that it would crash again and I could catch the second wave.  Bitter and anxious how I would recover from my retarded decisions I decided to started looking for a place to learn how to be a more informed trader, how to find the right stocks, how to not be a retard.\n\nThen I found you guys!
