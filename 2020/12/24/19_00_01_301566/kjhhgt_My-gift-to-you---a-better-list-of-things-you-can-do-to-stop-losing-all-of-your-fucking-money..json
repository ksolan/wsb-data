He\u2019s hawking TradingView. His post is an advertisement masquerading as enlightenment on reading charts. He doesn\u2019t know shit about making money. \n\nLearn the story on a stock \u2014 the company \u2014 and not some tick mark bullshit on a squiggly fucking line.\n\nHis post: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kj7p0e/my_gift_to_you_a_list_of_things_you_can_do_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n(2) The best stock pickers are only correct about 40% to 50% of the time. That\u2019s right, not as often as you think!  \n\nWhat does it mean to be \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d? Here\u2019s the answer: \n\nJust because you made or lost money doesn\u2019t mean you are right or wrong. You always have a choice, invest in Stock A, invest in a broad market index, or do nothing.  You might be up 10% YTD and feel great, but the S&amp;P 500 is up 14% YTD. You could have made more money with substantially less risk compounding with an index.\n\n(3) Are you better than the index? Find out!  Practice on tools like caps.fool.com. Make a pick and see how it performs against the market. If you don\u2019t know if you are right or wrong you won\u2019t learn how to make money. \n\n(4) You aren\u2019t going to make \u201cboy band\u201d money if you lose a lot of money.  When you gamble on a speculative stock and lose 80%, you need a 400% return to get back to even.  If you can steadily make 7%, do it 10 times in a row and you\u2019ve made 100%.  Or at 10%, it\u2019s 7 times. There will of course be volatility and varying time horizons. But, aim to (mostly) round the bases with singles, not (always) trying to swing for the fences with a cucumber as a bat. Fake internet points from loss porn are not badges of honor. You think the game different this time? It\u2019s not. Degenerates have gambled since the beginning of markets. An irrationally exuberant market on a stock will end.  Do yourself a favor and learn to be better.  Having some speculative picks is fine \u2014 just understand and accept the inherent risks and volatility.\n\n(5) Have a bazooka gun of cash ready when quality goes on sale.  You will have a chance to buy most companies at a fair price. There will be pull backs and market dislocations. Be ready. Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Facebook, Intuitive Surgical, and many of the best performing stocks of all time have gone on sale \u2014 many times.  Be ready when the market corrects and buy quality. Be patient!  Don\u2019t have always FOMO.\n\n(6) Market corrections with declines of between 10% and 20% happen about 2.5 times each year on average (source: Guggenheim). The average bear market lasts 18 months. Know this and use it to your advantage. Don\u2019t panic sell quality names. Stay calm. If you don\u2019t need the money to survive today, leave it alone. If you do, what the fuck were you doing investing in stocks?  Think about this. How will you act WHEN markets correct next?\n\n(7) Most of your investment returns are going to come from just a few of your stock picks. Let the winners run!  At some point you\u2019ll consider rebalancing \u2014 that\u2019s smart and okay. But having an oversized winner at 15% of your stock portfolio can be okay (if it\u2019s a quality stock, not speculative). Let compound returns take over.  Nothing is better than crushing the market with 1% gain from a compounding stock. Better yet, when that 1% gain is MORE than your cost basis.\n\n(8) Trading isn\u2019t therapy for boredom. Go play with yourself and then go for a walk. Trading isn\u2019t going to make your day better.  Have the discipline to trade less, not more.  \n\n(9) Read more. Do you even know what you are investing in?  Know everything about your stocks. For 30+ years now all information ever published is at your fingertips. Yet, most of you won\u2019t bother doing your own research. Readings someone else\u2019s pitch (or article) can help you get started.  But go read the 10-K.  Read industry data. Twitter and message boards are full of morons with pump and dump agendas. Do basic research yourself. Do people like working there? How can that company make more money? Betting on companies is a very different mindset than just betting on tickers. Bet on companies. \n\n(10) What can you learn about a company that (practically) no one else knows.  Make a thesis. Will Facebook be successful on mobile?  Can Microsoft move its massive enterprise software business to the cloud?  Can RiteAid compete with online pharmacies?  Can Google close it\u2019s acquisition of FitBit?\n\n(11) Investor Relations doesn\u2019t care about your cost basis or the number of shares that you own. They don\u2019t. Management says they respect investors \u2014 but they mostly don\u2019t give a shit. Jeff Bezos carves out 6 hours a year to talk to investors \u2014 just to be polite. Management teams are trying to run a complex enterprise, with major human capital issues. Most management teams are incentivized to build value over eternity. They don\u2019t give a shit about your time horizon.  Most care about themselves first, employees second, customers third, suppliers fourth, partners fifth, the community sixth, and investors last. There\u2019s very little that a company can do to affect share price in the short term.\n\n(12) Add to your winners. Don\u2019t double down on losers, double up on winners. \n\n(13) Find stocks that aren\u2019t always in the headlines. Headlines lead to redlines.  If the story is in the news, you are probably too late (for now). Buying a stock isn\u2019t like lining up to buy one of a limited number of holiday cakes. There\u2019s always more stock.  Wait until the news cycle forgets about the stock and then consider buying. Do research first.\n\n(14) If you can\u2019t sleep at night because you own a stock, you should NOT own that stock. Stocks don\u2019t cuddle. They are like a brutally honest toddler with mood swings and basic needs. Overtime they might grow into a good adult but keep your expectations inline. It\u2019s a long road to adulthood.\n\n(15) Lastly, what do you want the future to look like. Get off the of the news cycle and quarterly earnings game. Go find stocks that are FOCUSED on being massively better and more important in 5+ years. Price targets for these types of companies are bullshit. They always have been and they always will be. You\u2019ll be amazed by what focused teams \u2014 motivated by making a better world \u2014 can achieve. The stock price simply weighs this impact \u2014 it doesn\u2019t mean you a genius. You didn\u2019t do the science. Be humble and donate some to charity and help the impoverished, because you were just a spectator holding shares.\n\nTLDR: u/BeardlessPete is a moron.
