{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "The Coca Cola purchase was famous because it was the first major investment where Buffett paid much more relative to earnings and assets than he did for most of his other investments.\n\nWarren Buffett and Charlie Munger started buying Coca Cola in 1988. By the end of the year, Berkshire Hathaway owned 14,172,500 shares which cost $592.54 million. In 1989, they bought 9,177,500 additional shares for $431.38 million. By the end of 1989, they owned a total of 23,350,000 shares or 6.2% of the company which they bought for $1.023 billion.

This equates to $394,500 as of March 26, 2020. If you had reinvested dividends, your investment would be worth over $10 million.
