I see it myself. Thank you to all that offered constructive criticism.\n\n**\\*\\*If you still worry that Gamestop might go back down to $16.00, I invite you to take a few minutes to read this as this would put the concern to rest.

Of course you can.**\n\nOne day you buy a 1080P drone, next year they come out with 2.7K, next year they come out with 4K, year after that they come out with a 4K that fits in your pocket, and you can\u2019t help but feel like you are just living in the past, or at least, left feeling like you are holding the bag like you bought PLTR at $29.\n\nI have some of those devices, and I end up upgrading AT LEAST one of them every 1\\~2.5 years just like you.\n\n* Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if there was a place nearby that you can just go to get a fair value for your trade in (maybe $50 less than you could get online but you don\u2019t have to waste any time)?\n* Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if there was a brick and mortar place nearby you can count on that can\u2019t just change their number/disappear tomorrow, have the ability to deliver your order to you in 1 hour AND offer returns AND offer 90 days warranty? What? I can buy extended warranty too?\n* If there was one, and you just had to pay $50 on top of what you could find them for online otherwise, would you really bother with anything else? Would anyone?\n\n**Don\u2019t think about Gamestop for a second and be honest with yourself. If you answered yes to all 3, upvote this post. If you answered no to any of the above, just give it some time. You just haven\u2019t experienced the inconvenience/pain yet.**\n\nOk, I get your point but there is no one that can offer something like this. Not **yet.**\n\nLook, I know back in our days, Gamestop is where you went to get hustled but that\u2019s going to change 180.\u2019 Gamestop will change its name to \u201cPowerUp\u201d to be relevant in the broader consumer electronics field while retaining its gaming foundation.\n\nSo Ryan Cohen showed you guys that he\u2019s serious about buying Gamestop upping his stake recently. It also said in 13D that he will do whatever is in the shareholders\u2019 best interest. There was no new 13D posted today. **Meaning? The price rise was organic this week. Not from him buying. Shorts shook you a couple of times. You guys held. You guys did very good.**\n\nHave you ever looked into what Chewy does in terms of customer service? Have you read up anything about Ryan Cohen to see what he/his father stands/stood for when it comes to customer experience? They are about selling goods that will make the customer the most happy not selling stuff that makes the most profit, funny enough, profit follows when you give customers what would make them the most happy and you end up making the most profit anyways. I speak from experience.\n\nWhat made Bezos so successful is his focus on customer experience also. All entrepreneurs out there, please remember my spiel about customer experience at least. It\u2019s the realest thing I or anyone can tell you. Do not ever fight with customers. Kill them with kindness if anything.\n\nI bet you my last dollar this is what Cohen sees in Gamestop. The locations, the brand presence, 55M PowerUp members many of whom are already cultured on going through Gamestop\u2019s revolving door because you get more store credit than cash and you are just accustomed to it.\n\n**But c\u2019mon man $50? How is the company going to make any money?** Look at the spread between bid and ask. It\u2019s $50 each way from the mid-price (fair market price). That\u2019s $100.00 profit for the company.\n\nStill, only $100.00? Yeah, that\u2019s actually 2X what they make off of console sales.\n\nEvery one of you, I know you said yes to my questions above, so do the math, upgrading at least one of the devices every 1\\~2.5 years. Under this vision, it will be like 10 new consoles are being released every year for Gamestop AT LEAST. It will AT LEAST outdo BestBuy 26.55B market cap. Meaning Gamestop will do at least 20X within the next 5 years.\n\n**\u201cYeah but Amazon sells used too? Didn\u2019t you see?\u201d**\n\nNot like this. Used items on Amazon is more like buying stuff on eBay. Often relying on the seller\u2019s description and the seller\u2019s shipping. Can you drop your item off to Amazon and get cash? No\n\nImagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss.\n\nThen, after you bought the device, they just do this 1 simple thing.\n\n1 week after you bought the thing they send you a text\n\n*\u201cHey Autist, just wanted to check in, how\u2019s your new dildo flexing so far? It\u2019s gwon? Iight, good to hear. We are here if you have any questions/concerns. Have a nice day\u201d*\n\nCohen will do at least this. I guarantee you, except he will add some more personal/relatable touch like \u201cthe 4K 69 Mega Pixel camera on that bitch really is something else huh?\u201d As a cherry on top, there it is, one thing we can\u2019t mistake for anything else. A FUCKIN ROCKET EMOJI at the end of the message. Wouldn\u2019t you feel loved?  \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Oh yeah, add this to the books.** With millions of us retail WSB autists holding GME, think about what that does for the PR when the squeeze happens and it WILL HAPPEN because $16 is where all the shorts are under water, and we ARE NEVER going below that. They\u2019re paying fees right now and they will eventually cover. It will do wonders for the business' image.\n\nGood chance the squeeze will happen like Tesla\u2019s, 4X+ ing over a couple of months as they start to prove their vision and show that they are there to stay. (Source A). This is the bare minimum (or bear minimum). GME squeeze set up is a lot more potent but 'slowly but surely' is how it typically squeezes against diamond hands, diamond balls institutional shorts. 10X+++ ing as they bring their vision to reality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[See October 19 to Feb 20](https://preview.redd.it/zag3ukfz57761.jpg?width=959&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba0b9ad0b7878c5f6fd49829d2fe16e719320ee4)\n\nThat is of course, unless Cohen was just waiting for the new year for tax purposes to acquire more and announce that \u201coh yeah guys, I actually have enough options, shares now to buy the company\u201d\n\nHe rides the squeeze, sell 25% shares, profit from that alone will pay for the business acquisition when it comes back down to its value as it is today of around $40 before heading to outdo BestBuy as I mentioned before (20X, that's $400/share in 5 years -being conservative, it can happen in less time\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80). The positive profit they would MOST CERTAINLY generate from this console cycle will more than pay for the restructuring. He still remains a major shareholder with 25%. His best interest will always be scaling GME.\n\nSherman for example, he owns 2% Bezos owns a little over 10%\n\n**Do you want to think really long term?**\n\nYouTube knew from Day 1 they were going to put ads one day, but they wanted to make it as sweet as possible for it to be engrained in you first \u2013 think video, think Youtube.\n\nThe day will come, think upgrading your device, whether it is new or used, think **PowerUP (more suitable name than Gamestop while retaining the gaming image)**\n\nMy point is, that they can increase the $100 spread if they wanted to, once it's habitual for us to make the sale/trade/purchase of a consumer electronics device at PowerUP as it is for us to order something on Amazon right now. For devices that are less liquid like computers/laptops the spread will likely be bigger from the start of course.That's only if you are still so hung up on making only $100/device because I, a nobody without a store/reputation could easily run around myself and flip 20 devices/week. Try it. Consumer electronics in a high population density areas are SUPER LIQUID. Remember Gamestop is everywhere dense population is (not talking the smooth brain kind of dense here)\n\nHow about this? When you bring your trade in, you get only $50 less than the classifieds\u2019 resale value when you take store credit, but if you want cash, we can only give you $75 less than the classifieds\u2019 resale value and vice versa. There, I just made the spread 50% more, $150 profit/device for Gamestop, and I made you more likely to return. Happy?\n\nBezos knew he wasn\u2019t going to sell just books down the road.  \nElon Musk knew he wasn\u2019t signing up to build just cars.  \nSavvy business people that can build billion dollar business from scratch like Ryan, Elon and Bezos can anticipate moves years down the road.\n\nThe sky is the limit.\n\n**We are just at the beginning, and I'm not done yet.You think I'm out to lunch? They're already getting started in the broader consumer electronics field (as mentioned in Pt2 of my DD). If you really can't relate, it's ok, it's probably because you are deep in #1 (as mentioned in Pt1 of my DD)**\n\nMy position:  Shares as well as options JAN 15 15C, 30C, APR 16 30C. GME makes majority of my port.\n\nP.S :\n\nRyan, if you are reading this. I know you see the picture because it's the obvious picture. I\u2019m in the space, and you\u2019re right on the money in regards to the things you preach and do in regards to customer service/customer experience. I got some ideas brainstormed from writing these DDs I can offer (not asking for anything). I can see where you can save in shipping between stores, how the listing \u2018system\u2019 can be so all employees can take pictures and describe the items with consistency like how all McDonalds employees can make burgers with consistency\u2026 etc etc just to start. Feel free to reach out to me.No? Ok, you will compete with me a few years down the road. Just kidding.\n\n**To all you guys & Ryan. Happy Holidays/Merry Christmas.Wishing you and your family nothing but the best this holiday season, yours truly**\n\n**- Dildoflexing (You can call me Greendildoflexing when it squeezes)**\n\nSource (A)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/danrunkevicius/2020/07/20/tesla-stock-may-be-rallying-for-this-absurd-reasonand-this-wont-end-well/?sh=f57ad4767a66](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danrunkevicius/2020/07/20/tesla-stock-may-be-rallying-for-this-absurd-reasonand-this-wont-end-well/?sh=f57ad4767a66)", "author_fullname": "t2_7gwj942d", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "GME DD fresh perspectives Pt 3 Future of Gamestop + Squeeze teaser.

Happy?</p>\n\n<p>Bezos knew he wasn\u2019t going to sell just books down the road.<br/>\nElon Musk knew he wasn\u2019t signing up to build just cars.<br/>\nSavvy business people that can build billion dollar business from scratch like Ryan, Elon and Bezos can anticipate moves years down the road.</p>\n\n<p>The sky is the limit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We are just at the beginning, and I&#39;m not done yet.You think I&#39;m out to lunch?

I\u2019m in the space, and you\u2019re right on the money in regards to the things you preach and do in regards to customer service/customer experience. I got some ideas brainstormed from writing these DDs I can offer (not asking for anything). I can see where you can save in shipping between stores, how the listing \u2018system\u2019 can be so all employees can take pictures and describe the items with consistency like how all McDonalds employees can make burgers with consistency\u2026 etc etc just to start. Feel free to reach out to me.No? Ok, you will compete with me a few years down the road. Just kidding.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To all you guys &amp; Ryan.
