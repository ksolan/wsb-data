{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I am so fucking bullish on a number of disruptive technologies (many of which I share with Cathie) and I have been for years. I'm bored at a xmas party so just throwing this out there off the top of my head for all you retards considering hopping on the ARK train. Here is a quick and dirty rundown on why I'm hyper-bullish in these sectors:\n\n**- AI (and robotics):** if you thought the interwebs revolutionized the world by creating new massive industries like e-commerce and social media, wait til AI starts getting involved in a seriously major way. It's in its infancy still as a technology but think about the impact to autonomous driving/ridesharing taxi networks and shipping, traffic engineering and city planning, healthcare, military applications, roboinvesting, manufacturing, precise operations like controlling a spacecraft, advanced chemistry, literally anything that requires predictive analytics or in-depth parsing of huge data sets that a human simply could never do.\n\nHuman error and psychological bias are enormous contributors to loss of revenue and life. In 20 or 30 years, any office worker who pushes paperwork or does other menial work could be obsolete if their company can afford an AI software suite that can process that tasking at 10 or 20 or 100 times the speed with essentially zero errors.\n\nRobotics will give AI suites and other software-based decision-making entities the ability to perform physical work. They can keep human operators outside of dangerous or difficult situations. Major manufacturing companies are buying into robotics hard for their production lines.\n\nI like teradyne for robotics and C3 for AI. I am looking for more tickers to buy on both.\n\n**- Precision/Personalized Medicine (Telemed, but largely Genomics):**\n\nTelemedicine and small partially automated clinics will eliminate the need to see a primary care physician or psychiatrist for something as minor as a check up, flu shot, or strep throat swab. Decentralization of healthcare is already a worldwide trend.\n\nGenetic sequencing is the big one. Genome sequencing cost for the first human genome cost $2.7B and 13 years. It is now approaching $1000 - technologies like this are finally at the point where they are ready to go to market and not just R&D pipe dreams. Companies like 23&Me are first movers in bringing personalized genetics to the public. Imagine if you could have a service like that flag the fact that you're likely to develop breast cancer and catch it at stage one? Imagine if it could tell you what kind of beer you're most likely to enjoy? Imagine if you could edit a chronic illness out of your unborn child. There are obviously regulatory and ethical implications here but that won't stop the industry from growing.\n\nI am so fucking bullish on CRSP long-term despite this run up. We are already at a stage where research firms are targeting monogenic diseases (only one gene mutated, easier to fix). CRSP, EDIT and NTLA are the only three companies with patents filed for CRISPR gene editing technology. Buy. The opportunity is so much greater than the premium you think you might be paying to buy this high.\n\n\\- **Digital Payments:** Cash payments are at an all-time low in global history yet there is still plenty of room for cash payments to transition to digital. Companies like venmo and square are now up-ending the finance industry by controlling digital cash flow more than traditional banking institutions you are. Answer me this: when was the last time you went to the bank in person to withdraw cash for your daily expenses? For me it was probably 2012. There are entire markets in Africa where people are only just starting to use SMS money-gram type mobile payment things. Mobile payments will rule the world of transactions soon.\n\nP o o p c o i n is extremely controversial right now but at the very least, it is an indicator that **institutional** interest in digital payments and mobile value transfer is strong and growing. You might also consider it more of an asset/store of value than a medium for value exchange, but either way. Adoption is increasing. Access is increasing. Awareness is increasing. Faith in fiat currencies is decreasing (consider Venezuela. lol. and the USD fears recently). These are all bull signals.\n\nFintech is one of my strongest conviction buys. SQ, PYPL\n\n**- Batteries - Energy storage:**\n\nThe global developed economy runs on the combustion engine / fossil fuel power plant. Forget about activism and ESG funds for a second and think about this: *when do new services or technologies get adapted over existing ones that serve a similar function?*\n\nAnswer: *when they become cheaper than the status quo solutions.* Battery technology research drive is insane right now as we've seen by the hype around EV and charging tech companies. Batteries are the primary cost driver of an electric vehicle - it's like more than half of the cost of the input material. Once battery prices cross a tipping point and electric vehicles become cheaper than gasoline cars, there will be a mass exodus to EVs. EVs have less moving parts than a gasoline car so they require less maintenance, and they have greater power efficiency too. This may have become a little bit of a bubble recently, but I honestly am so bullish on the long term case I don't care. Ride out pumps and dumps and stay invested in your thesis. Long-term energy storage is also critical for distributed energy networks (imagine people are generating solar at home, banking it, and then using it at night or selling it back to the grid when prices are highest intraday)\n\nTSLA here. not sure what else to add yet. everything else seems pump and dumpy but I am in battery metal mining ETFs hard.\n\n\\- **3D printing:**\n\nIndustrial 3d printing is huge. Aerospace and medical devices are the best use cases here.\n\n**- Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Cybersecurity:**\n\nThese are critical infrastructure systems needed to create a functional ecosystem for things like AI, robotics, etc, but there are other drives besides. the amount of data collection and analytics worldwide is ATH and will only go up. and people love their smart homes and devices lol. IoT makes technology an environment and not just a device.

My question is, could a 35% drop over a month in the S&P possibly come from retail investors who go rogue and don\u2019t follow conventional wisdom, go against their financial advisors advice, and sell off a significant chunk of equities?  I would think the retail investors I just described make up a very small percentage of retail investors.  And retail investors make up a small portion of the money invested.  \n\nI think it would make much more sense that all the institutional investors would have to be the ones selling causing this massive drop.  \n\nNow, would you rather model your trading/investing around people who do it for a living, or people who aren\u2019t really sure how to check their 401k balance and probably don\u2019t even know what they hold or how to sell if they wanted to?\n\nConventional wisdom allows average Joe\u2019s to hold the bags, while the institutions sell early and buy back in once a support is found. \n\nWhich investing strategy is best for you?  I think it depends.  If you literally watch your positions and follow markets daily, probably better to try and do what the pros do.  If you look at it once a month, you\u2019d probably be late to sell and late to buy back in which case holding would probably be better. \n\nI cut my losses gradually and my lowest point was about 18-20% down from Feb highs.

My question is, could a 35% drop over a month in the S&amp;P possibly come from retail investors who go rogue and don\u2019t follow conventional wisdom, go against their financial advisors advice, and sell off a significant chunk of equities?  I would think the retail investors I just described make up a very small percentage of retail investors.  And retail investors make up a small portion of the money invested.  </p>\n\n<p>I think it would make much more sense that all the institutional investors would have to be the ones selling causing this massive drop.  </p>\n\n<p>Now, would you rather model your trading/investing around people who do it for a living, or people who aren\u2019t really sure how to check their 401k balance and probably don\u2019t even know what they hold or how to sell if they wanted to?</p>\n\n<p>Conventional wisdom allows average Joe\u2019s to hold the bags, while the institutions sell early and buy back in once a support is found. </p>\n\n<p>Which investing strategy is best for you?  I think it depends.  If you literally watch your positions and follow markets daily, probably better to try and do what the pros do.  If you look at it once a month, you\u2019d probably be late to sell and late to buy back in which case holding would probably be better. </p>\n\n<p>I cut my losses gradually and my lowest point was about 18-20% down from Feb highs.  I eased back in once it started to look safer.  I\u2019m up about 60% on the year because of it.  Thats in an account where I just hold stock and sell covered calls.
