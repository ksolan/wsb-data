They do various tech products and services such as cloud, 5G, fiber etc. for especially metro but also long haul and other transportation.\n\n**Financials**  \nFirst off, the company is mature and has a strong focus on gross margin, cost cutting as well as constantly moving into new, growing and promising markets.\n\nFrom Q1'19 to Q3'20 (GAAP):  \nRevenue is up 16.5%  \nGross margin is up from 22.7% to 35.2%  \nOPEX is down from $178.1M to $112.6M  \nEPS is up from ($.69) to ($.19)\n\nWhile these financials are solid, they are not the flashiest found in the market. However, it is more so the current situation of the company as well as the outlook that could drive the stock through the roof in Q1 of 2021.\n\n**Circumstances**  \nHistorically, the number one competitor of $INFN has been Huawei. Because of the recent developments for Huawei's operations in especially North America ($INFN's largest market), American customers are looking to switch to a solid American alternative.\n\nNot only is California-based $INFN an innovative and proven alternative, it is also becoming more relevant in more areas (vertical integration). This makes it an obvious choice because of the all-in-one solutions they can provide for their customers, of which they are gaining by the minute (take a look in their financial statements).\n\nFinally, the central metro market is only growing, both in the US, but also in EMEA and APAC (considerate share of $INFN sales).\n\n**Conclusion  & current stock development**  \nAs the Goldman article at the top also mentions, $INFN has had negative cash flows and could be about to turn that around due to a few of the points made here. They continue to pivot and move into lucrative positions in very interesting markets with bleeding-edge tech (such as their 800G network transformation technology currently being rolled out) that for many customers can offer a competitive advantage. Moreover, the company is a proven, reliable and innovative alternative to Huawei which is on its way out of especially the American market. This leaves masses of potential value to be captured and to grow with.\n\nSlowly moving on from covid, the economy is in need of new construction and creation meaning a huge rise in projects and therefore potential customers for $INFN. As Goldman agrees, this stock could be in for a rocket-ride in the first half of 2021 when their financials go from promising to delivering.\n\nWhen the Goldman article came out, the stock went from around $7 to $11 and is now hovering. This could easily prove to be the beginning of much more. The potential value of their market is way bigger than their $2.1B. When their cash flows improve in their statements in 2021 and they continue to capture new customers, especially from their weak competitor of Huawei, this stock will rocket as it should already. Its potential is simply skyhigh (and way higher than $2.1B.\n\n**TLDR**  \n$INFN has innovative tech in multiple lucrative markets and a brilliant market situation because of the growing public transportation markets and weakened competitors. Goldman believe they will rocket in 2021 because of cash flows going positive and so do I.
