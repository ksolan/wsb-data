{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "If you're like me you've been selling puts on the same old tickers while everyone else is mooning ahead due to SPACs so I wanna get in on the fun now. I found this list of new SPACs and I decided to summarize what they are about. Here we go:\n\n1) [Porch.com](https://Porch.com) AKA **PTAC** to **PRCH**\n\n[From an article](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/ptac-stock-13-things-to-know-about-proptech-and-the-porch-com-spac-merger/): \n\n>Essentially, [Porch.com](https://Porch.com) provides software to different insurance and moving businesses. In return, it gains access to the homebuyers those businesses are working with. From there, [Porch.com](https://Porch.com) can sell additional services like TV, internet and gutter cleaning. Perhaps most importantly, [Porch.com](https://Porch.com) represents yet another digital disruptor in the world of real estate.  \n>  \n>Additionally, Porch has struggled with profits. Its executive team says the deal will give them a blank slate and a chance to move past a history of losses.  \n>  \n>The company lost $49.9 million in 2019, $103.3 million in 2019 and is projecting $34 million in losses for 2020.  \n>  \n>However, [Porch.com](https://Porch.com) will have no debt when it comes public via PTAC stock.  \n>  \n>Also importantly, the company became profitable in June with $7 million in EBITDA.  \n>  \n>Additionally, it is eyeing $120 million in revenue in 2021.\n\nI give this one a **thumbs down**. This sounds like a lamer version of Zoom where you have a braindead one off software service platform that can only profit during an apocalyptic event. That being said I'm probably gonna sell a put or two against it for the lulz\n\n2) Butterfly Network: **LGVW** to **BFLY**\n\n[From an article](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/butterfly-network-a-global-leader-in-democratizing-medical-imaging-to-be-listed-on-nyse-through-a-merger-with-longview-acquisition-corp-301177892.html): \n\n>Butterfly Network's mission is to enable universal access to superior medical imaging, making high quality ultrasound affordable, easy-to-use, globally accessible and intelligently connected.  \n>  \n>Butterfly iQ is the only ultrasound transducer that can perform \"whole-body imaging\" with a single handheld probe using semiconductor technology. Connected to a mobile phone or tablet, it is powered by Butterfly's proprietary Ultrasound-on-Chip\u2122 technology and harnesses the advantages of AI to deliver advanced imaging that we believe is easy-to-use, improves patient outcomes and lowers cost of care.\n\nI give this one a **thumbs up**. This sounds like a healthcare unicorn stock and anyone who knows about the healthcare sector knows that they jizz all over their special snowflake stocks like this one. Plus apparently bill gates invested in it. Do you think bill gates would ever let his investment thesis be wrong? If citron wrote a bearish research thesis on them then they'd all end up hanging themselves by paper thin sheets with a loaded gun smuggled in the cell and excessive bruise marks if you catch my drift. If you sell a share he will find you and send you to the place where the sun don't shine. \n\nSo yeah shit is gonna moon\n\n3) Ouster: Aka **CLA** to **Oust**\n\n[From an article](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/cla-stock-colonnade-acquisition-corp-soars-on-ouster-spac-merger-news/): \n\n>Ouster is a creator of lidar systems that was founded in 2015.  \n>  \n>The company\u2019s lidar cameras are used in several industries.  \n>  \n>Among these are the \u201cindustrial automation, smart infrastructure, robotics, and automotive industries.\u201d\n\n[Here's a better article I recommend reading](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201222005187/en/Ouster-a-Leading-Provider-of-High-Performance-Digital-Lidar-Sensors-to-Combine-With-Colonnade-Acquisition-Corp.-to-Accelerate-Digital-Lidar-Adoption-in-Industrial-Smart-Infrastructure-Robotics-and-Automotive-Markets).\n\nSo at first I thought this one was a dud since who the heck knows what Lidar cameras are. But apparently they are used in every application which requires light and motion sensing which is well literally all of them and going to grow even more as we automate our society further. This stock's got me moister than an ouster So yeah **buy buy buy**\n\n**4)** Neurox Aka **BRPA** \n\n[From an article](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/brpa-stock-14-things-to-know-about-big-rock-partners-and-the-neurorx-spac-merger/): \n\n>NeuroRx is a clinical-stage small molecule pharmaceutical company.  \n>  \n>Investors should also note that it specializes in treatments for both Covid-19 and bipolar depression.  \n>  \n>Well, the two candidates that NeuroRx focuses on are rather appealing. The first is Zyesami, a drug the company is studying for coronavirus-related respiratory failure. As we continue to hear more about the worsening Covid-19 pandemic, BRPA stock represents a way to get in on the ground floor of a potential treatment.  \n>  \n>Additionally, the second drug from NeuroRx is NRX-101. This second drug is for suicidal bipolar depression and PTSD. Another unfortunate aspect of Covid-19 is the spike in mental illness. Therefore, the NeuroRx SPAC merger represents two critical areas in pharmaceuticals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis might sound like a contrarian take but I'm actually a thumbs down on this one. It has upcoming catalysts but no one knows what they are and let's be honest does having two drugs in the pipeline justify this price point. There's plenty of stocks like this one with promising drugs but they trade in the sub 5$ range, not 28$. Plus you can't even trade options on it.
