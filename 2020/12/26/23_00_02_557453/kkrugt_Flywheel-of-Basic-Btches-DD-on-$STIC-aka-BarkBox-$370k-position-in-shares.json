There is a new public post with the #BarkBox tag EVERY SINGLE MINUTE:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/kkrugt/video/ljf205se2m761/player\n\nAnd this is only PUBLIC posts, where most Instagram posts are private. This explains how they grew to 1 million users so quickly. For you retards, let me draw this flywheel for you:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/agsz39sr2m761.png?width=978&format=png&auto=webp&s=7873fbcd200f55e338d76ffab36e63dac8868ff8\n\nTo be clear, my investment thesis here is not that this company is not valued properly compared to the likes of CHWY. In fact:\n\n* Chewy has an annual revenue of 7 Billion, BarkBox has estimated annual revenue of 370 Million, which is roughly 19x smaller than Chewy's. \n* Chewy has a market cap of 43 Billion, BarkBox's is \\~2.9 Billion as of Friday's closing price, which is roughly 15x smaller than Chewys. \n\nSo you can see BarkBox is valued slightly higher actually. However, what we have is BarkBox's growth rate based on the BB flywheel, I can see them hitting 2 million subscribers, 4 million subscribers in the upcoming years. \n\n**Part 2 - Basic Bitches on RobinHood**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. People love spoiling their dogs, the few basic bitches I know that own BarkBox, look forward to it every month. Don't you friggin love giving a good gift? They have immense positive emotions attached to BarkBox.\n2. In 2020, almost every basic bitch has gotten Robinhood or Cash app this year and are trading stocks.\n3. What do you think will happen once they find out they can actually buy their favorite $BARK stock?? Just look at the becky stocks. Right now they don't know about $STIC, I think once word gets out, they will jump on.  \n \n\n**My Position**\n\nI basically invest in what's called the\u00a0[u/SIR\\_JACK\\_A\\_LOT](https://www.reddit.com/u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/)\u00a0ETF. I don't understand why some of y'all are giving him shit when all his picks have only gone up, and you could\u2019ve gotten in the day he posted for less than his entering cost!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/urmuveii2m761.png?width=2158&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd5a778a1dd61816fb8bf459f08370df49e55ce7\n\nAnyhow, I know I'm lucky in getting in before the 25% run up.
