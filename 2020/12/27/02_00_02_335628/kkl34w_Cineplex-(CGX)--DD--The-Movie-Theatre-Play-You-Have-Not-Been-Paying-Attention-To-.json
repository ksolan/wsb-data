Actually, it\u2019s really the only serious movie company in Canada, a North American country with 35 million people. Outside of movie theatre operations, CGX is involved in digital commerce and online e-sports platforms for competitive gamers. CGX was originally founded in 1912, headquartered in Toronto and essentially has a monopoly on the movie industry in Canada.\n\n**NOTE:**\n\n**For the RobinHood Crowd, see ticker CPXGF:**\n\n[**https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/cpxgf/**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/cpxgf/)\n\n**The company has three business segments:**\n\nFilm Entertainment and Content (including a fast growing and innovative streaming service that out-competes any of the American movie companies).\n\nMedia and Amusement\n\nLeisure\n\n**TLDR (sort of)**\n\nCineplex (CGX) is Canada\u2019s movie theatre company. With 164 locations across the country and 10 million accounts through its Scotiabank supporter SCENE program (there are only 35 million people in Canada), this really is Canada\u2019s movie theatre. It has next to no competition in Canada and its stock has suffered incredibly during COViD and is wildly undervalued.\n\nThe company\u2019s financials are sound, and it has completed several deals including arrangements with Scotiabank (one of Canada\u2019s largest bank) in relation to its customer loyalty program as well as Universal in USA to ensure Hollywood pipeline for new releases and its streaming service (one of the best in the USA/Canada) is successful. Both deals happened just in the fall.\n\n**Humans are social animals and will return in large numbers to the majestic experience of the movie theatre. This play has both short term and long-term upside \u2013 the upside in both cases is enormous. While risks exist here as with any deal, they are reasonable.**\n\nA simple, predictable, cash flow positive company that is wildly undervalued and about to pop on stimulus news (back to fair value) and even more in Q1-Q2 on re-opening and widespread vaccination.\n\nGiven the pent-up demand for social activities like this, the pent-up production supply in Hollywood, and the fact that many are sleeping on this play, a big swing anytime in the next couple of months is possible, making options attractive.\n\nShort term price target = $15 (+65% from current levels)\n\nIn the medium term = $30 (+230% from current levels)\n\n**Background Info on the Play**\n\nPre-COVID the stock was trading at around $35, doing very well for itself and had secured a deal for takeover with Cineworld (big UK company). When COVID hit, CGX, like all money theatres clearly took a hit. CGX took another hit in that Cineworld abandoned the deal in light of the pandemic.\n\nSince this time, the company has made several important decisions in dealing with COVID and planning for the future:\n\n***Quick on their feet in response to COVID:***\n\nThey were responsible during the lockdown in the spring as well as into the summer when they re-opened their doors to millions of movie-goers.\n\nThey quickly implemented new COViD-friendly practices and discounting for patrons. o They brought back a ton of old movie names like Jaws, Tarantino movies, etc.\n\nPrivate Venues - CGX began promotional offers for block bookings to use up the theatres, they were not screening movies in. For $120, 20 people could book a private party and choose from more than 1,000 movies to screen. These moves are anticipated to continue once the second wave of lockdowns lifts in early 2021.\n\nSale of their Headquarters to ensure further liquidity and the payment of debt\n\n***Negative Tailwinds leading to the undervalued stock price:***\n\n**1. COVID \u2013 Enough Said**\n\n**2. Cineworld**\n\nIn 2020, after covid hit, Regal owner Cineworld Group (UK) withdrew its planned $2.1 billion takeover of CGX. The deal would have led to one of the world's largest cinema companies with more than 11,200 screens globally. The Cineworld pullout has impacted the stock as well and again we think it\u2019s dropped too much even considering that failure. In July, CGX sued Cineworld for leaving the deal. We\u2019ll see what happens.\n\n**Specific Important Moves CGX has completed:**\n\n**Scotiabank Deal (Scotiabank is one of the nation\u2019s biggest banks) \u2013 December 2020 Deal**\n\nOn December 18th, CGX announced that they have entered into an agreement to enhance and expand the SCENE loyalty program by bringing together the full benefits of SCENE with Scotia Rewards, Scotiabank's flexible customer loyalty program. *In addition to providing SCENE's over 10 million members with the opportunity to redeem points for a variety of entertainment and dining options, beginning in the fall of 2021 members can look forward to redemption opportunities for a wide selection of brand-name merchandise from popular retailers.* Members will also have the opportunity to apply points as statement credits on certain Scotiabank products, as well as book flexible travel.\n\n**Online Streaming Platform Deal with Universal \u2013 November 2020 Deal**\n\nCineplex is also well positioned in terms of long-term investments it made in the online streaming sector. CGX, as a theatre operations business in Canada is better positioned then any of the American theatre companies, who have been slower to adapt to COViD (and in many cases did not have this streaming infrastructure in place prior to COVID as CGX did). *CGX and Universal Filmed Entertainment Group announced a multi-year agreement for theatrical exclusivity windows in the Canadian market.* This new dynamic window agreement between the two companies preserves the theatrical experience, while adapting to changing consumer behaviour, particularly as the world and the entertainment industry navigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\\*Similar to the agreements that Universal has established with other major exhibitors, coming into effect immediately, the agreement guarantees at least three full weekends (17 days) of theatrical exclusivity for all Universal Pictures and Focus Features theatrical releases, at which point the studio will have the option to make its titles available across premium video on demand (PVOD) platforms, including the Cineplex Store. Under the terms of the deal, any title that has a North American opening weekend box office of $50 million or more, including franchise titles, will play exclusively in theatres for at least five full weekends (31 days) before the title can be made available on PVOD.\n\n**Financials**\n\nOn review of the companies 2020 Q3 financial report and on review of the balance sheet, CGX is not poorly position considering its sector, the pandemic, and the monopoly it holds in Canada.\n\nThe *current ratio* (ratio measuring assets to liabilities) for the company is around 0.45-.50. For reference, JPMs is 0.88. Textbooks report 2.0 or higher as a strong ratio. Movies and banks are different entities for sure. But context matters.\n\nAs of Q3 2020, Cineplex had US$350 million in outstanding debt on its balance sheet and a monthly cash burn rate at around US$15 million to remain in operation. The company has a lot of property to play with if need be. It will utilize the federal refund as well as rent forgiveness programs during COVID to manager operating expenses.\n\n**Bull Case for the Future**\n\nUltimately, we all know that several sectors have been hardest hit by this pandemic.\n\nMany will not be a priority for government support or bailout. While this is sad for the economy, it also represents an incredible buying opportunity for those with some tolerance for volatility. Based on the analysis here, CGX is trading at an incredibly high discount when you take into account the balance sheet and a reasonable look to the future. **One thing to keep in mind here is the difference between the American and Canadian perspective on funding.**\n\n*As mentioned elsewhere in the DD, CGX has the ability to receive government money and incentives. The Canadian gov is super liberal and would never let this flag ship die.*\n\n**A few key points and some speculation to consider:**\n\nThe pandemic will come to a close. Companies as big as CGX who have not become insolvent thus far, will soldier on through the winter if their management makes the right moves. CGX has an exceptional management team.\n\n***The in-person movie theatre experience is going to come back in a momentous way. Humans are social animals and there are few activities as gratifying to us as going to the movies with friends and family and loved ones. We make cherish memories with this sort of activity, its fun and it has an intrinsic value and purpose in our society.***\n\nThere is pent up demand for spending of all kinds. This isn\u2019t limited to people going to the mall. They will flock to the theatres when this is all over as well. The mall and theatre stocks will be the last to bounce on the end of the pandemic news. Even more than airlines (because the GOV knows it can\u2019t let them die).\n\nPent up demand for traditional consumerism is matched by the pent-up supply Hollywood has to offer. While production has slowed down in tangible ways, screenwriting etc, has not. How many scripts and plans were made during covid? The floodgates here are going to open. COVID 19 as a sub-genre in film is something that we will come to appreciate in the years to come.\n\n***\\*\\*As the big player in Canada, CGX will be in a position to buy out any of the remaining small movie companies in Canada as we emerge from COVID and its financials improve.***\n\n**Price Targets**\n\nThis is highly speculative. The company trades at $9 presently. Pre-pandemic is traded at around $35.\n\nIts % in terms of asset/liability does not justify this stock price. Its fair value is somewhere in the mid to high teens right now, all things considered. *It traded at around $15 for the majority of the pandemic, which reflects this well.*\n\nAs hysteria lessons and as theatres re-open, this stock is set to move a lot. It has been hit very hard by the pandemic, the closing and failings of huge American theatre companies and the controversy over the Cineworld deal.\n\nShort term price target in the next few months will likely mimic where it was during the lockdowns at $15 (**+65% from current levels**).\n\nIn the medium term as things get back to normal heading into Q3-Q4 of 2021 and into 2022 this stock is positioned to move back to $30 (**+230% from current levels**)\n\n***\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Ultimately, the fact CGX has struck deals with BOTH Scotiabank and Universal in the last 60 days speaks to its agility and positioning in this hellish climate.***\n\n**Resources:**\n\nCineplex sale of head office: [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/cineplex-sells-toronto-head-office-232303901.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/cineplex-sells-toronto-head-office-232303901.html)\n\nCineworld Lawsuit: [https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cineplex-cineworld-1.5638757](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cineplex-cineworld-1.5638757) [https://globalnews.ca/news/7137630/cineplex-sues-cineworld/](https://globalnews.ca/news/7137630/cineplex-sues-cineworld/) [https://globalnews.ca/news/7061434/cineplex-cineworld-takeover-deal/](https://globalnews.ca/news/7061434/cineplex-cineworld-takeover-deal/)\n\nCGX Investor Relations: [http://ir.cineplex.com/?cmpid=FooterEN\\_tsx-cgx](http://ir.cineplex.com/?cmpid=FooterEN_tsx-cgx)\n\nCGX Annual Reports: [http://ir.cineplex.com/reportsandfilings/AnnualQuarterlyReports](http://ir.cineplex.com/reportsandfilings/AnnualQuarterlyReports)\n\nUniversal Deal: [https://variety.com/2020/film/news/universal-canada-cineplex-early-vod-1234836476/](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/universal-canada-cineplex-early-vod-1234836476/)\n\nScotiabank Deal: [https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/scotiabank-and-cineplex-announce-enhancements-to-the-scene-loyalty-program-883358115.html](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/scotiabank-and-cineplex-announce-enhancements-to-the-scene-loyalty-program-883358115.html)\n\n[https://www.narcity.com/en-ca/news/scene-card-will-be-going-through-changes-in-2021-but-your-points-are-safe](https://www.narcity.com/en-ca/news/scene-card-will-be-going-through-changes-in-2021-but-your-points-are-safe)\n\n**From the Q3 Report:**\n\n\u201cWhen I look back at the past eight months, I am extremely proud of our team\u2019s ability and focus in this environment and everything we have accomplished. **We have fortified the financial position of our company, raised the necessary funds to extend our financial runway and developed the \u2018gold standard\u2019 in health and safety protocols to safely welcome guests back.** We have worked hard to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business\u2026and we will continue to do so.\u201d\n\n\\- Ellis Jacob, CEO and President\n\n**Positions**\n\n\\~3500 commons at average of \\~$9\n\n**A fascinating play not without risk but with some very serious upside!
