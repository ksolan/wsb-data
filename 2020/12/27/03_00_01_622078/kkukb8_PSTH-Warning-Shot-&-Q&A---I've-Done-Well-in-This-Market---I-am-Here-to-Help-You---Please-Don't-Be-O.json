I have my positions locked in already. I have dramatically dramatically changed a huge portfolio around to dump the majority of my capital into this stock. I am holding it for 12 mo at a minimum (likely at least 40% until retirement) and have made appropriate lifestyle modifications to plan for that outcome, even in this crazy market.\n\nI am just convinced that this stock is not being publicized for some sinister reason.

Its something, some say, rivals the likes of which we haven't seen.**\n\n**PSTH PLAY**\n\nPSTH warrants have a strike price of $23 and every 9 shares you own now pre-merger allows you to buy 2 additional shares post merger close at a price of $23 per share. AKA TONTINE.\n\nRight now $PSTH is $3.03 above the strike price of $23 at $26.03.\n\n**So for the price of 9 shares today ($234.27) and buying 2 additional shares at the Strike of $23, you will own 11 shares in the future which means your average cost is actually (($234.27+46)/11 = $25.47 (TONTINE).**\n\nTargets really ultimately don't matter for us. **Bloomberg, amazing. In-n-Out, wonderful. Stripe, holy shit. SpaceX, we are in a simulation and Elon Musk is the overlord, what the fuck is happening, omg we are going to mars.**\n\nRegardless of who Ackman picks up, you\u2019re essentially guaranteed to have a low entry price here and be in the money **bigly**.\n\n**TONTINE TRICKS: Oh and it\u2019s possible you can get 3/9 or 4/9 additional warrants for every 9 you own, thus bringing the average price DOWN EVEN FURTHER. The warrants are only given out for shareholders who hold through the merger and there is a set amount of them that go out to someone!**\n\n\\----\n\nOver the weekend a warm calm came over me. I feel I have investigated this play for months and I have learned a lot about investing and life in the process. Ultimately, I have only felt as sure about something as I did with Tesla in March of 2020 when the stock was trading at $385 before it split (equivalent of $77 today, with TSLA trading at $660). \n\n**I am envisioning a 250% gain in the next 4 months.**\n\n**Merry Christmas WSB!
