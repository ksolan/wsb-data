You said this in reference to OP's protective collar:\n\n>It\u2019s not a \u201cvery bearish\u201d position it\u2019s slightly bullish\n\nSelling calls and buying puts are BOTH bearish positions. Since you're so fond of Investopedia maybe you should look up what the fuck it actually means to sell a call and buy a put. Selling a call obligates you to sell shares, which isn't a fucking long/bullish position. Buying a put gives you the option to sell at the strike which again, isn't a fucking long position as you're hoping the stock goes lower than whatever it currently is. That's the entire point of buying a put - to short sell stock. And upon this moronic rock of yours, you've built your stupid ass debate with me. Let's continue, as I doubt you know there are 2 types of collars.\n\n- Bullish Collar: When you SELL a put and use the premium to BUY a call. (not what we're talking about here)\n- Bearish Collar/Protective Collar: When you SELL a call and use the premium to BUY a put.

It's a double short, so yes, it's very bearish.\n>>You\u2019re wrong. The max profit occurs at the strike of the short call. (you)\n\nYou jumped to max profit which is irrelevant to whether a position is bearish or bullish. Every position has a max profit point. If I buy a put there's a max profit point somewhere below where the stock is trading. And I already said you can be profitable by having your shares called away higher than whatever you paid for them, either with a short call or a collar, as long as the strike is above your cost basis, you can be profitable. But that doesn't make it a fucking bullish position. Do you understand yet?\n\nLet's say you have a $20 stock. You can either sell a $25 covered call for $2/share, or use the $2 to buy a put for further downside protection. If you sell the call now, and the price goes up to $24, that call is probably worth $4 now, so you're $200 underwater on your short call because the stock didn't move down, it went up. That doesn't mean you can't keep the original $200 premium and however much you make off the shares being called away at expiration. It means you can't exit your short position/buy your contract back without doing so at a loss, which is why that contract is seen as a loss by basically every trading app. It's simple. You sold something short, it's now worth more than what you sold it for. You would have to lose money to buy to close. I'm not talking about expiration to close.\n\nNow with the collar you take the premium and buy a put, so there is no credit or debit. So the best you can hope for is that your shares are called away at the strike price. Otherwise if it expires just below, you make and lose nothing. And if it falls into your put hedge, you'll still be at a loss since the put won't 100% cover all downside, but it covers most of it. So yes, max profit is at the strike. Can't make anything above it, can't make anything below it. But it is STILL a bearish position. The entire purpose of a protective collar is to hedge against downside risk.\n\n>I sell calls every week.\n\nThat doesn't mean you understand jack shit Mr. Investopedia.\n\n>This strategy is often used to hedge against the risk of loss on a long stock position\n>https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/08/protective-collar-bullish-collar.asp\n\nUsed to hedge a long position.
