I would never hold a stock when I'm -7/8% on the position from entry, its telling you that something is off. Maybe ur timing, maybe the overall market, doesnt matter what it is, it just matters that you get out and figure it out after. I normally take losses anywhere from 1-5%, depending on a variety of factors. Great example of how the \"level\" doesnt always work. Love that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for this week here is what I am looking at (I currently dont see a ton of set ups, that is information).\n\n1) PLTR @ 29<, this is the level, if you can watch the price action here, do it, it is volatile, but I think if it breaks thru this area it has a strong chance of moving closer to 40-45. Needs to see volume for me to have strong conviction. Also, im happy to get chopped up in here a few times (if thats what happens) just to catch a portion of the BO. I really like the risk reward at this level.\n\n2) DKNG @ 55<, similar to PLTR, getting tight and im trying to see if it will break out above that 55-56 area, I like the decreasing volume here in this tight little range, looks like it is coiled. We shall see though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth of these positions I would play smaller, not because they are volatile, but because I have a good year and Im not looking to \"press the gas\" right at the end. Im content. Im looking fwd to next year. Good luck everyone, and congrats on making it through 2020, a year most will never forget.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, constructive criticism always welcome and link to the charts below\n\n[https://twitter.com/TonyCharts/status/1343291034034384900](https://twitter.com/TonyCharts/status/1343291034034384900)", "author_fullname": "t2_s2rt9", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Week of Dec 28th Watchlist", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Technicals"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "technicals", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_klb1zs", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Technicals", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609130530.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Review from last weeks post</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kghdix/week_of_dec_21st_watchlist/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kghdix/week_of_dec_21st_watchlist/</a></p>\n\n<p>1) NET @ 84.50&lt;, closed @ 84.98, +1%&gt;</p>\n\n<p>2) EDIT @ 64.75&lt;, closed @ 83.53, +29%</p>\n\n<p>3) CRSR @ 40.40&lt;, closed at 36.35, -10%</p>\n\n<p>For CRSR, I took a loss on it.
