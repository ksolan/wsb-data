Twilio\u2019s value proposition comes from the building blocks available to developers who can use software to assimilate new customer-facing offerings within their applications. Some simple use cases include automatic text notifications for appointments and two-factor authentication for secure services such as WhatsApp. The Programmable communications cloud software is a set of tools that enables developers to embed voice, messaging, and video capabilities into their applications.
