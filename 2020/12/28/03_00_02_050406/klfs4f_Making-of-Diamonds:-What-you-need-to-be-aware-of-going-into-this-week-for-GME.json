{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**Making of diamonds.**\n\n**My Pt4 of DD is coming but I just want you guys to be aware of the following going into Monday December 28th.**\n\nIt is true that shorts have been bullying us left right and center. They\u2019ve been pushing us around for months. They\u2019ve been manipulating the stock to put downward pressure in every way they can.\n\nI got so fuckin tired of those using money/power to push little guys around, it compelled me to write my very first Reddit post about a move a bully made to push GME down. Shoutout to u/The_Bossss for spotting their next move too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But not every move of theirs sits in plain sight like this.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Ones who\u2019ve been keeping an eye on the price action would know this but Oct/Nov: all those \u2018sharp 5\\~10% rise\u2019 the first market hour followed by gradual decline throughout the day could have been them taking the steam out.  \nThink about it. After 20 days of you messaging your friends \u201coh shit GME is squeezing today!\u201d you start to fall into \u201cfuck it, I\u2019m wrong again, GME will never squeeze.\u201d  \n\n* It\u2019s also VERY possible, that they are amongst us, selling us believable stories like \u201cDecember 24th is going to squeeze because of A, B, and C.\u201d and feed us believable bullshit to:  \nA) to create disappointment again/take the steam out of us or  \nB) to scalp us on options (honestly these posts could also be written by just straight up scumbags amongst us for this purpose). Options that were $0.01 $0.02 a couple days prior as a result were $0.10, $0.15. Doesn\u2019t seem like much but we\u2019re talking easy 10 baggers and 7.5 baggers for these scalpers.  \nC) They genuinely believe it, but you need to be aware of A and B and take it with a grain of salt.  \n\n* It is possible that they bought leading up to earnings/ran the price up, only to dump to set the \u2018direction\u2019 and cause a bigger sell-off utilizing the paper handedness of WSB. Yes, missing revenue was missed by 9.73% and that\u2019s not good, but when their earnings are beaten by 38.5%, did it really warrant almost a 20% slide the next day?  \nAgain, this was likely due to FOMO and disappointment, but I want you to be aware of the possibility.\n\nSimilarly, they may have bought the past week only to cause a dip one of these days.\n\nThe moment you paperhand it, is the moment you accept defeat and let the bully have their way once again.\n\nLook around you, you got a whole gang of people on this sub alone that will never let it get so bad. Don\u2019t turn your back and cry away just because you got bitchslapped. They are laughing at you as you walk to the corner to cry.\n\n(This is where your and my interest conflicts because I just deposited more funds and I\u2019m hoping for a dip so whatever you do is fine by me.)\n\n**Don\u2019t be fooled/read Seeking Alpha/Motley Fool articles likely paid off by Melvin Capital to be written that says GME may crash and burn or whatever because, on the contrary:**\n\n* It is true that ICR now has GameStop under \u201cTechnology\u201d now and it is true that Eli and Peyton Manning are doing a Q&A at 5:30pm, which is just after Gamestop\u2019s presentation.  \nI really can\u2019t see how Eli and Peyton are there for any other company but Gamestop.  \nMaybe they\u2019re going to announce a development of light weight/portable/budget friendly Omni directional treadmill or maybe an ultra high end that can load resistance/move opposite direction to where you are going (think linebacker getting pushed?)  \n\u2013 look up OmniPad for example of light weight ones (these guys are working with Facebook now).  \nI will talk about this in my Pt 4 DD but this is the future of gaming, e-sports even conferences/trade shows and even ZOOM calls (think room-like 'depth' so different conversations don't end up over-running each other). This would be HUGE.\n* Maybe what's being announced is just a VR headset and the football aspect would be that you have to look around exactly like how the real quarterbacks do in a new game they're getting involved in.  \nHey maybe Eli and Peyton are not even there for Gamestop but guess what, at the very least, just like how it has us guessing, it\u2019s enough to make Melvin Capital\u2019s head start spinning wondering if they should trim their position just in case.  \nThey must have at the very least had an internal conflict/dialogue about their GME short position there by now.  \nThey can start closing any day now. My recommendation is that you don't try to time this. It can easily mean the difference between 10x baggers and 6x baggers.\n* It could also be possible that the \u2018beef\u2019 between Cohen and Sherman is not real.  \nLook at the wording of the letters, look at the changes that Gamestop has been making over the past few months on their website alone.  \nFor all we know, the 'weaknesses' are shown just to keep the shorts horny. They could be working together.\n* It is true that all shorts are under water currently and they are paying fees/interest on their position (I know this is so obvious/repeated many times, sorry)\n* Ryan Cohen bought at $16.00. He\u2019s not even sweating.  \nYou gotta wonder, how did he come to 12.9%? Is that his max? is that all he\u2019s got?  \nAs u/ronoron pointed out, Cohen is not even fuckin sweating.   \nHe\u2019s just trying to meme \u201cOVER 9000\u201d (holding 9,001,000 shares)\n* You also have to understand that in the world of high level execs/finance (and even politics), people all somehow know each other/are connected in a way.  \nThere is a criss cross web of connections. As much as they fuck us and swat at us like bugs, up there you can\u2019t be so rash.   \nCohen can\u2019t just come to the scene and instantly make the squeeze happen. He\u2019ll make enemies that way.   \nIt has to be done in a way where he\u2019s given so many warnings, given them so many exits along the way and made his intentions so clear all throughout.\n\nAlso, he\u2019s Canadian so he\u2019ll probably even say sorry as he makes the squeeze happens. Source: I am Canadian and I am sorry for the long DDs.\n\n**Armed with this information:**\n\nYou guys are not all delicate snowflakes anymore. You guys are all carbon atoms. Some of you guys who can take some heat will make out as carbon fibre which I\u2019ll still be proud of, but those who can take the real heat and real pressure will make out as diamonds.\n\nRemember, the squeeze is a war and the moment the 300\u2019s marching shield formation is formed and held. GME can see $300s.\n\nI will get to the boring math stuff one day of how I got to $103 minimum squeeze price and $326 on the upper end. I know my DDs are long, but fuck I know for sure I\u2019m gonna lose y'all on the math. \n\nSeeing how you guys handled the last round of puts, I think it might even go higher but we shall see.\n\nFor those like me who had/have to build everything from $0 and never got any inheritance/financial help, the squeeze can be the greatest transfer of wealth you will ever experience. This time, you'd take from the bully.\n\n**positions**:  Shares as well as options JAN 15 15C, 30C, APR 16 30C.
