Both companies are burning through cash faster than they are earning it, and opted to raise their next round of financing by engaging with a group of underwriters (Goldman, Merril, etc) to create a bunch of new shares and sell them - generally these shares are sold to institutional investors: hedge funds, pension funds, high net worth individuals,  and other 'smart money' pools of significant capital.

The end result being a process where Tutes are able to buy a stock at an IPO price that is significantly less than the price at which retail investors can buy.\n\nSNOW IPO price: $120.\nSNOW debut trading price: $245\n\nAI IPO price: $42\nAI debut trading price: $101\n\nOk, crazy, right?\nBut here's the thing, the 'analysts' and major publications that influence retail investment behaviour all supported these valuations as though they were justified by future growth expectations! All they talked about was the importance of data analytics and artificial intelligence. No hesitation, just pure unadulterated pump and hype.\n\nFunny thing is, SNOW and AI seem to be as closely aligned in terms of business model to PLTR as any other products/services I have researched. All 3 provide software services that allow large organizations to more effectively aggregate, visualize, and apply AI to large data sets for the ultimate purpose of making critical business decisions. \n\nBut here's the thing... when PLTR decided to float their stock on the public exchange via a direct listing, rather than through a typical IPO process, the Tutes got left out... and they were clearly pissed.\n\nThe number of disinformation articles I read that tried to paint Palantir as just a consultancy, with too much exposure to a particular political party or government contracts in general, or lack of profitability (despite being cash flow positive), was a clear relflection of the industry's attempt to punish and apply downward pressure on the PLTR share price.\n\nFunny thing is, we now know that many hedge funds have been loading up on PLTR while their media counterparts were depressing the share price. I expect we'll learn that more have been doing the same since then, and I suspect that many have been hoping to keep the share price as low as possible until the lockup period expires sometime in Feb/March.\n\nIt pretty ridiculous when an analyst like Barron's downgrades the stock rating while simultaneously invreasing their price target from just a month previous by nearly 50%.\n\nIt seems that almost everyday I read an article that chastises the retail investment market for pumping PLTR to a share price that equates to a 50x revenue multiple, yet they are ok with SNOW trading at a revenue multiple of over 175x, AI trading at over 90x. Meanwhile SNOW and AI generated revenue in the $250M ballpark in the last year, while PLTR posted over $1B.\n\nPLTR direct listed their shares on Sept 30, 2020 at $10/share, and unlike SNOW and AI, did not feel the need to raise amy funds in the process.\n\nHad PLTR gone public via a traditional IPO amd followed the trend of every other tech related stock to IPO this year, the IPO price may have started at $10 and inflated to an IPO price in the $20-30 range before debuting for retail trading in the $50-60 range.\n\nWith the IPO industry's promtional hype and backing, the stock likely goes up from there, or at least holds and pops on every new government contract headline.\n\nInstead, the Tutes played a game of disinformation - holding the price down below $10 for the first month of trading while quietly building their positions. But then the silent period expired, earnings were released, the cat got out of the bag, and even Shitron Tweets could only temporarily subdue the rally.\n\nIt seems like the only headwind in site is the lockup period.
