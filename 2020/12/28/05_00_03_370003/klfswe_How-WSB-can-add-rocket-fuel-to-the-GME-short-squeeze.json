{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I think by now everyone is very familiar with the prospective Gamestop short squeeze. We\u2019ve got some pretty major catalysts in the pipeline and if Melvin and the other retard short sellers don\u2019t arrange a private deal soon to unload their positions then they are royally fucked. This isn\u2019t news to anybody here. \n\nWhat I\u2019m going to outline here is how WSB can send this rocket out of the solar system. How do we do it? We do this the WSB way and buy FDs. I want you to buy the most retarded option contracts you can get your hands on, the higher the strike, the better. Why? Two words: Gamma squeeze.\n\nFor those of you who are unfamiliar with how delta and gamma works I will do my best to summarize here. Delta measures how much your option contract will increase in value (or decrease) for an associated change in the underlying share price. Gamma measures the rate of change in delta. So, when an option is far out of the money both delta and gamma are very low (ie incremental moves in share price have less impact on the option price) whereas when options get closer to the money delta and gamma increases. \n\nOkay cool.. but why does this matter? I\u2019ll tell you why. When you open an option position there is likely a market maker selling you that contract. When they sell you the contract they hedge their position. How? By buying delta amount of shares that underly your contract (ie if your option delta is 0.1 the MM buys 0.1*100=10 shares). When the delta of the option  goes up (due to an increase in share price) the MM has to adjust their hedge by purchasing more shares.\n\nNow, let\u2019s apply this to GameStop. Let\u2019s say you buy 10 of the Jan 35 calls tomorrow morning which currently have a delta of 0.1 - MM\u2019s buy 100 shares to hedge the position they sold you. Let\u2019s say the stars start to align this week and by Wednesday the share price is up to $30. You\u2019re loving life right now because you\u2019ve made a fuck ton of money, but what else is happening? The delta on your contracts is now 0.4 and MMs have had to buy an additional 300 shares to hedge your position. The higher the share price goes, the more MMs have to hedge gamma on your FDs and voila, we have a gamma squeeze. \n\nNow I know a lot of you on here aren\u2019t retarded enough to only buy FD\u2019s (although I respect all of you who do) and I have a solution for you. It\u2019s called the synthetic share (well a modified version of it but it works the same). Basically what you can do is sell a put at the money, let\u2019s say the 21 strike, and use that premium to buy multiple 35 calls. This way you can set your net investment to 0 and you\u2019re essentially multiplying your market impact when the short squeeze happens - and doing so without soaking all the premium.\n\nIt\u2019s about time that we go full retard on this and show those boomer fucks what we\u2019re truly capable of.
