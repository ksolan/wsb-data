{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Hello fellow autists, I once thought snapchat was a shitty company that would eventually die out once everyone outgrew the photo sending communicating app. But somehow the stock price has had great momentum and even though I am a user of the app I do not see how it could be a 75 billion dollar company. Then I decided to do my own research and see a company that could certainly be more and no one can do what they can do. \n\nFor boomers who don't know what snapchat is. It is a camera application that helps people to communicate through short videos and images known as a Snap. The Company provides Camera, Friends Page, Discover, Snap Map, Memories and Spectacles. Snapchat opens directly into the Camera, helping in creating a Snap and sending it to friends. It offers a range of creative tools that enables people to personalize and add content to their Snaps. Its chat services includes creating and watching stories, chatting with groups, making voice and video calls, and communicating through a range of stickers and Bitmojis. Memories enable users to create Snaps and stories from their saved snaps, as well as their camera roll. It also offers Spectacles, its sunglasses that make Snap. The Company's advertising products include Snap Ads and Sponsored Creative Tools, such as Sponsored Lenses and Sponsored Geofilters. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[App View on Home Screen](https://preview.redd.it/xu3l4fr9ss761.png?width=267&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4439b494a0c69401c54168db259fcabab425e1e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The different screens on the app ](https://preview.redd.it/s2hqqja8ss761.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=49ebfd663de32d3995f69127153a251dd22a5257)\n\nSnapchat is the #1 social media company from middle schoolers to millennials. Not everybody has Facebook, Instagram, or twitter. But in the younger age groups snapchat has become almost as common as a phone number and rather then asking for a phone number one may say \"Can I have your snap?\".  \n\nSnapchat also stands out from other social media companies because it is the best at monetizing its users. Snapchat does not make money from its users, but rather takes its large amount of users and their data and then presents it to companies who wish to advertise. On top of that, snapchat has stayed true to its users and is very receptive of what users have to say, using their feedback to consistently better the app. I have been a user of the app since 2013. \n\nBut going back to the main point of monetization because that's what you gambling addict fuckers love to know, snapchat has over one third of monetization of twitter and over one fifth of monetization of Facebook and Snapchat's growth outpaces them so much that it is not even close. Below is a table of snapchat growth just in the United State alone. Over half of the people from 12 years old to 34 years old have fucking snapchat and growth in users has grown about 5% a year and beats expectations consistently while twitter misses expectations every quarter and gets in trouble because so many users are inactive or fucking bots. But also going off twitter, Snapchat recently came with a deal connected to twitter so tweets can be directly taken from twitter and posted on snapchat. And the more integrated snapchat becomes in our society, the growth of users will only become more exponential. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.businessofapps.com\\/data\\/snapchat-statistics\\/](https://preview.redd.it/9rtvq7vews761.png?width=992&format=png&auto=webp&s=541e278b350392a6b8954c126ffa74e6e6aa9e1a)\n\n \n\nLong Term Bullish Case:\n\nSnap is winning with an \"unduplicated and hard-to-reach audience.\u201d And while Facebook is getting in trouble for monopolies, snapchat is coming right under our noses with the fact that they provide exposure to multiple, seemingly unstoppable forces: digital ad spending, mobile gaming and entertainment, and overall smartphone addiction which is only expected to grow and do not see any case where growth will be stopped anytime soon, throw in the coronavirus as a catapult that launches this stock to the moon.
