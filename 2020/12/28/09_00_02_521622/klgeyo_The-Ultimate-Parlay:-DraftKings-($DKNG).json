{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Here on a Sunday night to give you autists some time to cross-check my info, start your RH instant deposit, and let your wife's bf know you're coming back with a vengeance. Here's an in-depth analysis on DraftKings and how to maximize profits over the foreseeable future to squeeze this for every tendie we can. Now that many states face revenue shortfalls due to the coronavirus pandemic and wider budget deficits, there needs to be a push to fill that gap and nothing is better positioned than sports betting.\n\nAs you all know, $DKNG came to market through a SPAC merging with Diamond Eagle back in April, at the worst of the pandemic when live sports were dead and there was more uncertainty than ever for what was to come. Jason Robins, Draft Kings CEO, has balls of steel and knew that they needed to get to market quickly for a sports betting run-up the likes of which we've never seen. Sports are now on their way back, with a huge amount of positive catalysts coming up in the next few months to skyrocket this stock to the moon and beyond.\n\n# Management\n\nI want to clarify that a large amount of my conviction from this play comes from the incredible management team leading the company. CEO Jason Robins is a stand-up guy and has led the company through a huge amount of scrutiny since its founding in 2012. He comes from a data analytics background which could not be a better fit for the sports betting business. He prioritizes the high speed data that fuels the DraftKings platform as its most valuable asset and speaks often on the commitment his team has to ethical values and encouraging a trustworthy environment for its users to gamble their paychecks on the DraftKings platform.\n\nI've linked a great interview to get to know the CEO and give further insight into DraftKing's plans moving forward below and highly recommend anyone going in on this play give it a quick watch. Jason is optimistic about the future of state's legalizing mobile sports betting moving forward and says they will continue to invest boatloads of money into customer acquisition costs through TV ads and billboards on a state-by-state basis. Link: [https://youtu.be/2OVFB9piEC0](https://youtu.be/2OVFB9piEC0)\n\nAny of you who have come across DraftKings commercials, YouTube ads, billboards, know that their marketing is on point. This is a great play because DraftKing's expansion has occurred thus far on a state-by-state basis. This means that there's a large part of the nation (actually the majority) that is still ignorant to the sports betting wave that is coming in 2021. DraftKings is positioned extremely well to lead the way into the \\~25 states still waiting to pass the bill.\n\n# Legislation\n\nThe fact that the top 4 states in the country still have not legalized online sports betting presents a HUGE opportunity to ride this wave with little downside risk. Sports have already gone through the worst-case scenario during COVID shutdowns and survived\u2014now we\u2019ve got a great amount of positive catalysts coming up (NBA season, March madness, Super Bowl, etc.) that the general population is begging for some action on, paired with more money in their pocket from significantly less entertainment costs since the pandemic started.\n\nThe Wuhan Virus gave DraftKings a shot in the arm to streamline its way into most (if not all) of the remaining state's ballots during Q1 and Q2 due to the huge cut in tax revenues that the lockdowns caused across the country. Governor Cuomo of New York released a statement last week stating he is now considering the passing of mobile sports betting in order to raise the state's tax revenue during a time where Congress completely skipped them over in terms of providing aid through the stimmy. New York is a huge catalyst moving forward. In my opinion, this is a make or break for how things look for DraftKings moving forward, and will largely influence how other states react. Mobile sports betting scares states as it is new and so accessible, but if you do research into the Powerball and other loterry companies, it just took a push in the right direction for states to realize how much money they are leaving on the table by not participating in these emerging markets. Sports betting has already benefited the 9 states which passed the bill (NJ leading the way) and has NY as well as every other governor, feeling major FOMO.\n\nCurrent states where online (mobile) sports betting laws have passed:\n\n* New Jersey\n* West Virginia\n* Indiana\n* Pennsylvania\n* New Hampshire\n* Iowa\n* Colorado\n* Illinois\n* Tennessee\n\nSome of the reported revenues from sports betting:\n\n**New Jersey:** $931.6 million\n\n**Pennsylvania:** $491.9 million\n\n**Illinois:** $434 million\n\n**Indiana:** $250.8 million\n\n**Colorado:** $231.2 million\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[On May 14, 2018, the United States Supreme Court found the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act \\(PASPA\\), the federal law prohibiting states from authorizing sports betting, to be unconstitutional. It is now up to individual states to decide if they want to authorize and regulate sports betting in their state. Congress can also take action on the authorization and regulation of sports betting but has so far left it up to individual states.](https://preview.redd.it/dxnojqu80u761.png?width=2060&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc94391759232c4e1337d8af2b2cf1cfcb090141)\n\nAs you can see, states are cashing out on the mobile sports betting wave, with New Jersey leading the way and making a large part of that revenue from NY residents crossing state lines to get their gambling fix in. Gov. Cuomo has been opposed to legalizing sports betting in the past, calling it \"a violation of the constitution\"...buut that was before covid lockdowns and his state was drowning up to their neck in debt.\n\nDraftKings management issued extremely bullish guidance without even taking into account new states passing legislation. This is one of the things that I love about CEO Jason Robins that stood out to me in the hours of interviews/articles I\u2019ve looked over. This man is the pinnacle of **underpromising and over delivering**. The staff at Draft Kings are extremely customer centric and focused on strong ethics to help them provide a platform for sports aficionados to enhance their viewing experience.\u00a0\n\n# Data-Driven/Proprietary Tech Stack (the MOAT)\n\nLegislation aside, the other huge catalyst is DraftKing's unique approach to owning its own data and proprietary tech stack. I believe that this will be where DKNG separates itself from the competition that is rushing to this space and will give it the upper hand in acquiring, and retaining, a large percentage of new users across opening states.\n\n**From investor presentation:** *\"Upon close of the business combination, DraftKings will become the only vertically-integrated pure-play sports betting and online gaming company based in the United States. Through the business combination, DraftKings expects to realize synergies by transitioning its risk and trading sports betting platform to SBTech\u2019s, instead of relying on a third-party platform. In addition to reducing costs, DraftKings will control its backend system and product roadmap, differentiating the company from other U.S. operators and giving it the ability to tailor its sports betting product to U.S. sports and users.\"*\n\n*\"SBTech is a global leader in omni-channel sports betting and gaming, with more than 1,200 employees in 10 offices worldwide. Since 2007, the group has developed the industry\u2019s most powerful online sports betting and casino platform, serving licensees in more than 15 regulated territories. SBTech\u2019s clients include many of the world\u2019s premier betting and gaming operators, state lotteries, land-based casinos, horse racing companies, and iGaming start-ups. The group supplies highly flexible betting and gaming solutions to clients looking for exceptional configurability and the quickest route to market, complemented by proven business intelligence and reporting capabilities. The SBTech offering includes its seamless sportsbook, Chameleon360 iGaming platform, managed services, on-property sportsbook and omni-channel solutions that provide players with constant access to sports and casino products across all online, mobile and retail channels. Supported by unrivaled expertise in trading and risk management, acquisition and CRM, and the highest standards of regulatory compliance, SBTech\u2019s partners consistently achieve rapid growth, enhanced brand loyalty and record revenues.\"*\n\nDraftKings prioritized **OWNING** their own backend technology via this merger with SBTech, making them the first, and only company in this space to own their risk and trading platform. This gives DraftKings a *huge* edge to the rest of the market. It forked up the cash to keep everything in house not only to provide a better customer experience, but also to widen the moat against competitors as new states come onboard. The key here is to clarify that DraftKings and SBTech combined to be the only player in the market with 100% vertical integration and control of their own backend. Jason Robins and the rest of the management team are placing their efforts on having the best technology and the best product and really going all in on owning the U.S. landscape opening up, with as little need for cross-platform interaction as possible.\n\nThis acquisition of SBTech was a complete game changer because it allowed them to be independent from paying revenue share to a third-party for betting lines and risk management services.\n\n**Clarification: no other sports betting/fantasy sports/casino company currently has 100% vertical integration on the level that DraftKings has established.**\n\n# iGaming Boom\n\nThis is where the market is missing the mark. Take the time to read over analyst reports, news articles, and interviews and you'll quickly notice 99% of the general market is completely glazing over DraftKing's iGaming sector. This industry has been a CA$H COW in Europe for awhile now, and is only getting started in the United States. Out of the companies that occupy this space, DraftKings is the only one to create one synergistic platform for Fantasy sports/Sportsbook/iGaming. This will be a huge value proposition that will ultimately rocket DraftKings to the top of the gaming market and solidify it as THE gaming powerhouse moving forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The infrastructure driving DraftKing's products and Tech \\(all in one platform\\)](https://preview.redd.it/t7x2af1k0u761.png?width=2156&format=png&auto=webp&s=8630f1eb26f047e004675572a4288b8eb183f9e2)\n\nAnyone that's watched the run of Skillz and the hype pushing PaySafe, knows how much anticipation there is for iGaming to become the new norm in the world of gambling. DraftKings has emerged as the market leader in each state they've launched in, and continue to gain more and more market share. Once new users get introduced to their platform, the cross-selling opportunity is limitless and creates an extremely sticky customer acquisition cycle.\n\nCompetitors like Penn and MGM are dinosaurs in this space and have been playing catch-up to DraftKings since 2012. The new age of gamblers don't want to drive to a physical casino location or buy a home desktop to gamble. Everything will be mobile and run in real-time. DraftKings has been building an incredible live-sports ecosystem (first to market) and innovates the possibilities of what you can bet on a daily basis. Just download the app for yourself and do some exploring. I believe this is going to boom in the TikTok/millennial crowd as more states start to hop onboard.\n\n# 2021 Projections\n\nPulled from the investor presentation, $DKNG has smashed every one of their 2020 assumptions listed below. For any stats guys out there, I would love to see some models at how much of this market is still up for grabs. DraftKings has positioned themselves to be at the head of this movement, and I believe that 2021 will be the year we really see them take off into triple digits share prices.\n\nThe catalysts are there, and the market is ripe for the taking. Their projections are extremely conservative and management lets the numbers do the talking. In my opinion, this is a bet on the management putting the dots together to EXECUTE as state legislation starts to go their way, once NY happens this shift will occur *rapidly.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.sec.gov\\/Archives\\/edgar\\/data\\/1772757\\/000110465920032214\\/tm2012476d1\\_425.htm](https://preview.redd.it/fci6corp0u761.png?width=2302&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a44dc5ecd56485439611c32db456b72d0664c49)\n\nThe management is incredible and truly displays a vision for wanting to prop up shareholder value in the long-term through valuable data, a fully integrated platform, and aggressive customer acquisition to take control of this market as states realize the economic deficits which they are facing going into a new year. This along with the unprecedented hype that is going to be involved with sports events this year, will skyrocket DraftKings to new heights.\n\nThis is not a bet on sports betting alone, it is a play on a data-heavy and analytically driven behemoth, with strategic partnerships (league, team, and celebrity partnerships) and one of the most aggressive marketing strategies I have ever laid eyes on. The stock soared earlier this years upon news of the Michael Jordan partnership ([https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/02/investing/draftkings-michael-jordan-deal/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/02/investing/draftkings-michael-jordan-deal/index.html)) and there is many, many more big moves in the pipeline.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nLong-term I am extremely bullish on people wanting risk to make up a daily part of their lives. The psychology of sports betting resembles that of the lottery and is becoming a must-have for people to have the choice to place bets from the convenience of their mobile phones. We are moving into a future where if risk and leverage are not involved, people will have little interest in dedicating their time to things. This shift can be seen with the boom in retail options trading (shoutout wsb gang) and will have a similar effect in sports, iGaming, and random prop bets/surveys that Draft Kings is innovating heavily in. This is not to mention the infrastructure that DKNG is continuing to build out to rival that of Europe in terms of live sports betting (which makes up three quarters of revenue for online sports books in the UK) and expanding their horizons to lesser betted on sports such as tennis, golf, soccer, etc.\n\nIf you've gotten this far, congrats you're just a few steps away from striking gold. Any feedback, comments, rebuttals, bear scenarios, etc. please comment. Good luck.\n\n# Positions\n\n**$70c 1/21/22**\n\n**$90c 1/20/23**\n\n[\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Bet at your own risk

This is a great play because DraftKing&#39;s expansion has occurred thus far on a state-by-state basis. This means that there&#39;s a large part of the nation (actually the majority) that is still ignorant to the sports betting wave that is coming in 2021. DraftKings is positioned extremely well to lead the way into the ~25 states still waiting to pass the bill.</p>\n\n<h1>Legislation</h1>\n\n<p>The fact that the top 4 states in the country still have not legalized online sports betting presents a HUGE opportunity to ride this wave with little downside risk. Sports have already gone through the worst-case scenario during COVID shutdowns and survived\u2014now we\u2019ve got a great amount of positive catalysts coming up (NBA season, March madness, Super Bowl, etc.) that the general population is begging for some action on, paired with more money in their pocket from significantly less entertainment costs since the pandemic started.</p>\n\n<p>The Wuhan Virus gave DraftKings a shot in the arm to streamline its way into most (if not all) of the remaining state&#39;s ballots during Q1 and Q2 due to the huge cut in tax revenues that the lockdowns caused across the country. Governor Cuomo of New York released a statement last week stating he is now considering the passing of mobile sports betting in order to raise the state&#39;s tax revenue during a time where Congress completely skipped them over in terms of providing aid through the stimmy. New York is a huge catalyst moving forward. In my opinion, this is a make or break for how things look for DraftKings moving forward, and will largely influence how other states react. Mobile sports betting scares states as it is new and so accessible, but if you do research into the Powerball and other loterry companies, it just took a push in the right direction for states to realize how much money they are leaving on the table by not participating in these emerging markets. Sports betting has already benefited the 9 states which passed the bill (NJ leading the way) and has NY as well as every other governor, feeling major FOMO.</p>\n\n<p>Current states where online (mobile) sports betting laws have passed:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>New Jersey</li>\n<li>West Virginia</li>\n<li>Indiana</li>\n<li>Pennsylvania</li>\n<li>New Hampshire</li>\n<li>Iowa</li>\n<li>Colorado</li>\n<li>Illinois</li>\n<li>Tennessee</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some of the reported revenues from sports betting:</p>\n\n<p><strong>New Jersey:</strong> $931.6 million</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> $491.9 million</p>\n\n<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> $434 million</p>\n\n<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> $250.8 million</p>\n\n<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> $231.2 million</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dxnojqu80u761.png?width=2060&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc94391759232c4e1337d8af2b2cf1cfcb090141\">On May 14, 2018, the United States Supreme Court found the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), the federal law prohibiting states from authorizing sports betting, to be unconstitutional. It is now up to individual states to decide if they want to authorize and regulate sports betting in their state. Congress can also take action on the authorization and regulation of sports betting but has so far left it up to individual states.</a></p>\n\n<p>As you can see, states are cashing out on the mobile sports betting wave, with New Jersey leading the way and making a large part of that revenue from NY residents crossing state lines to get their gambling fix in. Gov. Cuomo has been opposed to legalizing sports betting in the past, calling it &quot;a violation of the constitution&quot;...buut that was before covid lockdowns and his state was drowning up to their neck in debt.</p>\n\n<p>DraftKings management issued extremely bullish guidance without even taking into account new states passing legislation. This is one of the things that I love about CEO Jason Robins that stood out to me in the hours of interviews/articles I\u2019ve looked over. This man is the pinnacle of <strong>underpromising and over delivering</strong>. The staff at Draft Kings are extremely customer centric and focused on strong ethics to help them provide a platform for sports aficionados to enhance their viewing experience.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h1>Data-Driven/Proprietary Tech Stack (the MOAT)</h1>\n\n<p>Legislation aside, the other huge catalyst is DraftKing&#39;s unique approach to owning its own data and proprietary tech stack. I believe that this will be where DKNG separates itself from the competition that is rushing to this space and will give it the upper hand in acquiring, and retaining, a large percentage of new users across opening states.</p>\n\n<p><strong>From investor presentation:</strong> <em>&quot;Upon close of the business combination, DraftKings will become the only vertically-integrated pure-play sports betting and online gaming company based in the United States. Through the business combination, DraftKings expects to realize synergies by transitioning its risk and trading sports betting platform to SBTech\u2019s, instead of relying on a third-party platform. In addition to reducing costs, DraftKings will control its backend system and product roadmap, differentiating the company from other U.S. operators and giving it the ability to tailor its sports betting product to U.S. sports and users.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;SBTech is a global leader in omni-channel sports betting and gaming, with more than 1,200 employees in 10 offices worldwide. Since 2007, the group has developed the industry\u2019s most powerful online sports betting and casino platform, serving licensees in more than 15 regulated territories. SBTech\u2019s clients include many of the world\u2019s premier betting and gaming operators, state lotteries, land-based casinos, horse racing companies, and iGaming start-ups. The group supplies highly flexible betting and gaming solutions to clients looking for exceptional configurability and the quickest route to market, complemented by proven business intelligence and reporting capabilities. The SBTech offering includes its seamless sportsbook, Chameleon360 iGaming platform, managed services, on-property sportsbook and omni-channel solutions that provide players with constant access to sports and casino products across all online, mobile and retail channels. Supported by unrivaled expertise in trading and risk management, acquisition and CRM, and the highest standards of regulatory compliance, SBTech\u2019s partners consistently achieve rapid growth, enhanced brand loyalty and record revenues.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>DraftKings prioritized <strong>OWNING</strong> their own backend technology via this merger with SBTech, making them the first, and only company in this space to own their risk and trading platform. This gives DraftKings a <em>huge</em> edge to the rest of the market. It forked up the cash to keep everything in house not only to provide a better customer experience, but also to widen the moat against competitors as new states come onboard. The key here is to clarify that DraftKings and SBTech combined to be the only player in the market with 100% vertical integration and control of their own backend. Jason Robins and the rest of the management team are placing their efforts on having the best technology and the best product and really going all in on owning the U.S. landscape opening up, with as little need for cross-platform interaction as possible.</p>\n\n<p>This acquisition of SBTech was a complete game changer because it allowed them to be independent from paying revenue share to a third-party for betting lines and risk management services.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Clarification: no other sports betting/fantasy sports/casino company currently has 100% vertical integration on the level that DraftKings has established.</strong></p>\n\n<h1>iGaming Boom</h1>\n\n<p>This is where the market is missing the mark. Take the time to read over analyst reports, news articles, and interviews and you&#39;ll quickly notice 99% of the general market is completely glazing over DraftKing&#39;s iGaming sector. This industry has been a CA$H COW in Europe for awhile now, and is only getting started in the United States. Out of the companies that occupy this space, DraftKings is the only one to create one synergistic platform for Fantasy sports/Sportsbook/iGaming. This will be a huge value proposition that will ultimately rocket DraftKings to the top of the gaming market and solidify it as THE gaming powerhouse moving forward.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/t7x2af1k0u761.png?width=2156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8630f1eb26f047e004675572a4288b8eb183f9e2\">The infrastructure driving DraftKing&#39;s products and Tech (all in one platform)</a></p>\n\n<p>Anyone that&#39;s watched the run of Skillz and the hype pushing PaySafe, knows how much anticipation there is for iGaming to become the new norm in the world of gambling. DraftKings has emerged as the market leader in each state they&#39;ve launched in, and continue to gain more and more market share. Once new users get introduced to their platform, the cross-selling opportunity is limitless and creates an extremely sticky customer acquisition cycle.</p>\n\n<p>Competitors like Penn and MGM are dinosaurs in this space and have been playing catch-up to DraftKings since 2012. The new age of gamblers don&#39;t want to drive to a physical casino location or buy a home desktop to gamble. Everything will be mobile and run in real-time. DraftKings has been building an incredible live-sports ecosystem (first to market) and innovates the possibilities of what you can bet on a daily basis. Just download the app for yourself and do some exploring. I believe this is going to boom in the TikTok/millennial crowd as more states start to hop onboard.</p>\n\n<h1>2021 Projections</h1>\n\n<p>Pulled from the investor presentation, $DKNG has smashed every one of their 2020 assumptions listed below. For any stats guys out there, I would love to see some models at how much of this market is still up for grabs. DraftKings has positioned themselves to be at the head of this movement, and I believe that 2021 will be the year we really see them take off into triple digits share prices.</p>\n\n<p>The catalysts are there, and the market is ripe for the taking. Their projections are extremely conservative and management lets the numbers do the talking. In my opinion, this is a bet on the management putting the dots together to EXECUTE as state legislation starts to go their way, once NY happens this shift will occur <em>rapidly.</em></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fci6corp0u761.png?width=2302&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a44dc5ecd56485439611c32db456b72d0664c49\">https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1772757/000110465920032214/tm2012476d1_425.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>The management is incredible and truly displays a vision for wanting to prop up shareholder value in the long-term through valuable data, a fully integrated platform, and aggressive customer acquisition to take control of this market as states realize the economic deficits which they are facing going into a new year. This along with the unprecedented hype that is going to be involved with sports events this year, will skyrocket DraftKings to new heights.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a bet on sports betting alone, it is a play on a data-heavy and analytically driven behemoth, with strategic partnerships (league, team, and celebrity partnerships) and one of the most aggressive marketing strategies I have ever laid eyes on. The stock soared earlier this years upon news of the Michael Jordan partnership (<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/02/investing/draftkings-michael-jordan-deal/index.html\">https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/02/investing/draftkings-michael-jordan-deal/index.html</a>) and there is many, many more big moves in the pipeline.</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>Long-term I am extremely bullish on people wanting risk to make up a daily part of their lives. The psychology of sports betting resembles that of the lottery and is becoming a must-have for people to have the choice to place bets from the convenience of their mobile phones. We are moving into a future where if risk and leverage are not involved, people will have little interest in dedicating their time to things. This shift can be seen with the boom in retail options trading (shoutout wsb gang) and will have a similar effect in sports, iGaming, and random prop bets/surveys that Draft Kings is innovating heavily in. This is not to mention the infrastructure that DKNG is continuing to build out to rival that of Europe in terms of live sports betting (which makes up three quarters of revenue for online sports books in the UK) and expanding their horizons to lesser betted on sports such as tennis, golf, soccer, etc.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;ve gotten this far, congrats you&#39;re just a few steps away from striking gold. Any feedback, comments, rebuttals, bear scenarios, etc. please comment. Good luck.</p>\n\n<h1>Positions</h1>\n\n<p><strong>$70c 1/21/22</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>$90c 1/20/23</strong></p>\n\n<p><a
