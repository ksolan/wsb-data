Let\u2019s talk quickly about that and what were the latest news over the weekend**\n\n**\\~Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! I\u2019ll try to keep this as short as possible this time so that everyone can enjoy the holiday period as much as possible. So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Thursday, as we saw all 3 big indexes closing in the green with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/25nr29H) leading the way up .35%, but still lost ground for the week, down .14%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/zRsdNyJ) gaining .26% and finishing .38% up for the week and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/dr0WyrS) rising by .23% to close the short week of trading with a small gain of .1%.\n\nWe also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/pbKmzP9) dropping by more than 7% again to bring the volatility index down to the previous levels before the 30% [spike](https://ibb.co/hMjhQhH) we saw on Monday, as it has [dropped](https://ibb.co/kgPCkvn) almost 7 points after that spike.\n\nWe had a pretty much even market with just over 100 new highs as most [companies](https://ibb.co/SJCrVzX) traded below average volume on the short day, with 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/YbSSMt3) of the SP closing in the green, with Real Estate, Utilities & Technology leading the way while the Energy sector was the only one which lost ground Thursday, as Large-Cap growth companies were the [biggest](https://ibb.co/hYTsTLG) gainers, with small-caps finally underperforming after a great run in the past weeks.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/8MKCB9h) from Thursday, with most big tech Names gaining slightly, except Alibaba which plunged after China started the probe into the monopolistic practices of the company, while for the [week](https://ibb.co/f2NzK9d) we can see a pretty mixed stock market with big gains being made in the tech sector mostly, while big healthcare names, utilities and most of the Energy companies lost ground this week.\n\nWe also got a couple of economic numbers in the past few days, as holiday retail [sales](https://ibb.co/bB4XtGm) are estimated to be up 3% with online sales up almost 50% between the 11th of October and the 24th of December as e-commerce accounted for almost 20% of overall retail sales, up more than 6% since last year with big winners like Amazon, Wayfair an Etsy as well as big gains in the home improvement and home furniture sectors.\n\nThe other big number we received is more worrying, as investors have made a new high in margin debt, with over $700B in [margin](https://ibb.co/qYxdPtw) through November, I personally don\u2019t use margin even when buying leveraged products to avoid too much volatility in my portfolio.\n\nAnd one last report that we got from Reuters, is that they expect [China](https://ibb.co/LtKVg0T) to overtake the US and become the biggest economy by the end of the decade.\n\nWe only have a fed survey coming in [today](https://ibb.co/170H4tD), and this [week](https://ibb.co/Gsjqvf8) will be most of the same, with only some sprinkled numbers in the middle of the week, and not anything interesting to be reported as earnings go, before a closed day on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nAnd in some other stock market news, we saw Alibaba increasing the stock [buyback](https://ibb.co/SXgfNW8) plan to $10B but this wasn\u2019t enough to stop the bleeding for the company as this news came alongside the demands made by the regulators for [Ant](https://ibb.co/55zL5VK) Group to fix problems in some segments of their business before they can move on with the company going public.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES US](https://ibb.co/1XWqjyW) / [FUTURES INTL](https://ibb.co/D5TJ4Cs) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way, after President Trump finally signed the [stimulus](https://ibb.co/55v9p8L) deal last night, finally ending this long messy situation.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!
