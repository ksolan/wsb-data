It\u2019s used a lot of places for research because it's cheap and widely available... and that\u2019s the whole problem.

If you can target insertion of it \u201cin front of\u201d the gene you want to express (maybe genetic material encoding clotting factor in hemophilia) it ramps up expression of the subsequent gene. It doesn\u2019t really matter.
