The country could potentially have a similar impact on the Asian steel scrap market.\n\nBy comparison, the U.S., the world\u2019s largest single exporter of steel scrap, exported only 18 million tons in 2019 after four years of gradually rising volumes, much of which went to Turkey. Coincidentally, Turkey imported a similar 18.857 million tons in 2019, to the likely upper limit of potential Chinese imports next year.\n\nWould that be enough to move the market and raise global steel scrap prices?\n\n**Yes, almost certainly.**\n\nWith China now entering the market for shredded scrap - it is forecasted that prices could jump anywhere from $50-$100/ton in early January.\n\n**OK, so what does this mean for steel stocks and when are they going to reflect what's going on in the market?**\n\nI believe this will begin happening in early January when US manufacturers start reporting earnings and **GIVE STRONG GUIDANCE for 2021.**\n\n$CMC - reports 1/11\n\n$STLD - reports 1/20\n\n$NUE - reports 1/26\n\n$X - reports 1/28\n\n$CLF - reports 2/18\n\nThen we have:\n\n$MT - reports 2/11\n\n$VALE - reports 2/18\n\nWhy do I believe there will be surprise revenues, EPS and strong guidance?\n\nBecause of a few different factors:\n\n1. The previous quarters reported were some of the worst, with many of these steel companies being impacted by COVID - just like we have seen in this past earnings season for many non-steel companies - the bar was set very low - with the exception of $NUE and $CMC - their EPS came in above expectations - a sign of good things to come.\n2. Many mills were shut down or capacity was cut back - it takes time for all of this to come back on-line, this is one of the many reasons that demand is outpacing supply, utilization rates are growing daily.\n3. However, once mills get caught back up, which I believe based on today's order books, won't be until late summer, early fall - **the demand will remain HIGH due to low borrowing rates, infrastructure packages for countries around the world, the US housing market continuing to change and the renaissance of suburban/rural America - which will need commercial infrastructure to support the growing populations, re: schools, hospitals, roads, bridges, government buildings - police, fire, courts, etc.**\n4. Other countries are staring to become isolationist in their own domestic steel supply and due to skyrocketing costs, India and now Russia are both looking to ban the export of many products made in their own countries.\n\n**Which brings me to this:**\n\nAccording to Trading Economics website, **global steel prices have increased 15.39 per cent year-on-year, while iron ore prices are up 76 percent during the same period**.\n\n**In China\u2019s Dalian Exchange, iron ore prices have gained 50 percent this year compared to hot-rolled steel\u2019s 20 percent rise**.\n\nThe recent increase in steel prices is finally now starting to catch up with the increases in iron ore.\n\n**They are now being passed on pretty much dollar for dollar AND THEN SOME.**\n\nManufacturers that are vertically integrated like $VALE, $CLF, $CMC and $MT - **will most definitely benefit the most.**\n\nI am now adding **$CMC as an undervalued play on the back of rising steel prices.**\n\nMany don't know $CMC bought all of Gerdau's rebar mills in the United States in 2018.\n\n\"Vertically Integrated Business Model: CMC's vertically integrated business model and focus on pull-through volumes **benefits consistent capacity utilization and positions the company as a low cost producer. Approximately 50%-60% of scrap from CMC's recycling operations gets sold to CMC's mill operations**.\n\n**Additionally, nearly 100% of steel supply for its fabrication operations was sourced internally in fiscal 2020**. CMC's recycling facilities are often located in close proximity to mills, resulting in reduced transportation costs. Mills also have a steady and captive source of demand through internal shipments to fabrication facilities leading to consistent utilization rates across these segments.\n\nFitch believes the company's vertically integrated model also provides some margin resiliency through the cycle. Mills and fabrication operations tend to have lower margins in periods of rapidly increasing scrap prices, whereas recycling operations tend to perform well under the same conditions. The inverse correlation and timing difference of peak profitability during volatile scrap and rebar price environments across different segments helps provide some insulation against price volatility\"\n\n**Remember -** $CMC will be the first to report on 1/11.\n\nTheir last quarter was a surprise on earnings, with revenues being down due to COVID.\n\nI believe this next one will be a grand slam on revenue (due to higher steel prices and increased volumes) and EPS will be another surprise on the back of being able to benefit on the vertical integration of scrap and taking advantage of a rising market.\n\nTheir guidance will most likely be very solid, citing strong order books and demand.\n\nThis is also why I like $MT, $VALE and $CLF - vertically integrated suppliers will benefit the most in rising markets - top line and bottom line.\n\nI believe steel stocks will trade in sympathy with what happens on the 11th with CMC and then we have a rising tide reporting for the entire next month until $VALE reports on 2/18.\n\nAgain, I like $MT the best due to them being the largest manufacturer in the world, but the vertical integration of $CLF (who $MT has common stock in) $VALE and $CMC are all poised to take a ride on the material rocket that will be 2021.\n\nLastly, Schnitzer Steel will benefit from the skyrocketing scrap market. Low volume stock, but has the potential to double in short order.\n\nSorry for the delay in getting this out today - I actually have many jobs/hats I wear and this had to wait.\n\nWe are in a consolidation period - have some patience.\n\nIf you feel that you want to take profit and put it into something else that is more volatile with larger swings - do it.\n\nI'm confident we see breakouts to 2018 levels on steel stock prices, with potential for a 2008 like spike.\n\nGood Luck!", "author_fullname": "t2_10x7vki9", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Steel Update #4 - consolidation = consolidation $ 4 stocks that will benefit", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_km2p56", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 68, "total_awards_received": 4, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 68, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1609201395.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\u001b201222:2:1"}], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609229964.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Lots of nervous people out there today with shares/options of $VALE, $CLF, $X, $NUE, $STLD and $MT.</p>\n\n<p>Today was a down day for many steel stocks, while the greater market was up.</p>\n\n<p>Many of these stocks have been parabolic and were due for a &quot;cooling of period&quot; and some consolidation.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you look, many of the stocks I mentioned were trading at well below the 10-day Average Volume.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Low volume</strong> pullbacks occur when the price <strong>moves</strong> towards support levels on <strong>lower</strong> than average <strong>volume</strong>. <strong>Low volume</strong> pullbacks are often a sign of weak longs taking profit, but suggest that the long-term uptrend remains intact.
