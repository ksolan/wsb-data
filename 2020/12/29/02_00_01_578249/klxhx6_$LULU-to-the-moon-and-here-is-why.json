{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "What's up retards, long time lurker and full time tendiemaker here. LULU is going to go full meme stock in the next 6 months and here is why. \n\n# Technicals\n\nOkay let's get this out of the way for the idiots out there like me who thrive on Technical Analysis. Even the dumbest of us can see that LULU has been going straight up as far back as Robinhood allows you to go. It shows a clear reverse downtrend pattern, and is in the process of doing the double batman pattern. For you newbies out there, this means our trusty sidekick Robin(hood) is telling us to buy calls.\n\n# Fundamentals\n\nIf you are an even bigger bullshitter, you'll know that Technical Analysis is for people that use the stairs. If you park in the blue and use the easy access ramp, then I know you are like me and check out the Fundamentals. \n\n1. LULU has basically always had incredible earnings reports, constantly beating analyst expectations. Furthermore, their stock price continues to increase the following quarter after a strong earnings report. Guess what? Earlier this month, they BLASTED earnings, beating expectations. You'll notice that all of 2020, their stock price has gone down immediately after posting earnings, but then will shoot back up in no time. The price has been going down because LULU has not issued guidance, siting COVID as the reason for uncertainty. But EVERY time this happens, the stock goes down and EVERY time LULU proves investors wrong by keeping a strong supply chain. \n2. Don't believe me that LULU is a good buy? Those of you who have TDAmeritrade should check out the \"Fundamentals\" Tab under analysis. Analyst ratings are all on ACCUMULATE and BUY. \n3. How about Price Targets? Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, and Barclays all raised LULU's Price Targets this month, with Morgan Stanley joining them a few days later. The highest price target is by JPM at $442. LULU is trading at \\~$355 as I am writing this. And if you follow price targets closely, you should know that these big banks like to have conservative price targets so that they are more likely to hit their targets and don't look stupid to investors. If JPM is saying $442, what they really mean is $500+++\n4. Do you guys know the CEO, Calvin McDonald? This guy is an all star and everyone loves him. Since he became CEO in 2018, LULU has been going PARABOLIC. This guy is basically the Lisa Su of athleisure, and I know how you weebs love Su Bae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# DD\n\n1. Have you guys ever been inside a fucking Lululemon store? I went over the holidays to do some shopping with my tendies, and there was a huge ass line and stuff was flying off the shelves. I couldn't find half of the stuff in my size. I talked to the store associate and they said that they get inventory EVERY DAY, and that I could come back the next day. I did first thing in the morning and there was my size of stretchy chino pants for $128. Now think about it: does this sound like a company that has issues with supply chain or demand to you? Absolutely not. I guarantee their Q4 earnings are going to be insane.\n2. Who are LULU's customers? Rich girls and boys with daddy's money who want to spend $100 on a fucking shirt. These aren't people who are hurting from losing their robs, these are people who are cooped up indoors and want to online shop so that when this summer comes around and everyone has vaccines, they have a ton of new stretchy expensive athletic wear to show off to the world. All the rich people with their new pelotons want something to spend their money on, and it's Lululemon. \n3. Have you ever worn these pants? They are insanely comfy and I look good as hell. I'm gonna buy more, and I showed my friends and family and they are all going to get some too. My wife is even buying some for her boyfriend and getting the alterations done free in-store.\n\ntl;dr - LULU 6/18 C $540", "author_fullname": "t2_main3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "$LULU to the moon and here is why", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_klxhx6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 43, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 43, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1609185515.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609213690.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>What&#39;s up retards, long time lurker and full time tendiemaker here.
