With a population of nearly 15 million people, it is by far the largest market in Canada(currently accounts for 28.6% of national sales) and up until June only had 70 retail stores open. As of December 1st there were 255 retail stores open, with 106 of those store openings coming during this quarter, a **71%** increase from the previous Q.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Store Openings this Q](https://preview.redd.it/a3dgzwnzgy761.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=d814583986fb7625298fccb7acf7498c2e29664f)\n\n  \n\n**Canada Sales**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rybo0cz2hy761.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=afa860ae673e83298e217f4dafae906d704a0b2c\n\nHealth Canada releases sales data on the Canadian Recreational market every month, which effectively confirms that there is continued growth in the market. Sales increased in both September(2%) and October(5%) and I anticipate we see a larger jump in November due to a large amount of store openings in mid-October to early November. Aphria has shown its ability to continually grow with the Canadian market, as long as they maintain their industry leading market share in Canada we should see this trend continue.\n\n**Brand Success**\n\nKind recently published their brands of the year award, determined by over 150 budtenders in Canada. Each of Aphria\u2019s brands won an award, with the exception of B!NGO which launched in August. My focus on branding is specific to 3 product categories; Dried Flower, Vapes and Pre-Rolls, which make up **86%** of Canadian sales. The data below was collected using Headset, which tracks the top 10 selling products by category, updated weekly.  \n\n**Pre Rolls**\\- 12% of the Canadian Market and 12% of Aphria\u2019s Rec Revenues\n\n**Kind Award**: Indica Pre-Roll of the Year: *RIFF*\\- Subway Scientist\n\nAphria dominates the Pre-Roll market, their Jean Guy strain sat at #1 for the month of September and their Royal Highness strain took over the #1 spot for all of October and November. They boasted the top 6 best-selling products for September and maintained 4 of the top 5 spots for October and November. Aphria\u2019s brands were #1 in pre-rolled market share in Canada last Q, a trend that will continue into this Q.\n\n**Vapes**\\- 15% of the Canadian Market and 14% of Aphria\u2019s Rec Revenues\n\n**Kind Award**: Indica Cartridge of the Year: *Good Supply*\\- Purple Monkey \n\nSativa Cartridge of the Year: *Good Supply*\\- Tangie Kush\n\nHybrid Cartridge of the Year: *Good Supply*\\- Pineapple Express\n\nAnother category that Aphria dominates, their Blue Dream strain held the #1 spot for the month of September while their Pineapple Express strain held onto #1 for October and November. They held 3 of top 5 best-selling vapes for September and October, and 2 of the top 5 spots for November. They had 4 products in the Top 10 from October to November and a recent PR stated they held their #1 market share position in both Ontario and Alberta in the last 3 months, ending Oct 31. \n\n**Dried Flower**\\- 59% of Canadian Market and 58% of Aphria\u2019s Rec Revenues\n\n**Kind Award**: Craft Cannabis of the Year: *Broken Coast*\n\nCBD Brand of the Year: *Solei*\\- Free\n\nAphria has a strong presence in the Dried Flower market, with their Jean Guy strain being the #1 best-selling flower in October and November. They held 3 of the top 5 spots in September, 2 of the top 5 spots in October and 1 of the top 5 spots in November. At the end of August they launched their new discount brand B!NGO which targets the growing bulk-offering subcategory(15&28G offerings). This move immediately undercut all competitors by offering the cheapest large format options, with ounces as low as $4.18/G, all the while maintaining competitive prices with their *Good Supply, RIFF* and *Solei* products.  This will be this first quarter we see sales from these bulk offerings and its no doubt this move is intended to propel them from #2 in dried flower market share in Canada to #1. \n\n**Additional German Cannabis Revenue**\n\nIn early October Aphria made their first shipment of medical cannabis from their Canadian facility to Germany. This cannabis will be distributed through Germany by their pharmaceutical company CC Pharma, a leading distributor of pharmaceutical products, with more than 13,000 pharmacies in Germany and Europe. They also launched several new CBD wellness brands in Germany, CannRelief, Evoque and CannaPet. Products under the CannRelief brand consist of cosmetic oils, creams and supplements. Evoque provides natural and sustainable products, such as face creams and serums. CannaPet provides products designed to help with relaxation, relief and recovery of pets. All of these products are distributed through CC Pharma and will provide a new revenue stream for Aphria. \n\n**Speculative: MOON POTENTIAL**\n\n***Georgia Senate Runoff***\n\nThe most important vote thus far in the cannabis industry. If the Democrats sweep the Jan 5 senate run-off election, they would flip senate control. This would be the largest catalyst for US legalization we have seen, and the sector hype will be all you guys talk about. With a Democrat majority in the Senate, the MORE Act; which would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substance Act would see the senate floor and likely pass; the bills sponsor is Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. The SAFE Banking Act would also hit the senate floor and likely pass, allowing banks to serve the Cannabis industry. Most importantly would be full on federal legalization, while Biden has supported decriminalization, a senate & house majority and nearly 60% of adults supporting legalization could push him towards federal legalization. \n\n***Aphria-Tilray Merger, Sweetwater acquisition***\n\nAphria has made a big splash in the US space in recent weeks, with the acquisition of Sweetwater Brewing and more recently merging with Tilray. SweetWater is one of the largest independent craft brewers in the US with flagship 420 beverages and award-winning beers. Aphria will immediately be able to sell beverages under the Solei and RIFF brands in the US with SweetWater\u2019s distribution infrastructure, giving them a major entry into the beverage market. Tilray is a US based cannabis company, backed by WSB favourite Peter Thiel and a JV with alcohol giant Anheuser-Busch, but more famously known for its epic run to $300 in 2017. With a leading market share in Canada and a solid cash balance, they will be able to focus on the lucrative US market. Leveraging their connections with Anheuser-Busch, Peter Thiel and former CEO of WholeFoods Walter Robb makes them an attractive favourite among investors. The merger will effectively create the largest Cannabis company in the world, and both Aphria and Tilray are set to benefit if the democrats take control of the Senate on Jan 5.
