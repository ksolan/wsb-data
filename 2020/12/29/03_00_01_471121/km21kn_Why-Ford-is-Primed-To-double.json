{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": " There's alot of factors going for ford. I know its a boring ass boomer stock, but in a market overinflated nearly everywhere, Ford is being slept on. If you need a good place to park your 6 figure pay day from Tesla, Ford is the place to go. Here's why.\n\n1. Alot of old people died this year, so Ford will be paying out less in Pensions.\n\nCovid killed alot of old people. Giving all those workers 30k a year for life gets expensive. Luckily, alot of those crusty boomers died this year due to the coronavirus, and that'll help that bottom line so they won't have to keep paying crusty old people their checks for 30 years of employment. Pensions were a massive burden so this is a blessing in disguise.\n\n2. They got a new (competent) CEO and their restructuring plan is going well\n\nThey played it smart and basically cut production of all of their shitty vehicle lines. Now they took one from the Tesla and Apple playbook and they don't just release an abundance of shitstains with wheels, they did what they did with the Mach-e and the Bronco, and made super nice cars, made a show about it and hyped it up. Kinda like Elon did with the Cybertruck and Semi's and the Roadster and so forth. As of now they only produce their most popular and profitable cars, not shit like the ford Pinto.\n\nTheir Old CEO built furniture or some shit and went to the University of Michigan. The new guy went to Ivy league and literally worked his entire life in the Car industry.\n\n3. They are primed for an EV take-off.\n\nThey have their electric Vans fleet. They have the Mach-E coming in 2021. They have an all-electric F-150 which they have been hyping up big time. They also have a few other big players coming along with their already full hybrid lineup.\n\n4. Current Dividend yield is sitting at 7%.\n\nThey discontinued their dividend as of January due to the corona drop, which IS GOOD because theyre not wasting money on some boomer garbage no one cares about. That money just goes straight to R&D to get some sick new EV's out, and goes to your returns. If you buy stock, and hold it, and the dividend comes back, you can make 7% a year for life as well, if you need a place to park your 6 figure gains from the year.\n\n5. Literally tons of room to run.\n\nIt was at 90$ in the dot com bubble. The market cap is insanely low, so we can easily pump this up more. Options are cheap because there's no volatility, but pulling a tesla and buying up tons of options tricks the bots into buying all the stock up and all that.\n\n6. They have had several good quarters this year, meaning the restructuring is actually helping the EPS.\n\nThey are finally focusing on profitability and earnings growth instead of revenue and market share. Something like 25% ER growth in China as well.\n\n7. The boomers have a hard-on for it\n\nAll the boomers are raising the price on it and saying about how much they love the new restructuring and so forth. \"The only EV ill buy is GM and Ford\" etc etc. While boomers are idiots, they have alot of money, and love parking it in places like Ford. Get a hype train going on Ford, and the boomers will FLOCK to ford with their boomer money.\n\nPositions:\n\n2500 Shares\n\n100 Mar 19 2021 - 9$ strike", "author_fullname": "t2_9jmlziap", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Why Ford is Primed To double", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_km21kn", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609227822.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>There&#39;s alot of factors going for ford.
