{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Tl;dr Don't long underlying stock; if you're bullish on QS then buy calls to short squeeze, sell puts to collect very expensive premium.\n\nFirst off, if you're long QS stock on Robinhood, you're a moron flushing money down the toilet.\n\nWhy? Consider this: an ATM Feb put goes for around $50, call for $10 (300% vs. 70% IV). Meaning that a synthetic stock position (short put + long call), which has an identical payoff as a long underlying stock, gives a guaranteed $40 extra compared to a long underlying position. This is usually arbitraged away by the law of put-call parity: do a synthetic stock, then short underlying. Problem is, stock borrow rates are off the roof.\n\nQuick review of put-call parity, skip if you hate math: `C-P=F*S-K,` where C=call price, P=put price, S=stock price, K=strike price F = future value rate (based on risk-free interest). Using Feb 110 strike price, this gives us an implied future value at 78. Alternatively, we see that put price = call price at approximately 88 strike. Compare that to the $115 price as of writing. The way I interpret this is, even if you're bearish, the market has already priced in a drop to the 80s.\n\nCurrently the lending interest is 600%. Six hundred. Fucking. Percent. Seeing as Robinhood doesn't have a share lending program, and retail brokers that do have a lending program typically skim off 50% of interest earned, and considering the ability to construct a synthetic long position on a stock that doesn't pay dividends, buying the underlying rather than a synthetic position (or ya know, staying out entirely) is just plain dumb. Unless, of course, you can lend and your broker is paying you the 600% interest.\n\nIn fact, ATM puts are trading at 5x calls as of writing. If you want to break even if Feb expires at spot, which is the payoff of a long stock anyways, you could long 5 calls for every 1 put you short ATM, giving you a 5x payoff upside vs. a 1x payoff downside, rather than a 1:1 payoff of long stock. My options position (see below) has a similar payoff characteristic.\n\nOn the other hand, the more QS shares are held in Robinhood accounts, the shorter the supply of lendable shares, which increases short squeeze pressure due to the above. So the people who are holding QS but not lending them are collectively helping the squeeze. So hopefully this post doesn't reach enough people to hurt my position.\n\nAlso, with a 600% interest, consider the ease at which the shorts can be squeezed. Let's say their call is correct, that QS eventually goes down to $60, even $40. But let's say their timing is off, and that QS stays steady or increases for a while before crashing. The lending interest they need to pay forces them to buy more shares to cover, which also bids up share price.\n\nAnother point: when you buy calls, the market-maker on the other side of the trade must buy the underlying stock, which is known as Delta hedging. Only problem is, when stock moves up big, shorting calls = need to buy even more stock to remain Delta neutral. So you can imagine this positive feedback loop: the more QS goes up, the more market makers need to buy QS, further driving up demand and bidding up price. This phenomenon is called Gamma chase.\n\nAs long as these two short-term factors are driving demand, QS may continue to skyrocket. When the shorts have covered, lending rates are back to normal, and gamma shorts have closed their positions, it's time to wind down or get out entirely.\n\nFAQ: Aren't current QS valuations crazy high? Yes they absolutely fucking are. But if there's any lesson I've learned by staying on the sidelines watching TSLA go to the moon, it's that fundamentals hardly matters in our current market conditions. It's all supply and demand, based on hype. And I'd say the hype for QS may have only just begun.\n\nFAQ: Isn't QS just the next Nikola, doomed to fail because of an overhyped technology and sketchy leadership? Doubt it. I searched their employees on LinkedIn. A few of them are my classmates from engineering school. Jagdeep Singh is no Trevor Milton, he's been the founder and CEO of several legit tech companies in the past. And the technology is endorsed by well-respected Stanford engineering professors. Bill Gates and Volkswagen, the latter being the traditional car manufacturer that has made the most effort to catch up to Tesla in EVs, have major stakes too. It's not the next gravity-powered nonsense. So QS won't crash due to a NKLA-type scandal.\n\nThis doesn't mean a correction won't happen in the short term; in fact, I think it's the most likely case. But in the meantime, the stock can easily continue to skyrocket, allowing you to cash out your relatively cheap calls in the meantime.\n\nSo what's the strategy? I opened as many credit put spreads (Feb exp) until maximum notional at risk is around 10% of my entire portfolio value. Basically, you wanna short ATM/NTM put options (I like 40-60 delta) to collect maximum credit, but cover your downside by buying back an OTM put (I like 5-20 delta). I then use some of the proceeds to buy 16-40 delta call options, ranging from FDs to 1 or 2-months, up to 3% of my portfolio value. The idea of buying shorter-term calls is, I think the spike caused by short squeeze and gamma chase may be faster than the correction. The point at which I'll exit this trade is when lending interest is back to reasonable levels, i.e. when put-call parity starts to hold again. This is the point at which short squeeze has less pressure, the most likely point that allows this crazy bubble to deflate. Of course this may happen sooner, but that's why you cap the downside.\n\nCompared to my max loss, this position is giving me a 1 to 1 payoff at a +0.5std move, 5 to 1 at +1std, 50 to 1 at +2std.\n\nIt's pretty degenerate to bet on an obviously overvalued company to continue rising. So I wouldn't risk more than 15% of my portfolio value at a time on this position. Instead of letting your winners ride, I would cash out and rebalance whenever it moves in your favor. For example, on Monday I entered the above position when it opened at $75 (sadly, I didn't discover this trade before). By Tuesday it was trading at $115, I made a 150% profit and cashed out my newly ITM calls enough so that I was once again risking 10% max loss, and re-bought more OTM calls. So in the worst case scenario I'm still above breakeven with this trade overall.\n\nMaybe my very first WSB post will age poorly, and QS collapses soon after I post this. But I stand by this strategy, seeing as I'm already guaranteed to be above breakeven, despite having been very late to this party.", "author_fullname": "t2_9j3ve886", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Big Short Squeeze - QS", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Options"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "options", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_klui0h", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Options", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 31, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1609178992.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609204595.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Tl;dr Don&#39;t long underlying stock; if you&#39;re bullish on QS then buy calls to short squeeze, sell puts to collect very expensive premium.</p>\n\n<p>First off, if you&#39;re long QS stock on Robinhood, you&#39;re a moron flushing money down the toilet.</p>\n\n<p>Why?
