{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Hello fellow autists. This is the first DD I've posted here so please tell where I went full tard mode and fucked something up. If this breaks any rules I'm sorry and ill delete this post. \n\nNuScale Power has developed smaller, safer, cheaper, and more affordable nuclear reactors. In December of 2016 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved NuScales design of small module reactors (SMR's). NuScale was founded with the purpose of being able to construct next generation nuclear reactors in factories. \n\nThe major concern for nuclear power is safety. The 3 Mile Island incident, Chernobyl, and Fukushima all are severe push factors for communities to not invest billions in nuclear reactors. The last nuclear reactors was built in 2016, before that 1996. In 2019 there were 17 shutdown nuclear reactors in various stages of the expensive decommissioning process (this process can cost anywhere from 300 million to 5.6 billion). \n\nNuScale has come to resuscitate the need for nuclear reactors in a new fashion. Development and research of commercial reactors has largely stopped. Traditional reactors, which cost 7 to 9 billion to produce, make 1 gigawatt of energy (enough to power roughly 1 million homes). However, NuScale has taken a new approach. Their SMR's take up 1% of the space of traditional reactors but only produce 60 million megawatts. However, for 3 billion NuScale can construct 12 SMR's side by side. \n\nWhile in the commercial sector advancements for nuclear reactors has largely stopped, this is not true for the military. Since the 1960's the US Navy has sailed 1.7 million miles by nuclear powered ships without a single incident. France gets 75% of its power from nuclear reactors. NuScale represents the American response to commercial nuclear reactor advancements. \n\nNuScale has improved the safety of their SMR's by removing pumps, valves, and various moving parts and at the same time adding more safety mechanisms to prevent a meltdown (even if one of us retards was in control). Furthermore, they plan to construct their SMR's in factories and ship them to where they need to be reducing the cost. \nNuScale has spent 800 million, much of which comes from its main investor Fluor Corporation (FLR: NYSE). However, it also received 288 million from the Department of Energy to develop its designs. It also has its first customer in Idaho that wants NuScale to start construction on a reactor in 2023. \n\nThere are similar companies that are doing the same thing in Russia and China. America presses on to be the world leader compared to Russia and China, so this competition could lead to more investments into NuScale, especially from a pro near energy president such as Biden. \n\nFor no NuScale is private, but as Biden gets to set his climate change policies NuScale might look to go public to increase funding to expand. For now BHP is an investment that will flourish from not only nuclear energy expansion but also its various other mineral mining ventures. \n\nThis is probably too early to post as there is no talk of NuScale going public, but they are a company that I would keep an eye on over the years and invest in when they go public. \n\nPositions: \n55 BHP shares\n\nBut for more fun: 100 PLTR shares and 30 GME shares\n\nTLDR: No current plays, but watch when NuScale goes public. They make small modular nuclear reactors that can revatilizs nuclear energy in the US.
