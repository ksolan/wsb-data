He predicted that the trial would hit 50 cases sometime in between December 12th and December 20th.

Recently, the Novavax trial hit the threshold to unblind their participants. Unblinding means that they tell participants whether they had the real vaccine or the placebo. Basically, they hit enough cases which means they are either nearing or have completed collecting all their data and are currently processing it (you don't unblind before most/all your data is collected as telling participants whether they have placebo or real vaccine may affect results). So this is the first sign that they are SO FUCKING CLOSE to wrapping up their Phase 3 UK Trial.\n\n[https://twitter.com/jack\\_haywood92/status/1342126131777064961?s=20](https://twitter.com/jack_haywood92/status/1342126131777064961?s=20)\n\n**( IF YOU HAVE A HARD TIME READING, LITERALLY JUST READ THIS PART. IMPORTANT PART BELOW: )**\n\nNot to mention this guy and a lot of other people on Twitter who were unblinded by Novavax were literally told that they should expect preliminary data in 2-3 weeks. Given that most of these posts were made around December 23-24th right before Christmas, 2-3 weeks from then is either the week of Jan 3-9 or Jan 10-16. You have literally been told when to drop your life savings on FDs and when you should expect this stock to moon down to  a 2-week window.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What To Do**\n\nSo if you've been discouraged and been holding NVAX calls that have been getting raped by theta decay, keep bag holding or at least sell synthetic covered calls 1 week out to offset some of that theta decay. If you're holding calls that expire before 1/15, you might want to close your position and roll back your calls to either 1/15 or 1/22.\n\nThis stock is going to the moon as soon as the UK Phase 3 Data releases.
