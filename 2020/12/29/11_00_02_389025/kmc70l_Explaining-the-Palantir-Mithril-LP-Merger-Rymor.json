This FTC notice is not showing the completion of a merger, but actually is showing approval for an early termination of the Harte-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Waiting Period of a pre-merger process.\n\nThe HSR period is a 30 day period where parties to a merger or significant asset transfer make submissions to the FTC and DoJ. This is a component of several standard procedures required by the HSR act, which is basically just a series of antitrust regulations that I'm too retarded to understand.\n\nLink:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart%E2%80%93Scott%E2%80%93Rodino\\_Antitrust\\_Improvements\\_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart%E2%80%93Scott%E2%80%93Rodino_Antitrust_Improvements_Act)\n\nSo, it could be that a majority stake PLTR has been acquired by Mithril, but we do know how much exactly or when this acquisition will take place. All the FTC has said is that in this case the 30 day waiting period to file notifications isn't necessary. Perhaps Thiel and PLTR did all of the document filing really fast or some shit I don't know. Thiel mentioned in the earnings call that Mithril MIGHT take a controlling stake.\n\nHOWEVER, According to the FTC, the HSR Act must also be followed (including the 30 day HSR period) in the event of a **large transfer of assets of just about any kind**, so this notice may not be the confirmation of a majority stake acquisition, but rather the confirmation of Mithril just buying shares in excess of 62.8mm USD (if you exceed this amount you MUST report under the HSR act). Similar HSR early terminations have been approved for other sharebuyers since the DPO. This analysis makes much more sense I think.\n\nWhat does this mean for shareholders? If it's the case that Mithril buys up a large tranche of the float that would certainly be bullish and would definitely squeeze the shorts, but Mithril has only maybe 1B USD AUM ([https://aum13f.com/fund/mithril-lp](https://aum13f.com/fund/mithril-lp)). Is this enough to buy a controlling stake? Somebody who is less retarded than me can do the math.\n\n**TL;DR, Palantir probably not being acquired, but Mithril is buying shares in Palantir to the tune of 62 million or greater.
