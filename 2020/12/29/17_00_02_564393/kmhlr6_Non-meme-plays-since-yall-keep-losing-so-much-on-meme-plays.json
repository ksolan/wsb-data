{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "The most boomer of plays is the utility stock and its a missed opportunity here. These stocks generally underperform the market due to their low risk, but their dividends are nice so people buy them. But while I would not hold the underlying shares, the calls in this do so well if you can time the play. And I think its just about time where utilities are primed to go off...like 10%.\n\nWhy the fuck would you want to buy something that goes up 10% when you all keep chasing 100% with GME or LAZR or some shit?\n\nThe call premiums are incredibly cheap on utilities, but the deltas and gammas are massive relative to the underlying premiums. That means that if the utilities rise even 5-10%, the underlying calls go up like 100% or more! \n\nI think utilities are primed especially now since portfolios are being reallocated right now and into the beginning of the year. People use utilities as a safe investment since bonds suck and they can at least get some dividends from these companies. So there may be some asset reallocation into utilities in the coming days. Utilities also tend to go up like 5-10% within a short time and then consolidate for a long time and then gap up again (usually gaining like 10-15% a year). Technical voodoo shows that RSI is oversold for most utilities and MACD is alsoshowing a reversal in the trend. Short term, calls out a couple months is where I'm at (Feb/March calls). \n\nLonger term, utilities are an interesting play with people buying more EVs, more things that need electricity, and interest rates staying low. What do interest rates have to do with anything? Well low interest rates mean utilities can borrow money cheaply for capital expenditures. And every utility company is heavily investing in solar and wind farms and other clean energy. Plus, the recent ITC extension by Congress in the stimulus means these utilities are going to ramp up their investments in clean energy even more. These investments mean cheaper energy generation and so less overhead costs etc and potentially more profit in the long run. For these reasons, I'm in NEE, AEP, AES, XEL, and SRE periodically for the long term (that is buy on big dips and buy during consolidation a couple months out for the GAINS!).\n\nTL;DR - Utilities bitch!", "author_fullname": "t2_a3rvk", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Non meme plays since yall keep losing so much on meme plays", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_kmhlr6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": true, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609288344.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The most boomer of plays is the utility stock and its a missed opportunity here.
