Well I'm here to do some diligent DD for you autists to YOLO your life savings into and upgrade the depressing life you live in.\n\n**The company is Sony $SNE**. \n\nSome important things to know:\n\n* Sony dominates in 3 major markets; Consumer electronics, entertainment, and telecommunications\n* Recently, Sony raised its future earnings outlook on [record-breaking earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/28/sonys-second-quarter-profit-jumps-13point9percent-on-strong-gaming-demand.html)\n* Current P/E ratio sits at around 14, with a historic high of 127 (peaking in PS2 release and averaging 80+ shortly after subsequent PS releases) industry average and competitors is currently at about 25.\n* Sony also has [many predictable sources of revenue including](https://sonyreconsidered.com/sony-q1-2020-earnings-overview-revenue-2-profits-1-f467dafe5609) a \"Financial Services\" branch that advises anti-yolo boomer's assets.\n\nAssuming you autists even read this far, lets get into what the future metrics for this might mean.\n\nLets start with the **Consumer Electronics or the cash guzzling brrrrr machine Playstation** segment. Currently if I want to buy a PS5 and throw my money at our King and money god Kenichiro Yoshida (CEO of Sony) I would have to go through 3rd party. When PS5's hit the market they sell faster than you retards can lose money. In fact, on average [PS5 is outselling Xbox 2-1](https://screenrant.com/ps5-outselling-xbox-series-x-reseller-website/) right now, in addition to that, the Brrrr-virus will cause the game console market to near [$55+ Billion next year](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/multi-billion-dollar-console-gaming-market/). Also, without getting into politics, its also important to know that approximately 10-20% of Stimmy checks will go to buying electronics based on polls. This segment is Sony's cash cow and makes up 30% of their revenue. This number is expected to grow significantly as more consoles are expected to hit the sales floor and is likely to [**exceed the PS2 RECORD 157m**](https://screenrant.com/ps5-order-sales-playstation-ps2-holiday-2020-preorder) **total consoles sold. 200 Million consoles = $90 Billion in sales!!**\n\nNext is the **steady telecommunications segment; hey Boomers, this tendie stonks only go up segment is for you!** This is your home entertainment stuff like T.V.'s, speakers, solutions segments and mobile phone. They have a ton of patents on imaging and sensing products that they license out to keep revenues boring and flat here. This has been their worst performing segment during Covid and in a relatively fast response, they built the \"sony electronics corporation\", [rebranding their Ericsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Mobile) brand with the goal of significantly decreasing operation costs and bandwagon onto the tech YOLO train.\n\nFinally **the entertainment branch where you autists can laugh, cry, and most importantly tickle your tendies endlessly.** Not including the mad dash to get many licensed PS5 games, Sony's entertainment industry (Columbia pictures) is expected to release a new James Bond No Time to Die and Spiderman 3 in the coming year. Given the shutdown for the last year, the sales in entertainment decreased only 6% thanks to retards like Apple TV+ buying up licensing agreements for Sony's movies and shows. With upcoming hits, and a continued partnership with Apple TV+, revenues are going to quickly recover and even better than before.\n\n**Tldr;** With the growth potential of PS5 alone, Sony should easily be trading at double its P/E of 14 to be closer to its competitors putting the PT at $200+.
