Currently, **Chinese government refuses to allow the PCAOB to inspect audits of companies registered in China and Hong Kong**. This led to the massive scandal and eventual delisting of Luckin Coffee. The Kennedy-Von Hollen bill aims to prohibit securities of a company from being listed on any of the U.S. securities exchanges if the company has failed to comply with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\u2019s (PCAOB) audits for three years in a row.\n\n**Source**: Government website [https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2020/12/house-passes-kennedy-van-hollen-bill-to-protect-americans-from-fraudulent-foreign-companies](https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2020/12/house-passes-kennedy-van-hollen-bill-to-protect-americans-from-fraudulent-foreign-companies)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MYTH 1: This bill does not apply to companies like $BABA or $NIO, because they are already using American auditors.**\n\n**BUSTED**. For example, $NIO uses PricewaterhouseCoopers **Zhong Tian LLP**, which is a **China-based** auditor. **PCAOB currently CANNOT inspect audits from $NIO, or $BABA, or many other Chinese companies**.\n\n**Source**: the **official PCAOB website** where you can find that $NIO is listed as a DENIED ISSUER AUDIT CLIENT\n\n[https://pcaobus.org/oversight/international/denied-access-to-inspections?searchWithin=NIO](https://pcaobus.org/oversight/international/denied-access-to-inspections?searchWithin=NIO)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MYTH 2: PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian LLP is registered with PCAOB. This means PCAOB is able to inspect $NIO\u2019s audits.**\n\n**BUSTED**. An accounting firm being registered with PCAOB **does NOT mean its audits can be inspected**. (To be honest I am quite surprised the internet trolls can dig this far in order to twist facts. They even know the firm is registered. Wow.)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MYTH 3: Whether Trump signs this bill or not does not matter at all, because he will soon leave the White House.**\n\n**BUSTED**. Trump is still the president. After the bill passes both Senate and House, **if president signs, the bill becomes a legislation and will be enforced**. Unless this bill gets repealed after Biden takes over, it will have a lasting impact. And since this bill has gained **unanimous bipartisan support**, it is highly unlikely that the bill will be repealed.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MYTH 4: Because Trump\u2019s TikTok ban hasn\u2019t been successful so far, the Chinese stock delisting bill will not be enforced either.**\n\n**BUSTED**. These are totally different matters. Trump\u2019s TikTok ban is an **executive order**, **not a law**. Executive orders can be overturned by judges. Whereas, if the Kennedy-Von Hollen bill is signed by Trump, it will become **legislation**.\n\nIf anything this tells you, **China did NOT prevent TikTok's US operation from being sold to Oracle. It won't be a surprise if eventually they will NOT prevent from these stocks being delisted.**\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MYTH 5: This bill is fake, because it is passed by Senate first and House second. Real bills get passed in House first.**\n\n**BUSTED**. God, I am so disappointed in the new generation\u2019s understanding of our own government. **Senate bill, proposed by senators, will be voted in the Senate first**. And since this bill is proposed by Senator John Kennedy and Senator Chris Van Hollen, this is a Senate bill. (As an American citizen, **please try to understand how our own government works**)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MYTH 6: $NIO spokeswoman says they have become compliant over the past few months, which means $NIO will not be subject to this bill.**\n\n**PROBABLY INACCURATE**. They can only \u201c**TRY**\u201d to comply with the regulations, but whether they \u201c**CAN**\u201d is **not really up to them**. **It is NOT the companies themselves that are against the inspection of audits, it is the Chinese government.**\n\n**Source**: the damn SEC chairman Jay Clayton himself [https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-vital-role-audit-quality-and-regulatory-access-audit-and-other](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-vital-role-audit-quality-and-regulatory-access-audit-and-other)\n\n\u201c**China\u2019s state security laws are invoked** at times to limit U.S. regulators\u2019 ability to oversee the financial reporting of U.S.-listed, China-based companies. In particular, **Chinese laws governing the protection of state secrets and national security have been invoked to limit foreign access to China-based business books and records and audit work papers**.\u201d\n\nIt is outside companies\u2019 power to comply with US regulations, because the issue concerns Chinese state security law. **You think these companies will disobey Chinese state security laws just to comply with US listing rules?** If the Chinese government says No, there will be no way they can be compliant, no matter how they \u201c**TRY**\u201d.\n\n**Source**: another Chinese EV maker $LI even mentioned such uncertainty in its SEC filing.\n\n\u201cthe adoption of any rules, legislations or other efforts to increase U.S. regulatory access to audit information could cause uncertainty, and **we could be delisted if we are unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement in time**\u201d\n\nThey may not, but they **COULD**.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MYTH 7: The Chinese will make compromise to avoid delisting, because they are weaklings and they always make concessions to the US.**\n\n**UNCERTAIN**. I can\u2019t imagine how people can just go around vouching this as a fact. Do they work for the Chinese government? Are they the officials responsible for the negotiations? How can this be a certainty already?\n\nIf you bet that the Chinese will make compromises, **you are basically betting that Chinese will back down from its own state security law**. **It is possible that they will, but it\u2019s far from certainty**. They have not compromised on an \u201cindependent investigation of coronavirus origin\u201d in Wuhan. They have not compromised on the National Security Law enacted in Hong Kong. How on earth can you be so sure that they will compromise on their own state security law?\n\nThe negotiation on PCAOB inspection between the US and China has taken 10 years. China has not yet compromised in the past 10 years. But now suddenly they will just yield? Is this really logical thinking, or **purely your imagination?**\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan these Chinese stocks go up?
