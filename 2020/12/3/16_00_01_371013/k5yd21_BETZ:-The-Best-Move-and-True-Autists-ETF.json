BETZ is our best betfor the following reasons...\n\nOnline gambling is the future, or at the very least a great investment at the moment\n\nAs we move more and more towards online alternatives and change the way we live our lives because of COVID, one can see why the shift towards online gambling alternatives can be a huge market for people to move to. Especially now, and given we don't know how long COVID may last along with its effects, the online gambling industry is ready to pop off as companies like Golden Nugget Online Gaming are getting approved in states left and right by the week.\n\nPrice action on BETZ indicates it could keep going up and has room to grow\n\nYou'd have to be pretty autistic to not know what i'm talking about in this part. cHaRT gO uPpY iN paST?!?!? cHarT Go uPpY nOW!!!!

LOOK AT APRIL 29c CONTRACTS! .5 PER CONTRACT\n(Im sure these have updated due to price action as of now.)\n\nI know a bunch of you retards can't resist buying options this cheap, so why not do it with a business that is ready to boom and one that has such low volume that we could pump to the moon?\n\nBETZ has holdings in Lancadia, a merger with Golden Nugget Online Gaming (i'll get to why this is important) and other big corporations like DraftKings\n\nIf you take a look at the holdings here...\n\nhttps://www.roundhillinvestments.com/etf/betz/full-holdings\n\nYou can see that BETZ has a 5.36% holding in DKNG which has moved over 400% since its entered the market this april. And yet, BETZ hasn't decreased its holding even in the wake of sports being near abismal at the moment due to the pandemic.\n\nAlong with this, we see that BETZ has 2.66% holdings in Lancadia Holdings, a blank check company that is currently on track to merge with Golden Nugget Online Gaming on December 18th. Why would this ETF hold shares of Lancadia, which is not officially GNOG yet, when the merger could simply fall through and BETZ could lose a ton of money? I believe its because GNOG has a legit business and actually has better revenue and business than DKNG, and because BETZ recognizes this and has a reasonable certainty that GNOG will go public soon.\n\nThe way I see it, is when GNOG merges and becomes public, they will see a huge pump, and BETZ will also increase their holdings in GNOG, pumping BETZ.\n\nAND MOST IMPORTANTLY\n\nTHE MEME POTENTIAL IS HIGH WITH THIS ETF\n\nTell me this....what is more ironic than a bunch of online degenerate gamblers throwing in their life savings into an online gambling ETF?
