In actuality steel demand rose by 4.1%. Developed economies steel demand was expected to fall by 14.9% in 2020 and increase by 7.9% in 2021, that demand increased by 2.8% in 2020. It\u2019s worth noting that these projections were established in May 2020. These were later revised in June 2020 to show a FURTHER decrease in demand. Well here we are in December 2020, with November reports showing not a decrease in demand, but an increase specifically by 158 million tons, the equivalent of the entire EU crude steel production in 2019.\n\nThese demand increases can be seen across the entire supply chain. Iron ore, coking coal, steel scrap, crude steel, pig iron, finished products etc. Demand varies between the products, but they are ALL up, in an industry that had been ramping down production through August! Yearly capability utilization rate is down 17.7% as of December 26th, while in November, the global actual production rates are topping 81-82%. The entire supply chain is currently months behind the demand; futures are reflecting increased prices out to November 2021 today, and contracts are being bought at historically high prices.\n\nYou are starting to see the signs of a large scale global under-supply. Countries are taking proactive action to limit iron ore and coking coal exports signalling increased prices for an extended period. China\u2019s steel production is not profitable with increased iron costs and have been moving towards scrap metals which are also reaching historic highs and will soon run into the same issue. Steel producers have increased their price projections 4 times in the last month blaming raw material price increases. Raw material producers are starting to come under domestic trading restrictions, compounding the current supply chain issues. Not to dive into the details too much here, but just to hit China\u2019s 2021 demand targets global iron supply needs to increase by 400 million tons, between its two largest suppliers it has only raised by 50million tons. If you follow the juniors markets, you can see a race to bring iron mining projects online to fill this gap. The demand bubble is growing, and the only lever left to pull is the cost of goods. There is no more short term options, there is no more idle capacity, there is no more stock. When you ask why are stocks flat through today it's largely because you can curb costs through alternative production. That capacity is quickly dissolving and now we are left with an allocation problem. There has been a dramatic increase in demand combined with slow mill restarts and historically low starting inventory levels held by service centers. Current work orders are 20+ weeks out. Futures are affected through November 2021. There is nothing left to give other than increasing the price of the product through, at a minimum Q1/2 next year.\n\nTLDR:\n\n\ud83d\ude80", "edited": 1609290669.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ll throw some counter points out there as I have ~20% of my portfolio in steel and follow the industrial metals market very closely.
