I will follow up over the next few weeks detailing my short-term and long-term thesis for BP.\n\n# Introduction\n\n**The global energy market has increased more than 7 fold since the 1950s**, and is expected to **grow by up to 2x over the next 3 decades**. The majority of said growth is expected to come from **emerging markets** including Brazil, India, China, and Africa. However, despite the growth in energy demand, **oil and gas firms have been lagging behind in returns** vis-a-vis the rest of the NASDAQ. Brent crude has fared even worse.\n\n**Regulatory push** coupled with an **increase in the social consciousness of climate change** are the primary reasons for slow growth in oil and CNG. This is especially true in developed countries. Global demand for clean energy is expected to grow by up to 8% CAGR over the next decade. In addition, renewables can be as cheap as if not more affordable than crude or gas.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7as924qor9861.png?width=2096&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9efb086bf0f7b12367f3214b8adf9f6130f7856\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, **prices for crude has fallen by more then 50% since November 2019** (when the Lazard research was published). At one point in time, oil futures were negative - large amounts of unconsumed of brent crude and CNG cost producers money to store, and oil tankers piled up on coasts and in the open seas.\n\n# The future of energy\n\nSo is the future of 100% energy renewables? Not quite. **Energy storage continues to be a massive PITA for most municipalities**. Lithium ion cells are extraordinarily expensive and bulky. Unconventional storage techniques (e.g. using bricks, dams, etc) are also pricey. **While there has been a breakthrough in energy production, there hasn't been a breakthrough in energy storage**. Despite the numerous claims recently by firms such as Nanotech in graphene batteries and the like, there remains one major problem - scalability. In fact, this is a problem that has plagued energy scientists and battery engineers over the past 2 decades - anyone can produce graphene cells, but nobody can figure out how to do so at scale. **Energy is consumed consistently, but clean energy cannot be produced constantly.**\n\n[Energy consumption \\(day vs night\\)](https://preview.redd.it/b4s3bpn2u9861.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b27992309519f4ab395c74f0c8ba143c1d23dc6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Wind speeds variability in month of December](https://preview.redd.it/n6jelzseu9861.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=173d8fd02111bf27468bdfbc425ebd53ae9bd4dc)\n\nOf course, solar energy can only be produced in the day, and not at night. This means that during lull periods of energy production (e.g. at night when wind speeds don't support energy production), energy solutions that are not dependent on environmental factors (hydrocarbons - HCRs) need to kick in (unless energy storage is available). But **the cost of energy storage + renewable energy production is still far greater (1.5 to 3x depending on region) than the cost of traditional hydrocarbons**.\n\nIn addition, the inability to store renewable energy affordably and compactly means that it is **not a viable form of energy for high-duration industrial and transportation activities - e.g. shipping, air travel etc**. Therefore, it would be illogical to assume that traditional hydrocarbons would not have a role to play over the next few decades.\n\nToday, the **cost of energy = cost of production + cost of regulations or taxes**. If the cost of climate change were to be internalized in the cost of CNG or crude oil production, the cost of legacy energies is bound to be higher than that of alternatives.\n\nHowever, regulations are not imposed nor are they enforced globally. This means that **countries without a climate change mandate will be inclined to go for the cheapest possible energy source** to fulfill their energy needs. Read: most developing nations. Given that the **cost of energy = cost of production for countries without strong climate change regulations**, there continue to be demand for legacy energies in developing nations. That's BRICS (ex China) = 2.5Bn+ people by 2030.\n\nTherefore, demand for polluting energies such as CNG and oil will continue to increase (albeit marginally) over the decade despite a spike in interest and demand for clean energy. **Developing nations would simply displace developed nations in the consumption of legacy energies**.\n\n**We have not reached peak oil demand; we're just at the bottom of a cycle.** Contrary to popular belief, **demand for oil/gas will not collapse**. In fact, global demand for liquid fuels is expected to **increase by up to 6.3% in 2021**.\n\n# Part 1 Conclusion\n\nHere, I've laid out my case for **liquid fuels and legacy oil companies should be a key part of your COVID-19 reopening trade** (which is pretty duh). I'll expand on this in my next post, and explain why BP is a better buy compared to its peers, both in the short term (<1Y) and the long term.", "author_fullname": "t2_16w7h1", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Part 1: Bull Case for BP (Industry Trends)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 86, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"7as924qor9861": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 66, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7as924qor9861.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=310b54a93f72de5454dfe1e2e6dfb39c7004322c"}, {"y": 133, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7as924qor9861.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ab0354d2311a399874e2cf34476a060fa139d542"}, {"y": 197, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7as924qor9861.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9089ac6651da46ad4652e2a5590c3ee52f71c40d"}, {"y": 395, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7as924qor9861.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6cb588f8674cf7d4da187009bda47f015a95c018"}, {"y": 592, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7as924qor9861.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=41aebc8601cb1fdb68d476b978d923c177362fa5"}, {"y": 666, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7as924qor9861.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b61d59b722653b2b7f9811edf5562fec96d82426"}], "s": {"y": 1294, "x": 2096, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7as924qor9861.png?width=2096&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9efb086bf0f7b12367f3214b8adf9f6130f7856"}, "id": "7as924qor9861"}, "b4s3bpn2u9861": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 78, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b4s3bpn2u9861.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f493975f4b5474d1d36073d5bf068fc514681496"}, {"y": 157, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b4s3bpn2u9861.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4462ae560aca9db1ae23dd7425d4675f7de9c1b8"}, {"y": 233, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b4s3bpn2u9861.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c527009d7d68006698fb2d0e4275c98c0e11a71f"}], "s": {"y": 437, "x": 599, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b4s3bpn2u9861.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b27992309519f4ab395c74f0c8ba143c1d23dc6"}, "id": "b4s3bpn2u9861"}, "n6jelzseu9861": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 58, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n6jelzseu9861.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=343bed856443940d9a2d705e53f9393ca5435ed3"}, {"y": 116, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n6jelzseu9861.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=53d6b0af415f864057b89f54b4068d0129d39da0"}, {"y": 172, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n6jelzseu9861.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=176af597937154e6bb7f6625c598695fba05d79e"}], "s": {"y": 269, "x": 500, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n6jelzseu9861.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=173d8fd02111bf27468bdfbc425ebd53ae9bd4dc"}, "id": "n6jelzseu9861"}}, "name": "t3_kmxqrh", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": true, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/HfNulfvywEugNn6MhJn2YL3S8oY4FlGvsEbQB8rLN6U.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609342384.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>TLDR: Buy BP.
