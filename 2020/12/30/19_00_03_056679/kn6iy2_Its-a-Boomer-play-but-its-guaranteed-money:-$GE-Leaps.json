{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": " So, this DD isn't actual TA. It is a series of (what I believe) are **very** safe assumptions: a combination of political analysis, energy trends, and inevitable nation-wide \"**must have**\" investments. WARNING: this is long.

This \\^ infrastructure is inevitable, either way. $GE is the #1 and only American HVDC provider, 220k workers +. $GE Renewables don't contribute to revenue right now, but HVDC + Wind (which will be yuge) make it a massive discount rn.** \n\n\\-----\n\nI am going to lay down a series of linear assumptions and realities below. I feel like these assumptions are all safe, therefore, it is highly likely that the outcome I describe comes to fruition within the next 4 years. \n\n1. **EVs are going to see mass adoption**. Every automaker + Apple is trying to get in on this. BEV advantages are simply too great. It is highly likely that by 2025, 30% or more of the U.S. fleet will be electric. This will only continue to 2030. \n\n2. **This will cause big increases in demand on the grid**. Go google around: Grid owners are ecstatic about this. The average American home uses \\~33 kWh of energy per day. I own a model 3, and BARELY drive (i dont commute) and still use \\~10kWh per day for driving. A commuter may use around 30-35 kWh per day just to drive. By 2025, if \\~30% of the U.S. fleet is electric, that'll cause a significant increase in grid demand. More important, though, is that energy generation investment takes time. Grid owners know this is coming. They will beef up generation faster and faster as the U.S. economy becomes more **electrified** instead of based on fossil fuels. \n\n3. **Added capacity is likely to be green**. This has 2 causes. (1) Finance: Coal isn't cost competitive with solar and wind anymore. Solar is getting very, very cheap and more and more efficient. Offshore wind is having a renaissance. Nuclear is greener, but more expensive (\\~$4,200 per kW), and NIMBYism will prevail. Solar/wind + batteries is cheaper than $4,200 per kW right now. Additionally, Alaskan oil can't even get bank financing now, and Coal isn't expanding. People see the end is near. (2) Politics. Dem administration for the next 4 years, and green energy isn't the political football it was 10 years ago. Fighting renewables isn't the focus of the right anymore. Additionally, Democrats resist natural gas expansion: remember the Keystone pipeline? Natural gas is pretty green and cheap af, but its not everywhere, and I deem it unlikely that population centers (NE Corridor, Cali, Chicago, etc etc) are going to be OK with more and more natural gas plants. I deem it unlikely that we're gonna be a 50%+ natural gas country. \n\n4. **Biden will do an infrastructure bill**. This will happen. Its popular, its needed, and its perfect for his huge desire to be seen as a bipartisan president. \n\n5. **Biden will try and include moderate green elements in this bill because he knows he won't get green policies otherwise**. Even if the two Georgia seats go blue, there is \\*\\*ZERO\\*\\* chance the Dems blow the filibuster. You have (1) a president that won by a narrow margin, that (2) isn't that popular, (3) who has a bad-looking 2022 midterm, that (4) won't run in 2024 cause hes ancient, with (5) a not-too-popular VP, can't afford to run roughshod over norms and weaken their 2022 prospects. 50-50 plus Kamala casting the deciding vote? Please. Not happening.\n\n6. **Green elements in an infrastructure bill will have to benefit Red states** in order to get passed. We're not gonna get a carbon tax / cap and trade system. We're not gonna get massive oil taxes\n\n7. **A lot of Red states are RICH in renewables**. Look at these maps ([https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html](https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html)) for U.S. solar, and this map ([https://energy.maryland.gov/Pages/Info/renewable/windmaps.aspx](https://energy.maryland.gov/Pages/Info/renewable/windmaps.aspx)) for U.S. wind. What do you notice? For the most part, **there are huge wind opportunities in the Midwest**. **There is huge solar potential across Texas and the South**. Outside of California and Northeast Corridor offshore wind, renewables are concentrated in the Midwest and South. \n\n8. **Right now, we can't take full advantage of these areas because the infrastructure to transport 2025-2030 sized energy demands to population centers don't exist**. This is key. Right now, the U.S. energy grid is largely disconnected in terms of HVDC lines (high voltage lines capable of transmitting huge amounts of power with minimal loss: it resembles small, little fiefdoms. Google \"U.S. HVDC Map\" (make sure you're looking at the current ones--not the projections). We don't have that much HVDC infrastructure. In this past, there wasn't a huge emphasis because there wasn't that much need....renewables price efficiency didn't make for THAT compelling of a need, and localized Grid owners made-do with the status quo. **HVDC network improvement is INEVITABLE.** Renewables are too cheap, and the efficiencies inherent in concentrating wind and solar where appropriate are too vast. Right now, as you read this, there is an UNDERSEA Ultra HVDC cable being laid between Australia and Singapore to transport solar power. I shit you not. Europe and China are building vast HVDC and Ultra HVDC lines right now. **Look at this wiki page:** [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_HVDC\\_projects**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HVDC_projects)**. See how many are in Asia/Euro vs the U.S.? Its a fucking joke.** It is extremely unlikely that we're gonna just slap solar and wind where they are sub-optimal, rather than seek greater ROI. Mass HVDC lines are inevitable. \n\n9. General Electric is the only large American HVDC provider. GE employs 200,000+ Americans. It is literally one of the oldest American companies. It has a super American brand name, and is politically connected. \n\n10. HVDC is **expensive**. I'm not an expert, but because of NIMBY, its likely that a lot of HVDC will be buried along rail lines (From what I read). HVDC between hundreds of wind/solar fields across the U.S. will need to be built, plus HVDC / Ultra HVDC between renewable zones to NE Corridor, Chicago, California. I'd google around for figures, but basically, its $$$$$$$$$. \n\n11. **Right now,** General Electric's Renewables sector barely brings in any revenue (17% 2019 revenue, around $15 billion [https://www.statista.com/statistics/245430/revenue-of-general-electric-by-segment/#:\\~:text=Aviation%20and%20power%20are%20the,U.S.%20dollars%20one%20year%20before](https://www.statista.com/statistics/245430/revenue-of-general-electric-by-segment/#:~:text=Aviation%20and%20power%20are%20the,U.S.%20dollars%20one%20year%20before).). The new CEO is actually pretty fucking great ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.\\_Lawrence\\_Culp\\_Jr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Lawrence_Culp_Jr)). He turned Danaher around, and is setting up GE for success. GE has a TON of debt (debt/equity above 6.0), but what will happen to the stock when GE is given absolutely gigantic contracts in order to buff up the U.S. Grid? They really are the only American company with the production/size ability to do this. What happens when the GE Renewables sector grows by 4-5x over the next 10 years? Grid improvements + Wind turbines are going to go up bigly. That $15 billion revenue line item may increase dramatically. \n\nIf you read this far, let me restate that this isn't TA. I don't have strikes for you. I don't know how to value HVDC and Wind over the next decade. However, I have a **STRONG** feeling in my nips that $GE is going to be a major American comeback story, and \\^ that political/economic/renewable trends make it exceedingly likely that GE will have huge grid contracts coming up. **How much of this is already baked into the price? I have no idea, but I do know that the big boys don't gamble on Adderall rantings like this, so it probably isn't baked in.** \n\nI'm using GE to add some safety to my current 100% TSLA portfolio.
