{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I\u2019ve originally posted this DD in another sub but given it\u2019s popularity a few people have asked me to post it in r/wallstreetbets as well. I was a bit hesitant at first because one of my post got removed by the mods when this company was still a SPAC. But now since December 22nd it is trading on the Nasdaq as a new public company with the ticker GOEV.\n\nThis post may or may not be removed by the mods but here you go as requested. \n\nI\u2019m a former sell side professional for a big firm so my methodology is based on my experience and the information publicly available including data and financial projections published by the company. In consequence I have less data and insight than insiders and early Hedge Funds investors. This is my personal view and not a recommendation of any sort.\n\nPrerequisite is that you already know the basics of Canoo which is a Californian based EV company pre production and pre revenue. Their unique selling points include a proprietary steer-by-wire skateboard technology so they can interchange \u201ctop hats\u201d and develop new vehicles much faster and a subscription-only business model for their first B2C lifestyle vehicle. They also have B2B EV on a more classic selling scheme. \n\nI invite you to read the top comments from the OP as they contain valuable developments. \n\n**The Market Cap and New Shares Issuance**\n\nBased on SEC filings the number of shares of new Canoo is as follows:\n\n* 175M held by old Canoo shareholders (including management and employees)\n* 32.325M held by PIPE\n* 37,307,189 Hennessy C A C converted to GOEV which for now represents the only tradable shares at this time\n\nTo which we need to add shares that could be issued in the next weeks:\n\n* 36,092,750 warrants (ratio 1 warrant for 1 share) of which 22,511,250 public and 13,581,500 private\n* 15M Earnout Shares for management: three lots of 5M shares each at Milestones for share price to reach $18 $25 and $30\n\naggregating all these elements and only 5M Earnout Shares so far we get 285,724,939 outstanding shares ; at $14.50 per share that\u2019s a market cap of $4.14bn. Note that you would get an extra dilution of 1.7% for every 5M new Earnout Shares issued. Also there is a lack of transparency until Canoo produces a new SEC filing in which the company update the exact number of outstanding shares. For instance when I check market cap on IBKR it would tell me $3.6bn and a totally wrong number of shares. I did not find any info about the PIPE lock period to hold their shares. In fact these kind of deals can remain undisclosed for a certain time. But some large pre existing shareholders including founders, directors, holders of 3%+ pre-SPAC have deals to hold their shares for a total of 116.2M for a period in between 6M to 12M after the Closing of the Business Combination (21-Dec-20).\n\n**Chairman Tony Aquila vs CEO Ulrich Kranz**\n\nI want to address this subject early in this thread for three reasons. First it is not discussed enough on the internet. Second it potentially has massive implications in the public perception of the company. And third insiders and HF have a massive advantage if they know what drama is going on amid the board. I believe it was first reported by The Verge dot com so I\u2019ll quote them on the matter:\n\nAquila told The Verge the company\u2019s immediate focus has changed. \u201cWhen I invested in [Canoo], I didn\u2019t invest in it for the lifestyle vehicle. To me, I saw that as a derivative, but that the real asset was this multipurpose delivery platform,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe way I would look at it is this is a re-founding of the company, just kind of like Elon did to Tesla\u201d. Aquila, who comes from a finance and software background, invested $35M in Canoo this summer through his firm before the merger and before he was elevated to chairman. \u201cHe put money in [Tesla], just like I did, became the chair, had a different vision, comes out of the tech world. So I can completely relate and appreciate what he\u2019s done for the industry.\u201d\n\nFounders always intended to use the van\u2019s modular platform to power other vehicles, but Aquila is supercharging that vision by accelerating those plans.\n\nWith that in mind, there are changes being made to corporate structure. Ulrich Kranz, one of the BMW executives who co-founded Canoo and the current CEO, is no longer on the company\u2019s board of directors. He\u2019ll instead be a \u201cspecial adviser\u201d to Aquila, and while he\u2019ll remain CEO, his contract was renegotiated and now includes language that accounts for the possibility of him being replaced (SEC filings). \n\n\u201cI want to build a world class company here, and what I\u2019ve said to everyone is, look, you\u2019re going to go as far in this company and as big as this company as we all collectively do. But it\u2019s like a baseball team. Everybody\u2019s got to play their position and they\u2019ve got to play it really well for every season, and those positions can change over time,\u201d Aquila told The Verge when asked about Kranz\u2019s new contract. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a role [for Kranz]. There\u2019s definitely advice that can happen. But to scale an organization at this level, I mean, that\u2019s a different experience than he has.\u201d\n\nAnd they add: For what it\u2019s worth, if Kranz is removed as CEO but remains as Aquila\u2019s adviser, his salary will more than triple from $648K to $2.5M. [end of quote]\n\nNow, it is up to the market and every single investor to ultimately judge this move. What is irrefutable although is that it injects a lot of uncertainty to the company at a very sensible time when they just turned public. My personal opinion is I don\u2019t like at all. I am way more confident with an individual as Kranz who has co-founded the company, who used to be the boss of Project i at BMW. He led the release of the gorgeous i8 and the i3 who are arguably among the most iconic EV produced by traditional automakers. He\u2019s an engineer with a long track-record in the auto industry and he sounds humble. On the other hand you have a late investor who didn\u2019t do anything significant in the industry who just ousted Kranz from the board. And to add insult to injury he dares compare himself to Papa Musk.\n\nNow imagine you have millions on the line. A company pre revenue. Egocentric chairman who is trying to be the new Elon. And you got in at $10 per unit with a free 1-for-1 warrant to ride. You can easily imagine it makes sense taking profit and move to the next play. While still having exposition to price appreciation thanks to the warrants. To finish on this point the Investor Presentation and the original YouTube videos presented Kranz as the face of the company. But the latest video on the B2B EV is all about Aquila bragging.\n\n**The Price Action vs Value**\n\nThe hot question right now is how low the share price can fall. It\u2019s 14.50 at the time of my writing. And it basically been red every single day since the initial GOEV quote on Nasdaq on December 22nd. It actually opened +20% on that day and rallied to 14.90 +27% (10c below the 15.00 Milestone to unlock a new 5M potential issuance to management) but then sharply (maybe surprisingly?) reversed to finish the day negative.\n\nI\u2019ll go quickly about valuation because it is solely based on financial projections provided by the company in the Investor Presentation to the SEC in August 2020. I agree that they proposed conservative assumptions although there is obviously a variety of risks which could prevent them to reach their goals. On a DCF model you get 3 scenarii with $12.25 $18.50 and $24.50 price targets low mid high (before any dilution / new shares) on a 20% discount rate. Interestingly the SOTP model including a Netflix type of business model / margins for the B2C would bring you to a $35.75 per share. \n\nThat\u2019s based on what they knew about themselves in the summer. Closer to the Business Combination date they have raised their guidance: Hennessy said on 7 Dec: \u201cSince announcing the transaction, Canoo has seen substantial growth in consumer demand and significant interest from potential partners in its proprietary market leading EV platform and underlying technologies. Canoo is efficiently allocating capital by leveraging this platform and has identified new opportunities significantly increasing its TAM (total addressable market) in both B2B and B2C (business to customer) end markets. We have never been more excited about the future of Canoo and look forward to closing our planned merger later in December.\u201d\n\nThere is a clear disconnection between the perceived discounted value of the company and the probably exaggerated beating the share price is taking since it is floating as a new Canoo. Undoubtedly a lot of paper handed retail investors have been shaken - some of them at a loss. But again that\u2019s the Risk and Reward of a SPAC play in general and furthermore through merger. It is designed for HF to make risk-less money in exchange of lending large amounts for the initial SPAC-IPO. Nobody wants to pay the bill once the redemption window has closed.\n\nIf you are a mid long term believer in Canoo the brand then $15 a share is cheap for what this company could become - all things equal. \n\n**The Vision**\n\nWhen I imagine an individual vehicle in the near future I for sure think of a non-fossil energy one. So EV or any sustainable energy are the sense of history. But what about consumption habits?\n\nIt used to be: you buy a car you lose circa 20% VAT value as soon as you\u2019ve paid the check  + an extra % of value instantly destroyed because it becomes a second-hand product without a natural price appreciation (as opposed to a house or a Swiss manufactured watch). You have to take care of it, insure it and when you don\u2019t need it anymore you need to engage time, effort, and cost to resell it. \n\nI can totally see their B2C business model playing out: you download an app, you register, you choose your skin, you pay $599 a month (maybe less?) and you go driving your EV. Insurance, caretake, charging included. Once you\u2019ve bored of it you finish your month and that\u2019s it. No more liability no headache. The next step being the car drives itself to a certain degree. Which they also incorporated as about-to-be-ready (2.5 autonomy out of 5). But apparently that\u2019s not good enough for Aquila who wants to push B2B. I have the feeling the stock is being partly punished for his arrogance. \n\n**The PR and Marketing**\n\nSee for yourself. Go on their insta and YouTube and compare with the other EV competitors outside of the whales Tesla and so on. They are above. They took communication seriously. You can even spot Off-White and Bape skins in one of their promo video. But again they must decide on who will be The Face of their brand. And this decision will be extremely pivotal. They are offering a new lifestyle. Don\u2019t show off an old irrelevant investor or get punished for it.\n\nOne word on American-made: I believe there is a tradition of buying American cars for the American people. So it\u2019s going to be Tesla on the U.S soil or among the new offering locally designed. I don\u2019t see Nio and the likes gaining a significant market share over there. That said Canoo has had large Chinese investors stakes before the SPAC.\n\n**The Warrants**\n\nI have witnessed a lot of speculation around them so let\u2019s have a clearer picture. The company wrote: Each Warrant will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of the Company\u2019s initial Business Combination or 12 months from the closing of the Public Offering and will expire five years after the completion of the Company\u2019s initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\n\nOnce the Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Warrants in whole and not in part at a price of $0.01 per Warrant upon a minimum of 30 days\u2019 prior written notice of redemption, only in the event that the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s shares of Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within the 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the Warrant holders. [end of quote]\n\nI know it\u2019s not that easy to read so let me go straight to the point. GOEVW (so the Warrant) will be exercisable once both these 2 events have passed. Initial SPAC-IPO (5-Mar-19) +12months so 5-Mar-20 so that has passed we clear. And Business Combination was on 21-Dec-20 +30days = on 21st January 2021 the Warrant will be exercisable. The company can not redeem the warrants before they are exercisable. \n\nSo I personally don\u2019t see any sophisticated scheme here. They are 1 for 1 ratio with an exercise price of $11.50. The intrinsic value is 3.00 when GOEV is 14.50. They have ranged 3.20 3.82 today with a now price of 3.45 (on 14.50 ref). So the extra 0.45 is comparable to the time value in options. The expiry is quite far on 25-Sep-25 so the time decay or theta burn is negligible on a daily basis. Altogether that could be an indication that warrant holders are not panicking and not dumping their W for a discount and estimate that GOEV is credible enough to trade above 11.50 on a long haul.\n\n**Open Thread**\n\nThis was supposed to be a quick write-up but it actually took longer than I thought and I probably will add more elements in the edit and/or comments.", "author_fullname": "t2_11ztnb", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Canoo Stop or GOEV", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_knql7l", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 33, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609452481.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019ve originally posted this DD in another sub but given it\u2019s popularity a few people have asked me to post it in <a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets\">r/wallstreetbets</a> as well.

Altogether that could be an indication that warrant holders are not panicking and not dumping their W for a discount and estimate that GOEV is credible enough to trade above 11.50 on a long haul.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Open Thread</strong></p>\n\n<p>This was supposed to be a quick write-up but it actually took longer than I thought and I probably will add more elements in the edit and/or comments.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "5692ce02-b860-11e5-b542-0edc7016bbd3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#365b8c", "id": "knql7l", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": {"name": "Rivaaal", "fullname": "t2_11ztnb"}, "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 40, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/knql7l/canoo_stop_or_goev/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/knql7l/canoo_stop_or_goev/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1756131, "created_utc": 1609423681.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false, "comment_limit": 2048, "comment_sort": "confidence", "comments": [{"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 8, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_knql7l", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ghluo6l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "author": {"name": "k12nmonky", "fullname": "t2_6cupi"}, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_knql7l", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_6cupi", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "body": "thanks for the thought out DD, what are your positions? as a call holder thats lost quite a bit on this company already, i have thought about buying back in in shares or leaps", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>thanks for the thought out DD, what are your positions? as a call holder thats lost quite a bit on this company already, i have thought about buying back in in shares or leaps</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/knql7l/canoo_stop_or_goev/ghluo6l/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_ghluo6l", "created": 1609452759.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1609423959.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "replies": [{"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_knql7l", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ghlv2y5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "author": {"name": "Rivaaal", "fullname": "t2_11ztnb"}, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ghluo6l", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_11ztnb", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "collapsed": false, "body": "I\u2019m long shares 17.08 average.
