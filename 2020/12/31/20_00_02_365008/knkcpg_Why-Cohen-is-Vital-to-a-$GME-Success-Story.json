{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Good evening, gentleman, I have been doing a bit of digging into GameStop and I found something I thought was worth posting about and would further add to everyone's confirmation bias.\n\nI happened to be looking at various company reviews on glassdoor and I figured I would look at the company I have my life savings invested in ($GME). Most of the reviews were from sales associates and people who worked at physical locations. I narrowed it down to district managers because I figured they would have a better feel for how the company is run as a whole and not just how an individual store is run. I found one review that immediately stuck out and hit the nail on the head as to why Ryan Cohen is such a vital component to GameStops hopeful success story. From a former employee who worked there for more than 10 years, under the cons section: \"Management treats people as a number and doesn't care.\" And then under advice to management: \"Focus on PEOPLE! they will bring you profit.\" I think that this right here is the essence of why Ryan Cohen is the person to turn this company around. Cohen knows that putting people over profit ultimately leads to higher profits. Let me tell you a story to explain to you why Cohen is the right person for this. Coincidentally, about a year ago my mother had bought a few things from Chewy (founded by Ryan Cohen) online for our cats. After placing the order she realized that she forgot to add something small to her cart before checking out. She called their customer service number and told them what had happened and asked if she could add it to the order and get it charged to her card so she didn't have to pay for shipping on a whole new order. The lady on the phone, without hesitation, politely told her that she would add it to the order and that she would just give it to us for free out of appreciation for giving them our business. Since then every single item we have gotten for our animals has come from Chewy, because we simply like the company and how they treat their customers. This is what Ryan Cohen can bring to GameStop. With RC, GameStop has the potential to transform a dying company focused more on profits than the customer, to a successful, rapidly growing company that puts it customers first.\n\nFurther, Boomer CEO George Sherman only has a 28% approval rating among employees. This proves that the only true way for GameStop to transform into what Cohen wants it to be is to oust the board and find a new CEO. It is very hard to be bullish on a company who's CEO only has a 28% approval rating with its own employees. If GameStop wants a successful future, Sherman needs to go.\n\nPositions: 1000 shares and various calls between $20 and $35 expiring on either 4/16 or 7/16\n\n[Link to that Glassdoor Review](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-GameStop-RVW32859615.htm)\n\nTL;DR - Ryan Cohen is an essential part in the transformation of $GME\n\n\ud83d\ude80", "author_fullname": "t2_6x2npmfr", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Why Cohen is Vital to a $GME Success Story", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Discussion"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_knkcpg", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 103, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 103, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609423492.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Good evening, gentleman, I have been doing a bit of digging into GameStop and I found something I thought was worth posting about and would further add to everyone&#39;s confirmation bias.</p>\n\n<p>I happened to be looking at various company reviews on glassdoor and I figured I would look at the company I have my life savings invested in ($GME).
