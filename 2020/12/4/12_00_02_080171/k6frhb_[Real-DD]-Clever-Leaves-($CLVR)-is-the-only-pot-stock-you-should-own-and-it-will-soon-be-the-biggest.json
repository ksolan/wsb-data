I have come out of retirement and taken a break from my usual routine of fucking sluts, yachting around the world and getting my toes licked by Dan Bilzerian to speak once again with my follow dumbasses, bagholders, suckers, Young Trillionaires\u2026 and yes, even the hater\u2019s. I have come to pump the shit out of **UHHHH I MEAN**\u2026 I have come to... *recommend* a stock that I think you all should buy. Heh heh, yeah that\u2019ll work. You might remember me as [the guy whose reddit post single-handedly killed WeWork](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d6618z/real_dd_i_read_analysed_all_180_pages_of_the/). \n\n**Clever Leaves** (Listed as $S\u0226MA right now, soon to be $CLVR on Dec 18th once they\u2019re added to the Nasdaq) is basically one thing \u2013 They\u2019re a low cost producer of pharmaceutical-grade skunk weed. They have bigass facilities in Colombia  with 10million square feet of cannabis production, and they\u2019re definitely not involved in any cocaine production. If you\u2019ve seen Narcos, you know that nothing shady ever happens in Columbia. I haven\u2019t watched it but I have it on good word that there\u2019s talk about \u201cPlato and Plomo\u201d, which I think means Plantains and Plumage. A tropical paradise, no?\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem with weed companies like ACB, Tilray and Cronos? Well, they put the cart before the horse with their acquisition-before-product strategies. If you don\u2019t know what that means because you\u2019re a 14 year old using your parents\u2019 names to make a Robinhood account, it basically means they fucked themselves over by expanding too fast into buying random fucking companies (Bespoke grow rooms, anyone?) with their investor money without actually growing their weed at an affordable rate. The cost of producing weed isn\u2019t economical in Canada because the conditions for growing it there suck and the labor costs and taxes are insane. A bunch of companies set up shop in Canada since it was the first real country to legalize weed (**Ur**u**g**u**ay** doesn't count) and because they were fans of some guys called Tim Horton and Terry Fox, but ironically gimped themselves in the process. CLVR is going to sell weed to hipster Europeans who don't know how much they're overpaying, it fucking owns. They already have production and offices in Portugal and Germany. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nCLVR is going to eliminate all competitors in the end. *Period*. Any dumbass can throw a seed in the ground in their backyard and piss on it daily and harvest enough pissweed to get them through the winter. Legalized weed is a cannibalistic exercise and a terrible investment because once you legalize, the margin on the product drops through the floor and it gets really fucking hard to produce the product (you know, the actual weed?) at a price that won\u2019t see you burn through cash like an ashy crackhead on his last rock. If you are actually reading this whole post and didn't just glaze over and buy in because it was really long, PM me and I'll send you my wife's boyfriend's nudes that she sends me to mock how much of a loser I am. Regardless, **the only way to make money in legalized weed is to grow at insanely low prices and under cut the competition which will allow you to buy up market share and then buy out the competition, and then start to raise prices**, which is CLVR's strategy. I learned this from a scene in The Wire btw.\n\nI once called ACB the Goodwill of pot stocks because they bring in just about anything they can find and it\u2019s staffed by retards. CLVR is the opposite, the people running the company have been there from the start and don\u2019t get fired and replaced once a year like most Canadian pot stock company execs. [Here's a video of the CEO explaining their company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkCE-DTSYuA). I gotta be honest kinda zoned out but he doesn't come off like a grifter to me so that's probably a good thing. He used to work in Blackstone and was an actual investor, which is basically the opposite of a WSB poster, so that means he's undoubtedly profitable. The rest of the management and SPAC team is a group of rich-ass investment banker crackers, so you just know they're finna make some coin.
