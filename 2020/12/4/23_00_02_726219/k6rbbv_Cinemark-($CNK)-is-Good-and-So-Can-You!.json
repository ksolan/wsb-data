I\u2019ve been a lurker of this subreddit for a few years now and always enjoyed the content, the shitposts, the memes, and the rare DD\u2019s. But this week, I\u2019ve feeling for my fellow retards, especially those that gambled their 401k\u2019s and Holographic Charizard Pokemon cards on $PLTR. Orders on $ROPE seem to be up BIGLY \ud83d\ude80 over the past week, so I wanted to offer a bit of DD on an industry that you and your Netflix and Chill partner have become well acquainted with this year being stuck at home. At the very least, you owe it to your hand to hear me out about Cinemark ($CNK).\n\nTLDR: $CNK 15 Jan 22, 20 Strike Bought Calls / $CNK 19 Mar 21, 12.5 Strike Sold Puts\n\nSo quickly, just to get this out of the way: I am a curator of shit. I originally started this reddit account several years ago because I got tired of playing shitty Super Mario Maker levels and had finally decided to make my own. Then, a year later, I was on a Pokemon kick and was desperately looking to trade Pokemon on my 3ds. It\u2019s where I learned to sift through shitty trades and allowed my autism to truly flourish. You ever need a 5 IV hacked Japanese Ditto to get a perfectly spec\u2019d egg? Do you have any idea what the hell I\u2019m talking about? No, probably not. But I bring this up because when you\u2019re willing look into the details so much for a fucking Pokemon, it only makes sense to use that same treatment for a financial investment. And just like Super Mario Maker, I got tired of seeing shitty trades and wanted to do something myself. So I went and studied markets and options the past four years and will likely try and make a career out of finance now.\n\nBut you\u2019re here to learn about Cinemark. And here\u2019s what you already know: Movie theaters have been absolutely crippled by Covid. That\u2019s no secret. And just when vaccine news helps to get the likes of CNK and AMC back on their feet a bit, Warner Bros comes out yesterday and says they are moving all of their films to HBO Max. This announcement alone sent movie stocks tumbling as much as 20%.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/warner-bros-to-release-movies-on-hbo-max-threatening-theatrical-windows.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/warner-bros-to-release-movies-on-hbo-max-threatening-theatrical-windows.html)\n\nTo add insult to injury, AMC had already announced ANOTHER 200 million shares in a public stock offering THAT MORNING to raise money, with their CEO going on to threaten investors that AMC will go bankrupt without help. This probably isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve heard of a possible AMC bankruptcy either, especially if you\u2019re a subscriber to this very subreddit.\n\n[https://investorplace.com/2020/12/amc-stock-why-amc-entertainment-shares-sunk-16-today/](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/amc-stock-why-amc-entertainment-shares-sunk-16-today/)\n\nAnd here is where I\u2019m gonna start throwing some numbers at you. Because as awful as it is to threaten investors with the fear of bankruptcy, the reality is that AMC is in SERIOUS financial trouble. Pulled from TD Ameritrade, here\u2019s a few numbers for you from their balance sheet (as of their earnings in Q3 2020):\n\nAssets:\n\nCash/Cash Equivalents: $506 million\n\nTotal Current Assets: $609 Million\n\nProp./Plant/Equip, Net: $6,808 million\n\nTotal Assets: $10,876 million\n\nLiabilities:\n\nCurrent Accounts Payable/Accrued Expenses: $1,057 million\n\nTotal Current Liabilities: $1,588 million\n\nTotal Debt: $5,919 million\n\nTotal Liabilities: $13,246 million\n\nSo I know what you\u2019re thinking: TLDR, StOp NuMbErs GiVe PoSiTiOnS ReTaRd. And I\u2019ll get there, just like George R.R. Martin is getting to the end of the Game of Thrones series. But what is really important to see here is that for the CURRENT period that ends in one year, AMC has a deficit of $979 million ($1,588 million in current liabilities minus $609 million in current assets). And normally, when in such a situation, you generally have three solutions: go offer more stock; go sell some of your company; or, you take out loans with a creditor. AMC is doing the former with a stock offering. But why not go to a creditor and get a loan? Well, maybe it\u2019s because YTD for Q1, Q2, and Q3, AMC has already drawn down a shit town of debt out just to cover their ass. Creditors likely will not be willing to finance this sinking ship much longer and AMC are in legitimate trouble.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/amc-could-run-out-of-cash-by-then-end-of-2020-company-warns.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/amc-could-run-out-of-cash-by-then-end-of-2020-company-warns.html)\n\nSo this brings me to Cinemark and their balance sheet. And it\u2019s here I\u2019ll give you a few more numbers from their Q3 2020 Balance Sheet:\n\nAssets:\n\nCash/Equivalents: $826 million\n\nTotal Current Assets: $984 million\n\nProp./Plant/Equip, Net: $2,832 million\n\nTotal Assets: $5,803 million\n\nLiabilities:\n\nAccounts Payable/Accrued Expenses: $599 million\n\nTotal Current Liabilities: $624 million\n\nTotal Debt: $2,519 million\n\nTotal Liabilities: $4,796 million\n\nSo I\u2019d like to immediately draw your attention to the current period for CNK. Due to their stronger cash position (which in fairness, has been due to financing this year as well), they have a net surplus of $360 million for the next 12 months. What\u2019s more, they can cover ALL of their current liabilities with their cash position alone for the next year. This is to say that if you believe that the Covid will be behind us within a year and that movie theaters will at least by open back to full capacity, Cinemark has the financial strength to survive another year without any sales.\n\nThe next thing I\u2019d like to bring to your attention is the SIZE of both companies. If you look at the Prop./Plant/Equipment for AMC and CNK, you\u2019ll see that\n\nAMC has $6,808 million in assets\n\nCNK has $2,832 million in assets\n\nAMC is the largest movie theater company in the world, and here, it shows. They are over twice the size of Cinemark in property alone, and their total assets are just over twice the value of Cinemark\u2019s as well. So AMC does have quite a bit of market share on the movie theater industry. However, with AMC\u2019s financial weakness and a looming threat of bankruptcy, here are some possible outcomes:\n\n1. AMC goes bankrupt. They will have to reorganize their corporate structure and will likely lose some of their theaters along the way. Competitors may have the option to buy some of these theaters and AMC loses some of their market share which could be beneficial for CNK.\n2. AMC looks to merge. This is true for the larger market as a whole, but with belabored businesses that are on the verge of bankruptcy, mergers and acquisitions look to be a huge market in the upcoming year. And while Cinemark doesn\u2019t have the financial strength, on paper, to take on the massive debts the AMC currently holds, there is something to consider here in the numbers. If AMC is twice the size of Cinemark, Cinemark\u2019s market share would increase by 3x on an outright acquisition of AMC (and that\u2019s assuming they took on their debts as they stand today). Cinemark would more than double their debt in doing so, but CNK has also shown that they can manage their book better. They may see the added market share as a warrantable risk to take on.\n3. AMC gets the funding it needs and survives in the short term. Cinemark isn\u2019t really affected by this outcome.\n\nNext, let\u2019s consider the technicals of Cinemark. Cinemark was trading just above $30 before the great stock market fall back in March. It was trading as low as $5.71 at it\u2019s lowest, and outside a one month period from the end of September to November 9th(vaccine news day), CNK was trading in a price channel that bottomed out around $10. With positive vaccine news and a rollout of vaccinations, it is likely that CNK will be able to open its doors again in the next six months. As such, there is a case to be made for CNK not breaking a fairly strong level of support moving forward.\n\nThe last part, admittedly, is a bit of my own opinion. But since the election and Pfizer/Moderna\u2019s vaccine news, there has been a large shift in money across the markets. Specifically, money in the NASDAQ (Covid-proof) tech sector moved outwards towards other sectors, including stocks that were rightfully battered due to Covid. Retail, energy, and entertainment all saw large boosts with Covid relief. You don\u2019t have to look much farther than stocks like Kohl\u2019s (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Airlines (any of them), or cruise lines, all while watching tech largely stagnate (except for beloved meme stocks like Tesla and AMD, of course). Many of these are still trading below their pre-covid highs, and it is where I personally believe large, institutional money is moving and holding large portions of money. Sure, Covid cases are spiking at the moment and there is an argument to be made for the NASDAQ taking up arms again. But the stock market is a forward looking instrument and is now looking ahead to a point in time when Covid has been dealt with.\n\nSo to bring this all full circle, here is my TLDR for why Cinemark is a stock you should seriously consider looking into:\n\n1. It has the financial strength to survive for at least another year, well past the point of covid vaccinations and a return to normalcy.\n2. With AMC on the ropes, CNK could stand to benefit from an increase in market share if AMC does file bankruptcy. They could even pick up existing AMC theaters for significantly cheaper if such a corporate AMC structure were to occur.\n3. While still trading below its pre-Covid highs (and for veritable reason), vaccine news and actual vaccinations only stand to help stocks in the entertainment sector (barring a failed vaccine, of course). And while Covid cases are certainly rising in the short term, because CNK has the financial backing to weather another year, it is a short term headwind that will likely be overtaken when vaccinations ramp up.\n\nPositions? TLDR? Give yourself a year on this one. Buy a leap and leave it for a while. If you hate getting cucked by Theta decay, maybe sell some 10 or 12.5 strike OTM puts. That way, if you end up getting put shares, it\u2019s of a stock you wanted long term anyway (and you got paid to get put into it). Premiums for such a volatile industry and very high right now and there is good money to be made in Theta and Vega.\n\nCNK 15 Jan 2022 20 Bought Call: 4.00 (as of this writing)\n\nCNK 19 March 2021 12.5 Sold Put: 2.40 (as of this writing). With a breakeven of 10.10, this puts you just above support if you do get put. If Cinemark is trading above $12.50 in 3 months time, this is a 19.2% ROI (or 6.4% a month), which is still a hell of a return (especially if you believe in the stock long term, like I do).\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, fiduciary, analyst, nor do I hold any position in a financial company.
