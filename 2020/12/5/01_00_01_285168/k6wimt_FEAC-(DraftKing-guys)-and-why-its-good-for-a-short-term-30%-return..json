A SPAC, In short, is a company that forms for the sole purpose of bringing another company public. The company backing this SPAC is no other than the same which backed Draftkings (Flying Eagle). Flying Eagle\u2019s CEO is Harry Sloan. He has been in the business a long time. He was a founding investor and board member of a company you might have heard of - Bethesda Games. So either he has a great eye for this or he is super lucky - Time will tell. \n\nSkillz is an online mobile multiplayer competition platform that helps developers monetize their games. You likely haven\u2019t heard of most of the games Skillz\u2019s represents, but your grandma probably has. They are: Solitaire Cube, Blackout Bingo, Pool Payday, 21 Blitz and more. All of these are listed on the Apple and Android App Store. All highly rated and with thousands of reviews. The thing that makes them unique vs. other games is that you can 100% legally gamble in them. They accept PayPal and most major credit cards. All withdrawals of winnings can go straight to your bank account. How they managed to get this pass both major App Stores and the US gov I can\u2019t seem to figure out. \n\nNoteworthy Facts:\n1. Forbes named it on its list of the next \u201cBillion dollar start ups\u201d. CNBC named Skillz the \u201cglobal leader in eSports\u201d. \n2. Skillz players averages 65 min per day. To put in perspective, Netflix only averages 50 min per day, per user. \n3. They expect user growth to get into the \u201chundreds of millions within the next two years\u201d. \n4. 10 different SPACS tried to bag Skillz IPO, but they decided to pick Flying Eagle because of Harry Slone\u2019s success. \n5. Financials: Third Quarter Revenue of $60 Million (Up 92% Year-over-Year), Revenue for Year to Date of $162 Million, (Up 91% Over Prior Year). Full Year Revenue expected at $225 Million. \n6.
