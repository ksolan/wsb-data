It's not a  joke company like many other shilled on WSB. Salesforce has a market cap of $200 billion and is one of the 30 companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).\n\n**What Happened**\n\nThis is the price chart for Salesforce (CRM) last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9sqm4nur2a361.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e71b4aee8595c1e3a5a2f1220fedc017c21153f2\n\nThe sharp drop happened right after the earning call. Was the earnings number disappointing? No, in fact, it was stellar. While the average expected EPS was $0.75 per share, the actual number turned out to be $1.74.\n\nBut Salesforce also announced that it's in the process of acquiring Slack (WORK) for 27.7 billion dollars. Some experts said Salesforce is overpaying for Slack and a huge sell-off followed, resulting in a 40 billion drop in Salesforce market cap.\n\nSo, think about it. Salesforce acquires a company for 27.7 billion and its market cap goes down by 40 billion. In other words, 2+2=3, while usually with a merger you expect 2+2=5.\n\n**What Happened Next**\n\nAfter the initial shock, analysts and the public started to reassess the situation, and many actually praised the acquisition.\n\nJim Cramer (the guy who is the WSB for boomers) [said \"Salesforce Has 100% Upside After Buying Slack\"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-salesforce-100-upside-173302345.html). He's been shilling the stock on his show every day as well.\n\nMultiple analysts upgraded their Salesforce recommendation to Strong Buy and raised their price target.\n\nSince then, the initial price gap has been filled a little. The price is currently about $226. But a full recovery to pre-EC prices ($240s) and higher seems imminent.\n\nTraders have a \"3-Day Rule\" according to which they don't touch a stock that has fallen sharply and suddenly for 3 days to let it sink to its lowest and see where it goes from there. Those 3 days for CRM are passed and it seems to be rising.\n\n**What's Coming**\n\n[Salesforce Investor day](https://investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2020/Investor-Day-2020/default.aspx) is on Tuesday (Dec 8) in the morning. They will probably clarify the necessity of the slack acquisition and their plans to profitably integrate it into their core business.\n\nAlso, a lot of institutions see this drop as a good opportunity to get in, so the demand is high.\n\n**What Positions**\n\nDo NOT buy weekly or far OTM options. Consider the following (ranked from riskiest to safest):\n\n\\- 230C 12/18/2020\n\n\\- 250C End of year-February\n\n\\- 270C March-May 2021\n\n\\- 300C June-July 2021\n\n\\- The stock (CRM) if you want to hold for 6 months or more.\n\n**When to Buy**\n\nDo not FOMO. I don't want you to buy in pre-market or when it starts high on Monday and then curse my name when it goes down some in 2 hours.\n\nI think this will certainly go up, both short term and long term,  but there will be dips along the way.
