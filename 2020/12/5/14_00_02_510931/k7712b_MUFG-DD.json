{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "TL;DR: MUFG's price is way under the actual value of the stock. The MUFG $5 2/19/21 Call option at .10 is beyond undervalued.\n\nYesterday, I posted my [gains chart for the past month](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6u2m2/thank_you_all_for_changing_my_life/) where I've consistently been moving up to what amounted to a +780.93% return on investments. I did this through personal research into stocks, statistics, value ratios, and game theory. I've listened to what successful people were doing on this sub and modified it for my own personal strategy.\n\nPeople have been asking what my positions were so I've decided to start doing write ups. I'm currently invested in 12 companies, most which have already made me profits. My strategy is simple, find companies that are very undervalued and compare the risk to reward ratios for the various call options.\n\nToday, I want to tell you about MUFG. \n\n\n**Value Ratios**\n\n\nEarning per share - .24\n\nPrice per Book - .36\n\nProjected Earning Growth - .83\n\nAnnual Dividend is at 5.29%\n\nThese numbers by themselves tell me that the current price of MUFG is way below what the actual value of the stocks are. These value ratios mean that the stock price is heavily incentivized to go up.\n\nThis company has already hit two major floors, one being the major sell-off since it's high at just over $8 down to a floor of around $5, and a floor of $3.43 after the Coronavirus sell-off. I'm not worried about this stock crashing anymore because it has already crashed as hard as it can. It is currently making it's recovery.\n\nIn January, Biden will take over as president and I anticipate many policies will be made to get an actual economic recovery underway. I don't believe this has been priced into MUFG's current price yet. \n\nI understand this is a Japanese company, but we have to understand that the stocks in an American stock market are pushed mainly by American investors. Once more Americans have disposable income, there will be more money thrown into the stock market, and I believe that if the actual value of MUFG doesn't entice investors, it's 5.29% dividend will.\n\nOptions for this stock are pretty low volume. I bought 50 shares of MUFG $5 2/19/21 at an average of .12 per share. This is a price I would expect for a weekly expiration, not one in February. In order to profit, the stock needs to hit $5.13 by 2/19.\n\nThe floor of this stock before the Pandemic was already at $5 and was making a recovery before Covid struck. I don't see how this stock does not eventually go back up to it's floor of $5, if not surpass that floor and go on to $6 or $7.\n\nAgain, at calls prices at .10, I felt that it would be ludicrous to not throw something in and see if I'm right.\n\nAfter it's first major sell off, MUFG hovered around $5 a share before it started going back up. This was stopped by the Coronavirus outbreak, which caused another sell off to $3.43 in March. Ever since then, this stock has been making a slow, but steady climb up.\n\nThe stock has already grown 28% since hitting it's floor in March. It showed recent highs of 4.62 on 11/17 and 11/24. In order for it to hit 5.13, the stock needs to grow just 16.85% more.\n\nUnless something crazy happens, I don't see how this stock doesn't hit at least $5.13 by the time this option expires. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this stock was around $6 or $6.5 by the time all is said and done.\n\nOnce people realize the value of this company, people will buy shares. Once people buy shares, people will realize that the options are valuable. Once people realize that, the price of the option should go up.\n\nFor $12 and option, I am giving myself the opportunity to make a huge return on investment if my math and logic are right. If it doesn't hit, I've really not lost that much money.\n\nHow did I make 780.93% return on the stock market this past month? These are the types of bets I make. I've had more hits than misses, and the hits easily outweigh the misses.\n\nIf you liked this write-up and would like more, I'm happy to present write-ups for some of my other positions. I have call options for TROX (Already up 59.22% with an expiration in 2/19), UNM (bought at .20, up to .53, exp. 3/19), KNOP, LFC, SPTN, GTN, PTVE, AMKR, CS, and TKC. Please fill free to nitpick, ask questions, or shoot my theory down.
