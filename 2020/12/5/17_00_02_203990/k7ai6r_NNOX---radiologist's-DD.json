Keep in mind x-rays have a lot more parts than just the electron gun (target, bucky, brightness control). X-rays are used in radiographs (2D picture), tomosynthesis (fancy x-ray that allows you to determine depth, requires 180degrees view), and CT scans (requires 360degrees view). \n\nWhat did NNOX present?\n\nA human hand radiograph and dummy tomosynthesis using their gun. Nothing I saw was technologically shocking. In fact, I read hundreds of radiographs and dozens of tomo images this week. Side note, him comparing his hand x-ray next to Dr. Rotengen's first medical x-ray from >100years ago was a little tachy, like putting your selfie next to a portrait of jesus. \n\nSentiment\n\nVery few people have heard of them in the professional imaging community.
