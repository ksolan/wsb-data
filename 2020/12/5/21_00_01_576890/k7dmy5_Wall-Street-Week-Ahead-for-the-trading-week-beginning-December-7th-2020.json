{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 7th, 2020.\n\n# **Any progress on stimulus could give the market a boost in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/stimulus-hope-markets-focus-next-week.html)**\n*****\n> Stimulus to help the economy and vaccines to stop the virus are expected to the be the main focus in markets in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Efforts to move along a fiscal package in Congress picked up momentum in the past week with Congressional leaders sounding conciliatory, and a bi-partisan group of senators pushing their own $900 billion proposal.\n*****\n> \u201cIt probably boils down to how much [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is willing to deal, and I don\u2019t know what the answer is to that,\u201d said Mike Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to happen, next week is the week. The government runs out of money on Friday. Congress has to come up with a funding scheme.\u201d\n*****\n> Strategists have said the two events could be tied, but Congress could also push through a spending resolution without including stimulus. Some programs will expire at the end of the month, if Congress does not provide funding, including unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.\n*****\n> The on again, off again stimulus talks have led to skepticism in the market, and sets it up for a move higher if there is anything officially announced. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s fully baked in. I would say the stimulus is a positive catalyst, unless it\u2019s less than $900 billion,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.\n*****\n> While stocks surged in the past week, bond yields also moved higher. Yields move opposite price, and bond yields have been rising on stimulus expectations. More spending means more debt, and that sends rates higher.\n*****\n> The 10-year was at 0.97% Friday, and appeared ready to move back to the 1% level for the first time since March.\n*****\n> \u201cIs it the case here, stimulus is already factored in, and will people take their money and run?\u201d said Schumacher.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 gained 1.7% in the past week, ending Friday at 3,699, a record high. The Dow also ended up 1% at a record 30,218, and Nasdaq gained 2.1% to a record 12,464.\n*****\n> # Getting jabbed\n> Vaccine news has been a catalyst for the market\u2019s surge since early November, when Pfizer first revealed the high efficacy of its vaccine. Since then Moderna and Astra-Zeneca both revealed results of their own vaccines.\n*****\n> A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meets Thursday on emergency use authorization for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine.\n*****\n> \u201cThey\u2019re starting to roll it out in the U.K, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be watched here to see how it unfolds,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist Prudential Financial. \u201cThat\u2019s the next issue for the market. The deliveries, the distributions. Are people being jabbed? These are all questions the market is concerned about about because they\u2019re looking forward to it unrolling smoothly in the U.S.\u201d\n*****\n> About 3 million people will be vaccinated in the initial rollout. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is expected to be approved the following week, and by year-end both vaccines are expected to reach 20 million people in the U.S.\n*****\n> \u201cThe vaccine news has started to see a bit of diminishing return in terms of its wow factor,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some volatility around the logistics.\u201d\n*****\n> Krosby said the virus remains in the forefront for the market because of the continuing spread and its economic impact as activities are shut down. California Thursday announced new restrictions with stay at home advisories in some regions.\n*****\n> \u201cThe big question is how long does the Covid surge last?\u201d Krosby said.\n*****\n> The virus shutdowns appear to be behind a slowdown in the labor market, and economists say it could slow activity into the first quarter. November job growth of 245,000 was about 200,000 less than expected. That makes Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims more important for markets.\n*****\n> There is also CPI and PPI inflation data Thursday and Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cThere is this push pull in the market regarding inflationary pressures,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cIt\u2019s not expected, which is why if it does print higher, it could ignite the conversation regarding inflation.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PZEBIS8.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ypJI3Vy.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/s01kzjN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/7Y1RKiX.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nF9LHWm.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/F99YkSI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/00G6LqZ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8OK0Nmw.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tgMnGUY.png))**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PDrxDY8.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5rCf9oe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/VsZzlKU.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/moiEQsJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Stocks and Bonds Both in Rally Mode\n\n> When it comes to equity market performance in a given month, it doesn't get much better than November. While the S&P 500's total return of 10.95% in the month was only the second-best monthly performance of the year, it was still enough to rank as the third-best month for the S&P 500 in the last thirty years and just the ninth month since 1980 that it was up 10%+.\n\n> The chart below shows the S&P 500's annualized total return over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares the current returns to the historical average. For the last year, the S&P 500's total return has been 17.5% which is nearly six full percentage points higher than the historical average. For the last two years, the annualized return has been nearly as strong at 16.8%, and it is actually even stronger relative to the historical average of 10.5%. Moving further out the time horizon, the S&P 500's annualized returns drift lower, and while the five and ten-year annualized returns are greater than average, the S&P 500's annualized gain of 7.3% in the last 20 years is more than 3.5 percentage points below the historical average of 10.9%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-SP-500-Act-vs-Avg.png))**\n\n> The last couple of years haven't just been strong for equities. Over the last year, long-term US Treasuries, as measured by the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Treasury Index, have rallied 15.7%, which is more than six full percentage points greater than the historical average of 9.5%. Over the last two years, returns have been even stronger with an annualized gain of nearly 20%, or more than double the historical average of 9.1%! While the last two years have been strong for US Treasuries, the last five, ten, and twenty years have all seen returns of between one and two percentage points below their historical average.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120LT-Treas-Act-vs-Avg.png))**\n\n> Lately, when you see rallies in the equity market, it tends to be accompanied by a decline in treasuries as yields rise. In November, though, that wasn't the case. Even with the S&P 500 up 10.95%, long-term US Treasuries rallied just over 1%. So how uncommon is it for stocks to rally like they did in November while bonds also rally. Actually, it is not very uncommon at all. The table below shows the nine months since 1980 where the S&P 500's total return in a given month was 10% or more, and of those months, long-term treasuies also rallied in every month but one (October 2011).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-Stocks-Up-10.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Manufacturer Recovery Continues\n\n> This morning, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a less positive outlook for the US manufacturing sector. The headline number for ISM's Manufacturing index fell from 59.3 last month down to 57.5. A drop was expected, but the actual results were worse than the drop to 58.0 that had been forecasted. That reading indicates that the manufacturing sector continued to grow in November but at a slower rate than October.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Headline.png))**\n\n> Similar to the various Federal Reserve bank surveys from around the country, breadth in the November report was more negative than in recent months. Of the ten indices excluding the headline number, only three were higher in November: Backlog Orders, Supplier Deliveries, and Export Orders. Additionally, two indices\u2014Customer Inventories and Employment\u2014showed contractionary readings.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Table1.png))**\n\n> One theme of the report was that orders remain very healthy. New Orders fell from 67.9 to 65.1, but that is a sixth consecutive month of expansionary readings. Although the index was lower this month, meaning new order growth decelerated, it remains in the top decile of historical readings. As new orders have continued to grow, so too have backlogs. The index for Backlog Orders has continued to press higher, rising to 56.9 from 55.7. That is in the 88th percentile of all months and is now at the highest level since August of 2018. Demand continues to improve with new orders coming in at a historically strong pace, even though it is slower than last month, and order backlogs have once again risen as a result.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Orders.png))**\n\n> As new order growth decelerated, so too did production. The index fell from 63.0 in October to 60.8 last month. That is still consistent with growth (readings above 50) in production but at the slowest rate since June. One factor that potentially had an impact on the slowdown in production is issues with suppliers. The index for Supplier Deliveries rose for the fourth month in a row in November and reached the highest level since May. Higher readings in the Supplier Deliveries index indicates longer lead times and vice versa. In other words, products from suppliers have been taking longer to reach manufacturers, in turn, impacting productivity.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Prod-Supp.png))**\n\n> Although suppliers appear to have some constraints and production has slowed slightly, business inventories rose for the second month in a row even as more and more firms report that customer inventories are too low. The index for Customer Inventories now sits in the bottom 2% of historical readings after dropping another 0.4 points in November. At 36.3, the index is at the lowest level since June of 2010. That low reading can be considered positive for future production.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Inventorie.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Big Gains In November Steal From Santa\n\n> What a month November was! Here are some of the highlights:\n\n> * Best month for Dow since January 1987 (11.9%) and best November since 1928\n> * Best month ever for the STOXX 600 (16.7%)\n> * Best month ever for the Russell 2000 (18.3%)\n> * Best month for the S&P 500 (10.8%) and Nasdaq (11.8%) since April 2020\n> * Best month for Dow Transports since October 2011 (12.1%)\n> * Best month from PHLX Semiconductor Index since March 2003 (18.4%)\n> * Best month for Industrials (16.0%) and Financials (16.8%) since April 2009\n> * Second best month ever for energy (28.0%)\n\n> A way better than expected earnings season, a likely split Congress, and major breakthroughs on the vaccine front all helped stocks soar last month,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAdd ongoing support from the Federal Reserve as the cherry on top and we are looking at a truly historic month on many levels.\u201d\n\n> Here\u2019s all the Dow monthly returns since 1900. Last month was the best return since January 1987. Now before you go out and sell because you see 1987, remember the S&P 500 added another 20% the seven months after the huge gains in early 1987.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> It was the best November for the S&P 500 since November 1928.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Small caps soared on the likelihood of taxes staying lower due to a divided Congress and vaccine progress, with the Russell 2000 adding more than 18% for the best month ever, topping the previous record from February 2000.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> What happens after a big month? Well, history says a 10% monthly gain is quite bullish. In fact, we had a 10% plus rally back in April 2020 and shared this same chart at that time. Sure enough, returns have been strong this time around as well. \u201cThe bottom line is the huge gains in November could actually be the start of something much stronger,\u201d according to Ryan Detrick. \u201cAlso, this was the second month of 2020 with a 10% gain. The only other year to do that? 1982, which kicked off a historic bull market.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Turning to December, this month is widely known to be quite bullish, as Santa comes to town, people feel good, and stocks tend to do well. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1950, December has been the second best month of the year, with only November better. December had been the best month of the year until the historic 9.2% drop in 2018. As a result, December hasn\u2019t been quite as strong over the past 10 and 20 years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Breaking it down even more, a big rally in November can potentially steal some of December\u2019s thunder. As after a 5% or 10% rally in November, the returns in December are more muted. The flipside to this though is if the S&P 500 is up more than 10% for the year (like 2020), then stocks have benefited from some performance chasing and have tended to do better.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> What does it all mean? After the historic move in November we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see below average returns in December. We do believe this is a new bull market and lasting economic cycle of growth, but overall sentiment is getting quite stretched and this increases the potential for some near-term weakness.

The government runs out of money on Friday. Congress has to come up with a funding scheme.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Strategists have said the two events could be tied, but Congress could also push through a spending resolution without including stimulus. Some programs will expire at the end of the month, if Congress does not provide funding, including unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The on again, off again stimulus talks have led to skepticism in the market, and sets it up for a move higher if there is anything officially announced. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s fully baked in. I would say the stimulus is a positive catalyst, unless it\u2019s less than $900 billion,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>While stocks surged in the past week, bond yields also moved higher. Yields move opposite price, and bond yields have been rising on stimulus expectations. More spending means more debt, and that sends rates higher.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The 10-year was at 0.97% Friday, and appeared ready to move back to the 1% level for the first time since March.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>\u201cIs it the case here, stimulus is already factored in, and will people take their money and run?\u201d said Schumacher.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.7% in the past week, ending Friday at 3,699, a record high. The Dow also ended up 1% at a record 30,218, and Nasdaq gained 2.1% to a record 12,464.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>Getting jabbed</h1>\n\n<p>Vaccine news has been a catalyst for the market\u2019s surge since early November, when Pfizer first revealed the high efficacy of its vaccine. Since then Moderna and Astra-Zeneca both revealed results of their own vaccines.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meets Thursday on emergency use authorization for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re starting to roll it out in the U.K, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be watched here to see how it unfolds,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist Prudential Financial. \u201cThat\u2019s the next issue for the market. The deliveries, the distributions. Are people being jabbed? These are all questions the market is concerned about about because they\u2019re looking forward to it unrolling smoothly in the U.S.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>About 3 million people will be vaccinated in the initial rollout. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is expected to be approved the following week, and by year-end both vaccines are expected to reach 20 million people in the U.S.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>\u201cThe vaccine news has started to see a bit of diminishing return in terms of its wow factor,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some volatility around the logistics.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Krosby said the virus remains in the forefront for the market because of the continuing spread and its economic impact as activities are shut down. California Thursday announced new restrictions with stay at home advisories in some regions.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>\u201cThe big question is how long does the Covid surge last?\u201d Krosby said.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The virus shutdowns appear to be behind a slowdown in the labor market, and economists say it could slow activity into the first quarter. November job growth of 245,000 was about 200,000 less than expected. That makes Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims more important for markets.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>There is also CPI and PPI inflation data Thursday and Friday.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>\u201cThere is this push pull in the market regarding inflationary pressures,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cIt\u2019s not expected, which is why if it does print higher, it could ignite the conversation regarding inflation.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr/>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1><strong>This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/PZEBIS8.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices for this past week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/ypJI3Vy.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Futures Markets as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/s01kzjN.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/7Y1RKiX.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/nF9LHWm.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/F99YkSI.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/00G6LqZ.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a></strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/8OK0Nmw.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/tgMnGUY.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)</p>\n\n<h1><strong>Here are the upcoming IPO&#39;s for this week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/PDrxDY8.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Friday&#39;s Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/5rCf9oe.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/VsZzlKU.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/moiEQsJ.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Stocks and Bonds Both in Rally Mode</h1>\n\n<p>When it comes to equity market performance in a given month, it doesn&#39;t get much better than November. While the S&amp;P 500&#39;s total return of 10.95% in the month was only the second-best monthly performance of the year, it was still enough to rank as the third-best month for the S&amp;P 500 in the last thirty years and just the ninth month since 1980 that it was up 10%+.</p>\n\n<p>The chart below shows the S&amp;P 500&#39;s annualized total return over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares the current returns to the historical average. For the last year, the S&amp;P 500&#39;s total return has been 17.5% which is nearly six full percentage points higher than the historical average. For the last two years, the annualized return has been nearly as strong at 16.8%, and it is actually even stronger relative to the historical average of 10.5%. Moving further out the time horizon, the S&amp;P 500&#39;s annualized returns drift lower, and while the five and ten-year annualized returns are greater than average, the S&amp;P 500&#39;s annualized gain of 7.3% in the last 20 years is more than 3.5 percentage points below the historical average of 10.9%.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-SP-500-Act-vs-Avg.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>The last couple of years haven&#39;t just been strong for equities. Over the last year, long-term US Treasuries, as measured by the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Treasury Index, have rallied 15.7%, which is more than six full percentage points greater than the historical average of 9.5%. Over the last two years, returns have been even stronger with an annualized gain of nearly 20%, or more than double the historical average of 9.1%! While the last two years have been strong for US Treasuries, the last five, ten, and twenty years have all seen returns of between one and two percentage points below their historical average.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120LT-Treas-Act-vs-Avg.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Lately, when you see rallies in the equity market, it tends to be accompanied by a decline in treasuries as yields rise. In November, though, that wasn&#39;t the case. Even with the S&amp;P 500 up 10.95%, long-term US Treasuries rallied just over 1%. So how uncommon is it for stocks to rally like they did in November while bonds also rally. Actually, it is not very uncommon at all. The table below shows the nine months since 1980 where the S&amp;P 500&#39;s total return in a given month was 10% or more, and of those months, long-term treasuies also rallied in every month but one (October 2011).</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-Stocks-Up-10.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Manufacturer Recovery Continues</h1>\n\n<p>This morning, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a less positive outlook for the US manufacturing sector. The headline number for ISM&#39;s Manufacturing index fell from 59.3 last month down to 57.5. A drop was expected, but the actual results were worse than the drop to 58.0 that had been forecasted. That reading indicates that the manufacturing sector continued to grow in November but at a slower rate than October.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Headline.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Similar to the various Federal Reserve bank surveys from around the country, breadth in the November report was more negative than in recent months. Of the ten indices excluding the headline number, only three were higher in November: Backlog Orders, Supplier Deliveries, and Export Orders. Additionally, two indices\u2014Customer Inventories and Employment\u2014showed contractionary readings.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Table1.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>One theme of the report was that orders remain very healthy. New Orders fell from 67.9 to 65.1, but that is a sixth consecutive month of expansionary readings. Although the index was lower this month, meaning new order growth decelerated, it remains in the top decile of historical readings. As new orders have continued to grow, so too have backlogs. The index for Backlog Orders has continued to press higher, rising to 56.9 from 55.7. That is in the 88th percentile of all months and is now at the highest level since August of 2018. Demand continues to improve with new orders coming in at a historically strong pace, even though it is slower than last month, and order backlogs have once again risen as a result.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Orders.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>As new order growth decelerated, so too did production. The index fell from 63.0 in October to 60.8 last month. That is still consistent with growth (readings above 50) in production but at the slowest rate since June. One factor that potentially had an impact on the slowdown in production is issues with suppliers. The index for Supplier Deliveries rose for the fourth month in a row in November and reached the highest level since May. Higher readings in the Supplier Deliveries index indicates longer lead times and vice versa. In other words, products from suppliers have been taking longer to reach manufacturers, in turn, impacting productivity.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Prod-Supp.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Although suppliers appear to have some constraints and production has slowed slightly, business inventories rose for the second month in a row even as more and more firms report that customer inventories are too low. The index for Customer Inventories now sits in the bottom 2% of historical readings after dropping another 0.4 points in November. At 36.3, the index is at the lowest level since June of 2010. That low reading can be considered positive for future production.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Inventorie.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Big Gains In November Steal From Santa</h1>\n\n<p>What a month November was!

As a result, December hasn\u2019t been quite as strong over the past 10 and 20 years.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Breaking it down even more, a big rally in November can potentially steal some of December\u2019s thunder. As after a 5% or 10% rally in November, the returns in December are more muted. The flipside to this though is if the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 10% for the year (like 2020), then stocks have benefited from some performance chasing and have tended to do better.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>What does it all mean? After the historic move in November we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see below average returns in December. We do believe this is a new bull market and lasting economic cycle of growth, but overall sentiment is getting quite stretched and this increases the potential for some near-term weakness.
