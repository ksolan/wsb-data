Newsflash -- they don't even compete in the same market anymore, boomer!! They haven't been competing in the same market since 2013, as they quietly pivot from hardware to software. \n\nIn short, Blackberry is now a software company, who has a powerful operating system, QNX, which is used in Audi, BMW, Jaguar, Land Rover, and Toyota cars. BlackBerry just partnered with Amazon to develop BlackBerry IVY, which collects a multitude of vehicle data from all these manufacturers. Yes, it is true that Tesla has a HUGE advantage over any other single (keyword: single) automobile manufacturer when it comes to driving and road data, but what happens when you consolidate EVERYONE ELSE who is frothing to beat Tesla for vehicle and road data? BB's data (scaling with AWS) will absolutely catch up and crush TSLA's.\n\nHold on it gets better. BB ALSO does cybersecurity with US FedRAMP certifications, which allows the US government to use their end to end solution for secure communications. They also own AtHoc, which has been crushing it for COVID crisis communications for universities, hospitals, and Fortune 500 companies, including a partnership with ServiceNow for incident management tracking, and in Microsoft Teams for enterprise communications. For a cybersecurity comparison, Crowdstrike (CRWD) trades at a price-to-sales ratio of roughly 40x, Palo Alto Networks at about \\~8x. BB \"only\" make 800-1b annually and growing, (about what Palantir makes), and is **only** trading at 3.3x sales. If someone can give me DD on why CRWD will eat BB's lunch, I will eat my socks if BB doesn't eventually float up closer to these valuations.\n\n If this company were rebranded RaspBerry and fresh IPOing today you bet your ass it would instantly be a 30 to 50bill market cap company.
