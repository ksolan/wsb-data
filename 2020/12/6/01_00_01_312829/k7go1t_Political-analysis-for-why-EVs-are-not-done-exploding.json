I am approaching this analysis from a political and policy standpoint - so my analysis of individual EV companies will be limited but is meant to provide a bullish outlook for why regulations will be placed on fuel economy standards and what that means for the future of the auto industry.   \n\n\n**BACKGROUND**  \nThe transportation sector is responsible for majority of climate change driven emissions in the United States. Within the transportation sector, majority of the emissions comes from light-duty vehicles (LDV) which dominate the overall fleet numbers. However, although the medium and heavy duty vehicle (MHDV) fleets comprise a tiny percentage of the overall US fleet, they disproportionately contribute over 50% of NOx emissions.   \n\n\nBecause of this, there is increased pressure to accelerate EV adoption both in the LDV and MHDV sectors. How will this be done?\n\n* Incentives (rebates, tax credits, installation)\n* Regulations (fuel economy, ZEV mandates)\n\nUnfortunately, none of the incentives or regulations have gained much traction under Trump, who has been anti-climate and pro oil and gas, Under Trump, the EPA attacked California and revoked their state authority to set higher greenhouse gas emissions standards than federal ones. Under the Clean Air Act, Section 177, states are given the authority to do this but the EPA must grant them a waiver to do so. There is ongoing litigation on this issue. GM, Toyota, and Fiat-Chrysler [sided](https://apnews.com/article/bb5788e2e8d84a488599c62f8006ca97) with Trump on this issue. GM recently left the lawsuit when Biden won. \n\nTrump also rolled back the strongest climate policy on the books, which was Obama's Fuel Economy standards. The Obama standards end goal was 54.5 MPG Fuel efficiency and would have limited climate-disrupting pollution by 6 billion tons, save consumers $1.7 trillion dollars in fuel costs, and reduce oil consumption by up to 4 million barrels a day.\u00a0 As part of the rollback - Trump instituted his own fuel economy rules called the SAFE rule - which has been deemed inadequate by both environmental and auto groups. \n\n**WHAT IS BIDEN GOING TO DO?** \n\nJoe Biden has the most ambitious climate agenda in modern history. His proposal costs 90x more than what Obama had proposed. With the US falling behind in emissions reduction - the administration knows they need to act fast, aggressive, and be bold. \n\nUpon entering office on Jan 20, Joe Biden in his first 100 days will make sweeping executive changes and orders that will affect the auto industry and boost EV adoption. \n\n* He will rollback the Trump rollbacks of California's authority and the Obama Clean Car standards.\n* The EPA will grant California their authority back to enforce their LDV standards (14 other states have already adopted the California LDV standards). \n* The EPA will also grant California their authority to enforce their new [Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT)](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/advanced-clean-trucks-fact-sheet) rule, which they just proposed and adopted this past summer, which will require manufacturers to increase their electric MHDV sales to be 30-50 percent by 2030. Other states are going to adopt this California truck standard. \n* **He will institute a National EV Mandate.** The details of this are unclear so far as to how he will do this - but it will be subtle. There won't be a regulation or requirement for 100% EV sales or total fleet turnover by a certain year (I could be wrong but it would be harder to push through). What I think they will do is they will build upon the Obama Fuel Economy standards of 54.5 MPG, and propose and adopt a rule for an MPG standard that is strong enough that **ONLY EVS will meet those requirements** and the cost to produce gas vehicles at such high standards will incentivize EV adoption and deter automakers from producing gas vehicles. Effectively an EV mandate, but not in name. \n* He will invest 500,000 charging stations across the country\n\n**WHAT ARE POTENTIAL ROADBLOCKS?** \n\n* Some Automakers: The EV market is still very nascent and EVs represent a very very small portion of overall vehicle sales. Some automakers are still incentivized to sell gas vehicles since that's what the majority of consumers want. Other automakers recognize that if they don't switch to EVs soon - Daddy Elon Musk is going to own the world \n* Consumers: Lack of charging stations, battery range, low supply of EVs, and general misinformation against EVs are currently deterring consumers from making the switch\n* Labor: There are over 1.7 million jobs in the auto industry, majority of which work for the Big 3 American automakers who are slow on transitioning towards EVs. EVs are easier to manufacture and produce and require less workers. They also require less service and repair. The autoworkers union is heavily invested in making sure jobs are not lost in this transition towards EVs\n* Dealers: The dealer model is under direct attack from EV manufacturers who directly sell to consumers. Additionally, majority of the revenue for dealers does NOT come from selling vehicles, but it comes from service and maintenance of cars. EVs save consumers  thousands of dollars less annually on service and maintenance\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\n* EVs are the future. The Biden EV plan will spur EV adoption and transform the industry. Both the  LDV and MHDV sectors will be under pressure due to regulation and climate goals to go electric.
