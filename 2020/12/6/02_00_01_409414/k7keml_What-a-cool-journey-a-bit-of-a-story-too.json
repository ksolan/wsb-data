I DIDNT EVEN KNOW WHAT DOLLAR COST AVERAGING WAS LOOOOOOLLL.\n\n\n\nFAST FORWARD: in september I tried yoloing into about 5-6 different monthlies, got spy calls fedex calls and amd calls, lucky for me I managed to panic sell my amd oct calls when i had about 2 months on them and they eventually went on to be 400% returners, feeling a bit discouraged I decided to keep trading and not realize that I was being a real loser and everything I was doing was wrong, went on to play a lot of spy weeklies id just realize losses on... but there was something hidden in the light... NIO oh my god.. so with NIO I purchased leaps( when jt was trading around $40) the ONE time I decide not to buy monthlies, anyway I remember the next few days seeing $1000-2000 gains but i tell myself im going to hold, its a fucking leap (they were Jan 21 2022 44c 4x) my entire acc was in them, I was up around $8000 on Nov 13 I thought I was unstoppable and that.. was the day NIO went down 25% I kept watching it go down and decided to panic sell and realize a $200 loss because of wide bid ask spreads. HOWEVER the most awesome part? so I learned a bit about theta gang and SOLD a nio 50c the day prior EXPIRING the day the stock skyrocketed up to $54 I bought back the call to realize a $500 loss in the morning and nio made sure to drop 25% that day after, \n\n\nI also bought a few PLTR calls when it was around 10 $14 expiring 12/18 and if I had simply sold a few and let the rest ride I wouldve doubled my acc but instead I realized small gains \n\n\n\n\nOVERALL i am pretty excited and happy for what ive learned, just try to be more intelligent and make logical plays, let your winners ride, if youre panicing over an amount you probably shouldnt trade with that, and yeah\n\n\nPOSITIONS \n\nFDX calls\nSPY calls \nAMD calls\nNIO leaps \nPLTR calls\n\n\nCURRENT positions\n\nSQ calls\nICLN calls\nROKU calls", "author_fullname": "t2_7nkiyv8l", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What a cool journey a bit of a story too", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Loss"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "loss", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_k7keml", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Loss", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1607219520.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1607247834.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/StKuWox\">Losses</a></p>\n\n<p>Okay so im gonna be honest im a complete dumbass, I started trading around near the end of August, first ever share purchased was 2 tesla shares of course($470) at the time, I knew about options and wanted to jump in but thought id test the water with shares, I also picked up 15 apple shares ($132) I also did the logical and sustainable thing that all successful traders do, check your account every 5 minutes to make sure dopamine is constantly being injected in ur brain when you see the stock move up (a very healthy habit).</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward two days its SEPTEMBEAR and my shares are all down, no worries though im doing the intelligent thing and PANIC SELLING my TSLA making sure to realize over $200 in losses, the next month or so I do nothing, until one day I decide ok its time to throw all my money into apple, I buy 50 shares at $116 and IMMEDIATELY i decide u know what nvm i wanna free up capital, bro I sold 50 shares and was confused when I realized a $500 loss I thought to myself, uh... whatbhappened?
