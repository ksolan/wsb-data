For example, anything related to EVs, business in space, quantum computing, or any highly disruptive technology will pump hard based on any news that makes it closer to reality. Once reality sets in and products are on the market (assuming there aren&#39;t more reasons to speculate, ie tsla&#39;s situation), that is when the real valuations take effect (ie crash of dot com). My guess is if any of their pre clinical work makes it to clinical trial they will run hard, just like CRSP did.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7i26g/crsp_is_going_to_run_hard_monday_morning_their/geradnv/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_geradnv", "created": 1607244229.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1607215429.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "replies": []}]}, {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_k7i26g", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gerxe2s", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": {"name": "BenjaminFernwood", "fullname": "t2_14ks5y"}, "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1607226937.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ger371v", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_14ks5y", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "body": "You at the Broad Institute or somewhere else?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "ANAL GoD"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>You at the Broad Institute or somewhere else?</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7i26g/crsp_is_going_to_run_hard_monday_morning_their/gerxe2s/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_gerxe2s", "created": 1607255737.0, "author_flair_text": "ANAL GoD", "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "replies": []}]}]}, {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 4, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_k7i26g", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gerav3i", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "author": {"name": "don_tmind_me", "fullname": "t2_x1jj2"}, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_k7i26g", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_x1jj2", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "body": "I bought 50 shares at 80 and played around with weeklies when it spiked around the Nobel prize news.
