It should lead to 5 millions smokers quitting within a year. It also prevents new generations from developing the nicotine addiction through cigarettes. XXII is the only company with the science to do this. Putting in place a nicotine mandate would require all of the tobacco companies to work with xxii to produce their own tobacco with very low nicotine. This would tremendously increase value to xxii stock. I am expecting xxii to call attention to this article. Wouldn't be surprised to see a nice green day on monday.\n\nCEO Jim Mish made a presentation at a fall investors summit. Here he talked about how he feels this stock is one of the most undervalued stocks on the market, and talked about how MRTP approval has potential to multiply market cap by 10x or greater. 'woefully undervalued'. MRTP approval is inevitable could come any day now. He describes the nicotine mandate mentioned in the Atlantic article above as a 'grand slam' for xxii, and the MRTP approval a 'home run'.\n\nHere is a link to the PDF of the presentation- [https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_fe5f861ad8948b35cfe27b4182b3b179/xxiicentury/db/264/2208/presentation/22nd+Century+Fall+Virtual+Investor+Summit+Final+3+PM.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_fe5f861ad8948b35cfe27b4182b3b179/xxiicentury/db/264/2208/presentation/22nd+Century+Fall+Virtual+Investor+Summit+Final+3+PM.pdf)\n\nAnd a link to the webcast - [https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2038/38897](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2038/38897)\n\nA few days after the above presentation, he purchased 100k shares of xxii at $.93. This caused a big increase in share price.\n\nCEO Jim Mish also presented at the Cowen Cannabis Conference (virtual). This was to talk about both the tobacco and cannabis sides of the business. The tobacco side there wasn't too much of an update, just giving another audience the perspective of the company. On the cannabis side, he did say they have collected quite a variety of IP for cannabis, particularly for THC and other isolated/combined cannabinoids, and he said they want to start monetizing what they have in 2021.\n\nLink to the video presentation in this tweet - [https://twitter.com/\\_xxiicentury/status/1334232944634945542](https://twitter.com/_xxiicentury/status/1334232944634945542)\n\nTheir main focus has been nicotine and tobacco, but as of late their cannabis side has been pushing along. They have retail investments on the Panacea side and genomic/IP investments on their own and with KeyGene.\n\nIn addition to all of this which, on it's own is extremely exciting, they have a third plant-based venture to announce, noting that this third plant has many genomic similarities to the cannabis plant and also that the three plants (tobacco, cannabis, TBD..) are synergetic. This leads me to believe the third plant line has to do with hops. Just a guess.\n\nMish has been hyper focused on the mission of getting MRTP approved, pushing to get the cannabis side of the business making money, and getting investors on board. He has been setting up near bi-weekly conference calls like the LD micro 500. Just spreading the word and letting people know we are primed to go as soon as the FDA gives us the OK to market properly.\n\nThanks for reading and let me know if you have any questions or comments.", "author_fullname": "t2_i6izp", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "XXII (plant bio-tech focused on tobacco & cannabis) DD round 1.5", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_k7nuxc", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1607261678.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>First DD found in link below - This stock is up over 100% since I posted this ~1 month ago.
