Having stretched your $1,200 Trump bucks as far as possible, you\u2019ve begun considering cashing in and seeing if there\u2019s a market for Sheriff Woody on OnlyFans.

That\u2019s right, good old Tom got a job working for $GME Stop, and they\u2019re hiring people just like you. After a quick 5 minute conversation, you\u2019ve got a new job. Even better, the company respects your rights, given by God, and doesn\u2019t require you wear a mask or submit to humiliating \u201chealth and wellness\u201d checks every morning like Biden supporters and the Fake News love to do.\n> \n> Much like investors in $GME Stop\u2019s stock, you\u2019ve hit the jackpot.

While most retailers were grossly unprepared to handle the drop in sales and health risks associated with this event, $GME Stop had nothing to lose. In a world where swans are black and coronavirus is fake, $GME Stop has ignored health and safety recommendations, putting shareholder value first while competitors have been duped and distracted by fads such as face masks and toilet paper. Furthermore, $GME Stop has been a bastion of hope for other brick and mortar retailers to aspire to - with more than one PS5 in stock on Black Friday unlike the other stores near me like Best Buy ($BBY) or Target ($TGT) who \u201cdiscouraged\u201d us from camping out and \u201crequired\u201d face coverings on threat of expulsion.\n\nWith new VR and 3D TV technologies on the horizon, and the rise of Mobile Gaming, institutions are sure to be clamoring for $GME Stop shares after earnings on Tuesday. It\u2019s undeniable, millions of Americans are sitting at home and the demand for adult entertainment has only continued to grow during these difficult times.
