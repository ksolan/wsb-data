It is not. You can use any benchmark you want. So for instance let's say you're in tech and you choose to use QQQ as your benchmark. This means that if QQQ were to go up 150% in a year you needed to choose stocks that went up more than that in the same year in the same sector because the basket is the average of however many companies.\n\nLet's say that you chose Tesla in 2020. The excess return is known as *alpha* and this means that when you went up 500 percent the *alpha* (this is very simplistic) is basically 350%, 500 - 150, so a lot of people do recognize that they can indeed beat their benchmarks but more often than not you will not. If you chose Tesla last year or the year prior and so forth it was relatively flat compared to QQQ which also had Amazon and Apple and other larger names in tech plus smaller names that actually are still strong companies that are growing.\n\nSo with the background here is the way that the index fund concept works:\n\n**Across time the** ***beta*** **often defeats those seeking** ***alpha***. Now this is a fact. Most \"active managers\" do not do very well across time, and the key thing is the phrase \"across time\", because these market figures that are used in this argument are measured in decades. This is important but complicated to explain because you have to actually be terribly interested in peeling back Financial History to get into it but the entire premise of the Efficient Market Hypothesis meeting with the Modern Portfolio Theory and the birth of the Index Fund is that in a real world (that is, a world with fees), you don't do better trying to seek alpha. Most individuals do not have the time, skill, interest or ability to seek alpha.\n\nNow this is also important: ***Alpha is not to be mistaken for Profits and Gains***\\*.\\* So that run up of 200% you made is *not* alpha. You did *not* beat the market because you made 2x your money and the broad market only returned 30% that year. In fact after you do an analysis usually about 80% of that 2x is actually *beta*. This also fuels the argument that index funds are better overall for most people; you just own it all, you let the market work, you let the world work at large, and you don't really have to mistake gains that you make for brilliance when in fact it's just a normal status of the rising tide lifting the boats.\n\nOn the opposing end you have active investors:\n\nThese are the people who seek *alpha*. I will say that about 90% of the statements I hear regarding this are completely incorrect. Most people mistake profits for alpha, so for instance, if you held Tesla for the last ten years and then 2020 shows up you look like a financial genius but the truth is (unfortunately) you got really, really lucky. For 9 of the ten years (actually 20 of the 21 or so) Tesla grew very, very slowly if at all. Now this is where I am going to explain active investing in two parts; the first is the \"retail / layman\" version and the second is the \"hedge fund / manager\" version.\n\nRetail version: Most people who are in retail are going to tell you that the stocks that they picked turned out and it was not luck. If you tell someone \"God, you're a moron\" for buying Tesla *today* you're the moron, but if you told them that 10 years ago, you were probably right, and frankly the reasoning for this is hindsight bias. Retail has a lot of psychological problems ranging from hindsight to fear-of-missing-out, very emotional as a group, and is riddle with cognitive biases such as mental accounting and believing they are from Lake Woebegone. Most of retail believes that the taking of high profits *is* alpha and that is just false. I could go on for hours but there are plenty of papers by scholars like Andrew Lo of MIT which explain this pretty clearly or Charlie Munger who named many of the cognitive biases.\n\nHedge Fund version: When a hedge fund seeks *alpha* is distinctly creating a strategy that deviates from the returns of the market at large. This is incredibly difficult to do. This is not equivalent to just stock picking; one of the most famous hedge fund managers in the world, Warren Buffet, is *not* just a stock picker. In fact his model for cashflow (using insurance premiums and large lump-sum encouraged industries) is ingenious and just about never talked about because everyone is focused on his returns and not on the method by which he finances those returns. We can talk about Lynch, Taleb, Dalio, Soros and even Simons and come out with a large number of varying genius ways to finance their own outfits but ultimately it is incorrect to assume that it is simply a matter of stock picking.\n\nFinding a method by which one can deviate from the beta of the market and produce excessive returns, esp. in the modern market, is getting harder. One of the principles of old, value investing, and actually it's counterpart, growth investing, are beginning to wane in ability to be viable particularly because technology is moving faster than ever, the business cycle is becoming significantly shorter, education is widespread so actual entrepreneurship is more widely available which results in worse competition and the fact that information is so available that finding \"gems in the rough\" is quite difficult. Hedge Funds aim specifically to deviate from beta more or less as protection so you wouldn't just put all your money into a hedge fund, not that you couldn't, but in general they are for wealthier individuals to diversify.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is probably too long and no one will read it.

Most people mistake profits for alpha, so for instance, if you held Tesla for the last ten years and then 2020 shows up you look like a financial genius but the truth is (unfortunately) you got really, really lucky. For 9 of the ten years (actually 20 of the 21 or so) Tesla grew very, very slowly if at all. Now this is where I am going to explain active investing in two parts; the first is the &quot;retail / layman&quot; version and the second is the &quot;hedge fund / manager&quot; version.</p>\n\n<p>Retail version: Most people who are in retail are going to tell you that the stocks that they picked turned out and it was not luck. If you tell someone &quot;God, you&#39;re a moron&quot; for buying Tesla <em>today</em> you&#39;re the moron, but if you told them that 10 years ago, you were probably right, and frankly the reasoning for this is hindsight bias. Retail has a lot of psychological problems ranging from hindsight to fear-of-missing-out, very emotional as a group, and is riddle with cognitive biases such as mental accounting and believing they are from Lake Woebegone. Most of retail believes that the taking of high profits <em>is</em> alpha and that is just false. I could go on for hours but there are plenty of papers by scholars like Andrew Lo of MIT which explain this pretty clearly or Charlie Munger who named many of the cognitive biases.</p>\n\n<p>Hedge Fund version: When a hedge fund seeks <em>alpha</em> is distinctly creating a strategy that deviates from the returns of the market at large. This is incredibly difficult to do. This is not equivalent to just stock picking; one of the most famous hedge fund managers in the world, Warren Buffet, is <em>not</em> just a stock picker. In fact his model for cashflow (using insurance premiums and large lump-sum encouraged industries) is ingenious and just about never talked about because everyone is focused on his returns and not on the method by which he finances those returns. We can talk about Lynch, Taleb, Dalio, Soros and even Simons and come out with a large number of varying genius ways to finance their own outfits but ultimately it is incorrect to assume that it is simply a matter of stock picking.</p>\n\n<p>Finding a method by which one can deviate from the beta of the market and produce excessive returns, esp. in the modern market, is getting harder. One of the principles of old, value investing, and actually it&#39;s counterpart, growth investing, are beginning to wane in ability to be viable particularly because technology is moving faster than ever, the business cycle is becoming significantly shorter, education is widespread so actual entrepreneurship is more widely available which results in worse competition and the fact that information is so available that finding &quot;gems in the rough&quot; is quite difficult. Hedge Funds aim specifically to deviate from beta more or less as protection so you wouldn&#39;t just put all your money into a hedge fund, not that you couldn&#39;t, but in general they are for wealthier individuals to diversify.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion:</p>\n\n<p>This is probably too long and no one will read it. Still, that is what the prevailing arguments are in a nutshell. Yes, this is the short version.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7zm7u/index_fund_people_vs_stock_people/gev4po5/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_gev4po5", "created": 1607312237.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1607283437.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "replies": [{"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_k7zm7u", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gevdlgo", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": {"name": "00cyte", "fullname": "t2_zrhrh"}, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gev4po5", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_zrhrh", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "collapsed": false, "body": "Appreciate the eli5!
