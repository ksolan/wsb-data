{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**I MEANT CALLS FUCK**\n\nMany of you know that the next big move in EV's is who can take the biggest share of the transportation industry. I'm not talking about your mom taking you to the nearest autism center, I'm talking about the transportation of moving your favorite fidget spinner into your Gay Bear hands.\n\n**Why HYLN when Tesla providing trucks soon you fuck???**\n\nVery simple answer, Tesla trucks are nice and all but they have two major limiting factors. \n1.\tThe truck range is only 500 miles (Hyliion's ERX is 1300 miles)\n 2. CHARGING A SEMI IS NOT THE SAME AS CHARGING YOUR MODEL S E X OR Y. \n\nMany reports have come out that state that to charge a tesla truck, it would require revamping entire grids to support those key charging areas. Now imagine when you have to deliver something to bumfuck nowhere, aint gonna be no efficient chargers. The technology just isn't there yet. \n\nhttps://www.greenbiz.com/article/electric-truck-fleets-will-need-lot-power-utilities-arent-planning-it\n\nOk, what does Hyliion do to \"solve\" this problem. Simple. They use natural gas. NATURAL GAS??? WHAT? Yes natural gas. There is already 700+ natural gas stations around the United States, that means that it can easily travel anywhere it needs to, and it is much easier to establish new natural gas stations than it is to revamp electrical grids for tesla chargers, (think of how long its taking to fix flint's water) \n\nAdditionally, it uses an onboard generator under the hood so that when you are driving, IT IS ALSO CHARGING THE BATTERY, this means that the range of a hyliion ERX truck is 1300 miles with an increased payload than Tesla's semi truck. You probably don't know this but many truck companies send out truck drivers in pairs, because of regulations, one drives while the other rests. With tesla trucks you can't do that since it only goes for 500 miles, they would need to stop and charge, while hyliion ERX truck will keep on going.\n\nAlso Hyliion's products are actually net negative carbon emissions. HOW? When cows fart, they give off methane (a pollutant), which is used to create natural gas. As our population grows, more meat eaters, more cows, more methane. Natural gas takes methane out the air and powers shit. Hyliion uses natural gas, that means using hyliion products not only produce clean efficient energy, you are also rapidly removing methane out of the air, a net negative carbon emission.\n\nNow their current amazing product that Hyliion produces is that they  convert the rear axle of EXISITING TRUCKS to electric. Many companies do not want to do the jump in EV because they have already spent millions on their existing trucks. Well that whole market is up for grabs for hyliion because their product will give those existing trucks a 10-30% fuel cost reduction and will give them more torque and power so that when they go up hill, they have a much easier time than now. Additionally they use algorithms to help the driver get the most efficient drive possible and gives them points, think of a mini game for those truckers. \n\n\n**Yo autismo, I just saw their stock and it dipped massively recently, what happened???**\n\nHyliion on November 30th announced that they will redeem their public warrants. Now some people can say that's bad, others say that they are using that extra ~~144 million that they will receive to finish up their infrastructure etc. Either way, do you want to buy on a day its up 50% or do you wanna buy when the stock is red???\n\nNOW IS AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO BUY THE STOCK FOR LOW PRICES.\n\nThe stock had a 20-40% short ratio against it in the past week, and it refused to break the $18 support level. It is itching to go up from here once the news of the warrants are settled. \n\nI am in at 100 shares and buying 600 more in the upcoming days NEXT YEAR DATED CALLS\n\nTLDR: YOUR NEXT STOCK PURCHASE BETTER BE HYLIION DO NOT MESS UP ON THE NEXT TESLA TRAIN. BUYBUYBUY\n\nhttps://www.hyliion.com/\n\n(I LOVE TESLA AS MUCH AS THE NEXT BULL BUT HYLIION TAKES THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY)\n\n*P.S.
