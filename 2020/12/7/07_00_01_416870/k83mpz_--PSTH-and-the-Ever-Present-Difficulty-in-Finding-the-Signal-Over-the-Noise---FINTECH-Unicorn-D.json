Others have posted rebuttals to my original DD in the community. I thank each of you for your thoughtful analysis. I think we've sorted out a lot in the last week. A special thanks to YOLO, who, whether right or wrong, has provided a lot of context on twitter (@YoloCapitalMgmt).\n\nWhile I have remained somewhat quiet on many of the subsequent points of speculation, I wanted to say a few things before the week begins and provide an update.\n\nAlong those lines, this is a response to all of you in the form of an updated DD. Given all that has happened since my OG DD 7 days ago, its warranted and I hope you chose to upvote on the merits of the post quality.\n\nThere is a bit of a focus on the Klarman position in PSTH here for a few reasons: a) there has not been a lot reported on this and b) its incredibly interesting that one hedge fund manager makes such a large deposit in a competitor\u2019s experimental vehicle. A second point of interest here is the role Jackie Reses is playing, one we may be significantly underestimating, despite YOLO's work.\n\n\\--------------------\n\nBackground\n\nIn July of 2020, William \u201cBill\u201d SPACMAN Ackman took the blank cheque company Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd (PSTH) public. The fund raised a record-breaking $4B, becoming the biggest SPAC ever. Investors on the books include big fellas like Seth Klarman and the revered Baupost Group who have invested an astounding $400M position (their biggest to date). Other notables include Guggenheim with a half a billion investment, as well as the Ontario teacher\u2019s union. There is an extremely large outstanding position as well that has yet to be disclosed.\n\nThe stock opened at $20 (NAV). Over the course of the last few weeks it has risen steadily in value and now sits at around $26. Much of this rise, and the new 52 week high (>$27) happened early last week following a lot of online speculation over the weekend regarding Stripe, a private unicorn fintech company run by two Irish brothers, the Collisons.\n\nDD Updates\n\n1. New information has emerged related to Klarman views on Stripe and CB that hadn\u2019t previously been reported by our community. In an investor letter he wrote: \u201c\"Crpto seem more like tulip bulbs for the digital age.\" With respect to Stripe, some have made mention of comments he\u2019s made in the past in terms of being \u201cbullish\u201d on stripe.\n2. Again, with respect to the Klarman and the stripe position there are other important pieces of information to think about. Specifically, what Stripe has said about crpto in the past. Taken from the article above, Stripe wrote in a blog post: \u201c\"Transaction confirmation times have risen substantially; this, in turn, has led to an increase in the failure rate of transactions denominated in fiat currencies,\" Stripe said in a blog post. \"Fees have risen a great deal. For a regular BitC transaction, a fee of tens of U.S. dollars is common, making BitC transactions about as expensive as bank wires.\" Some reasonable contemplation here would lead to some obvious conclusions about the likelihood (lack thereof) of a CB PSTH merger.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Interpretations\n\n\u00b7 Jackie Reses is someone we have underestimated. Those more knowledgeable have posted in the other PSTH threads explaining just how big of a player she is in fintech. Her joining PSTH board is gigantic and confirms that Ackman is targeting a fintech. The baseless rumors around food service industry do not \\*square\\* this circle. She is there for to attract a fintech unicorn and to help it grow. It is incredibly advantageous for Ackman as he will get her on the board, and he has someone he can trust in the Stripe boardroom without going all activist which is what they are worried about.\n\n\u00b7 The more we read about Klarman, the more obvious it is that he is not jumping in on something that is uncertain. There are a few points to make here. In the past he has said the following. Secondly, we know when he got in which was at an avg price of around $22.40. He could have been in at $20. Why wasn\u2019t he? Certainty is why. He bought in around Q3, after the AirBnB talks were confirmed to be dead. No one knows wtf is going on with AirBnB and that was likely why he may have been hesitant (or just not interested at all in it). In the subsequent weeks, Ackman and Stripe had preliminary talks, Ackman made some comments on Stripe not being ready, they made some comments on twitter and in the press and then they went on a hiring spree for public play. What happens just around that time? Klarman\u2019s Baupost buys $400M stake putting 5% of their AUM into PSTH. Ackman is completely able to chat with his investors on how negotiations are going. Something happened in October that we are unaware of.\n\n\u00b7 Stripe and PSTH do not stand to benefit from the hype online if they both know now that this deal is a at 0% of happening. The hype surrounding Stripe is what has led to the new PSTH highs. Literally that is all that\u2019s happened recently that would lead to such dramatic changes in the stock price and after-hours volumes. Going forward, Stripe would benefit from squashing this deal super early in the press to soften that blow and get investors in a comfy spot again in terms of reasonable expectations. They have not done so. Ackman was on twitter this weekend and said nothing. He gave an interview last week talking about how bullish he is on FNMA but said nothing about Stripe when asked about the SPAC. Similarly, Stripe has not outright denied the deal happening. Why is this important? 1) they easily could have 2) their employees are following Ackman, and this would be a huge distraction to their workforce (incentive to crush the rumor). Ultimately, this may not be evidence that talks are ongoing, but it is suspicious. Additionally, they have been floating the valuation during interviews with the press. Just like Ackman saying they are not ready from a public managerial perspective, they could be simply negotiating here, upping the ask price for an in.\n\n\u00b7 Finally, on the point about Stripe\u2019s new valuation. Astute investors and researchers will have stumbled across this Bloomberg article. It clearly argues the risks that come with going this route re: funding. [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-11-25/a-100-billion-valuation-poses-risk-for-silicon-valley-fintech-star-stripe](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-11-25/a-100-billion-valuation-poses-risk-for-silicon-valley-fintech-star-stripe)\n\nA few very interesting points from the article that we should consider carefully:\n\no Shares in Stripe's Dutch rival Adyen have more than doubled in value since the start of the year, outperforming Europe's benchmark index.\n\no That has allowed Adyen to charge less than Stripe, since it\u2019s more affordable to scale your services for large clients than for a panoply of smaller ones.\n\no The new funding round might give the Collisons the choice of pushing any prospective initial public offering further down the line, but a punchy private valuation might also make such a delay necessary. If e-commerce growth slows once life returns to a semblance of normality, then justifying a $100 billion valuation to the public markets could be tougher.\n\n\u00b7 This is relevant for a couple of reasons. It sheds light on the issues with such a huge jump in valuation now and the potential problems they may face in the future in justifying that valuation (even if a potential IPO is 2 years out for them, for example) when e-commerce boom from covid slows down a bit. That is not to say Stripe is a monster that will do well, but it is to say there\u2019s something to be said for not putting the cart before the horse, or the unicorn in this case.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nIn closing, PSTH offers Stripe a unique opportunity to evade a lot of this nonsense and collect public investors who will stick with them over the long term. The investment in a PSTH deal for 15% of the company will serve them well in the future as the company can grow on its own terms and focus on the product and not be distracted by the markets. It also lets them get in within 45 days of signing the LOI, while this boom is still happening.\n\nThat\u2019s all for now folks. I expect to see another massive gap up tomorrow in this stock. The trend started last week, and this play isn\u2019t falling off anyone\u2019s radar. Good luck. Its going to be a wild week.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPositions\n\n4,000 commons at $23.80\n\nA few small June contracts and a very small Dec contract\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u356ag25en361.jpg?width=820&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21dbd5924854a9f7e422d46efdda11f0cc78ebe6", "author_fullname": "t2_5zsga9zf", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "\ud83c\udf19 \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf19 PSTH and the Ever Present Difficulty in Finding the Signal Over the Noise \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udd0a- FINTECH Unicorn DD 2.0 \ud83c\udf19\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf19", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 93, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"u356ag25en361": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 93, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/u356ag25en361.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=451e7306adb472b777915ed0391c890b4601ec11"}, {"y": 187, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/u356ag25en361.jpg?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=7f96f645663b22a026b2fd1377512790266ef7bb"}, {"y": 277, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/u356ag25en361.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=57ff69eaaab82816361120ea5746048c47d6f33e"}, {"y": 554, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/u356ag25en361.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=cef61c65c3e9229f63fcc15537c4453a9852f7ad"}], "s": {"y": 710, "x": 820, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/u356ag25en361.jpg?width=820&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21dbd5924854a9f7e422d46efdda11f0cc78ebe6"}, "id": "u356ag25en361"}}, "name": "t3_k83mpz", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 94, "total_awards_received": 2, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 94, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/KMRFzFJWDhHuSfnEy9wVbcpH6yeYgMiUSqAaevgx90w.jpg", "edited": 1607306774.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1607322646.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>\ud83d\udca3\ud83c\udf19 \ud83d\ude80 PSTH DD 2.0 - Revisited with New Interpretation \ud83d\udca3 \ud83c\udf19\ud83d\ude80</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have written a pinned DD previously on this topic here: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3bf1o/psth_dd_klarman_buffet_ackman_the_unicorn_hunter/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3bf1o/psth_dd_klarman_buffet_ackman_the_unicorn_hunter/</a></p>\n\n<p>Many, many of you have DM\u2019d asking for updates and thoughts.
