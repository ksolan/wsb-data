This bad boy was pulling in money left and right and was trading at a sexy P/E of under 14$. Micron Technologies was trading under 10 bucks before our man main entered the picture, Swag Master Sanjay Mehrotra in 2017 and ever since Micron Technologies has boomed to a beautiful 72$. So what is Micron technologies, and why is it going to make you rich:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is Micron Technology?**\n\nThey're a company that specializes in producing NAND flash Semiconductors. Think the type of semi conductors used in your USBs, memory cards, cell phones and other small devices that lack the sizes for larger forms of dedicated storage. \n\n**What has been happening during the Rona**?:\n\nMicron crashed in February in anticipation of a decline of the global NAND market due to Corona's effects on the supply chain. However this disrupted China's ability to flood the market with semi-conductors and as a result allowed Micron to gobble up a huge amount of the market share. Another [WSBs DD post put it better than I could](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7emhl/micron_technology_mu_dd/). Go read his post as well to get a better idea of what''s been happening over the last few months with Micron:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The memory trough has finally bottomed. Micron did not lose money. How do I know it has bottomed? Earnings from other tech companies. They have been investing in data centers because the new hot technology is AI. Artificial intelligence require massive CPU, memory, and storage. Magnetic disk is so 1980\u2019s, it\u2019s all about NAND today. Who makes the hottest NAND? Intel and Micron collaborated on 3D XPoint (think Intel Optane). It\u2019s 1000x faster than NAND, last 1000X longer, and 10X as dense. It\u2019s basically not volatile DRAM, something to power the AI revolution.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Oh yeah, Micron just bought out Intel\u2019s share of 3DXPoint for 1.5B. The only manufacturing for 3DXPoint is in\u2026 Utah. That\u2019s right, not in China! So now I segue into the Mexican Beer virus. The majority of memory manufacturers are centered in the Wuhan area. The Wuhan area is basically shut down for the foreseeable future. Hmmm\u2026 which memory maker makes memory mostly outside China? If you said Micron, you win the prize. They have manufacturing locations in Idaho (you da hoe), Utah, Virginia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Xian China. They have only one location in China, and it\u2019s not even in Wuhan.\n\nNot only did Micron use Corona as an opportunity to expand its market share, [but the dip in NAND memory demand was temporary and it returned to its upward trend](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/nand-flash-market-is-rebounding-faster-than-the-dram-market). Not only did demand increase; but the supply retracted as manufacturers in China and other Corona hit areas suspended operations as seen by this chart (you might have to click on it to see it closer)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Notice that oversupply is steadily declining](https://preview.redd.it/v8814125il361.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=820a650b6d82e238d8d9ffa53030961d59deeb68)\n\n**Diversification and Innovation**:\n\n[Here's an interview with the Swag Master himself:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLl3b7SMUBk) \n\nThey've been able to make big bucks diversifying into data centers which have boomed with work from home and they've been making money on the online schooling trend. The demand for enterprise PCs has gone up. More or less every product that Micron Technology sells has boomed as a result of corona virus and they were able to achieve an Earnings Per Share growth of +77.55% since last year. They also will likely be used for the AI for self-driving cars so that's going to be exciting. We might even see a huge boom from them in the mid term once they start making deals with large EV manufactures. \n\nNot only have they seen growth in these new product lines but they've also come up with a new chip that should put them ahead of the competition for at [least a few years](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/11/micron-technology-just-announced-an-important-tech/):\n\n>*176-layer NAND flash:*  \n>  \n>In the press release, Micron announced that it had begun volume shipments of the world's first 176-layer NAND flash chips. For those unfamiliar with NAND flash technology, it's becoming the nonvolatile storage medium of choice for many applications.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Nonvolatile storage retains information even when power is turned off. Legacy hard disk technology still has a place in cheap bulk storage in cloud data centers. Yet cost reductions have made NAND closer to hard disk drives in terms of cost-per-bit, and with much better performance and resilience, less space, and better total cost of ownership in many cases. NAND flash is found in data center servers, smartphones, game consoles, and laptops these days.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>With the data revolution taking off, NAND flash demand is supposed to compound at a 30% annual growth rate. Yet many NAND manufacturers have had a hard time making profits in recent years despite that insatiable end demand. Companies have begun stacking NAND modules on top of each other in a 3D vertical structure, with each layer significantly boosting storage capacity. While demand for bits has gone up, the NAND flash producers have oversupplied the market, crashing NAND prices along with profits.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>However, Micron's innovation could give it a significant leg up on rivals next year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why Micron Technology will grow after Covid**:\n\nThe big thing to realize is that Micron technologies has [some of the best chips in the market for handling the type of processing power that cell phones need](https://www.micron.com/insight/5g-ai-and-the-coming-mobile-revolution) for [5G and AI](https://www.micron.com/insight/5g-ai-and-the-coming-mobile-revolution). These guys are going to be miles ahead when 5G becomes the norm and the other companies will be trying to catch up for years. Don't take my word for it, trust everyone's favorite holocaust profiteers and Jeffery epstein's favorite bank, Deusche bank, who recently upgraded their outlook on them:\n\n> In a research report, Ho said that Micron is expected to be a solid recovery pick as the economy starts recovering from the global pandemic. Demand drivers such as data centers, 5G smartphones, and gaming will accelerate the growth of Micron. Ho also pointed out that Micron is well-positioned for CY21 (calendar year 2021).   \n>  \n>Micron Technology is known as being a leading supplier and manufacturer of memory and storage used in a wide range of electronic devices ranging from PCs to smartphones.

Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh recently increased the price target from $56 to $70. And Morningstar equity analyst Abhinav Davuluri, CFA recently increased the target price to $50 per share from $48. And in an analyst rating consensus of Micron stock with 33 ratings, 76% say buy, 21% say hold, and 3% say sell.\n\nThey aren't the only institution that's upgrading their outlook. It'd take too long to go over all of the upgrades so I'm just going to link them:\n\n[Goldman Sachs upgrades Micron Technologies](https://www.thestreet.com/streetlightning/stock-picks/mircon-computer-memory-dram-nand-technology-mu-semiconductor-goldman-sachs-buy)\n\n[Argus Research upgrades Micron Technologies](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml#/news?symbol=MU&pageno=&storyid=202012041056MIDNIGHTUSEQUITY_A2316094&provider=MIDNIGHT&product=USEQUITY&sb=1&sc=1&san=1)\n\n[Morgan Stanley upgrades Micron Technologies](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3205255&headline=MU-Micron-price-target-raised-to--from--at-Morgan-Stanley)\n\n[UBS Upgrades Micron Technologies](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/micron-shares-jump-after-ubs-boosts-rating-price-target)\n\n[Wells Fargo upgrades Micron Technologies](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3204494&headline=MU-Micron-price-target-raised-to--from--at-Wells-Fargo)\n\nTheres probably more that I'm missing but you dont need me to post every [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com)/Seeking Alpha/Motley Small Bus Rider word vomit from 2 bit prop traders and amatuer hedge fund larpers to prove my point. This bad boi is going up bigly.\n\n**The most important bit: How to trade**:\n\nYou guys can try making money with out of the money two week calls but I suspect that there are other ways to make money on this that might be more lucrative.\n\nFirst of all shares. Yes they are boring but keep in mind there's a really, really good chance that Micron gets the Vale treatment in the near future and spikes on rumors of being able to supply one of the big EVs with chips. I'm not going to tell you when this might happen because no one knows. But I feel it in my heart of hearts and half of the analysts upgrading it mention how Micron's new chip is going to have massive applications with self-driving automobile technology and if you watched some of the interviews with the Swag Master he always brings it up. Sure it might not be TSLA since they are in bed with TSM but keep in mind if they choose to keep that deal proprietary and TSM doesn't sell that chip to anyone else that means that basically there are no other chips for EV companies to choose from other than Micron.\n\nSecond what I'd really recommend are Leaps. Buy yourself some 2022 out of the money calls and you will print money in due time. There are just so many upside potentials with Micron that if even one of them ends up working out then these leaps will print.\n\nTLDR: Buy the 85$ January 2022 MU calls.
