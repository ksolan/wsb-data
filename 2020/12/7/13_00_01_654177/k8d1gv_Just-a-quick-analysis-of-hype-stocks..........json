This post doesn't violate any of these as I carefully read them and checked them out so my post would not violate them. This is not an opinion, but advice that I would like to share with this community and I give this advice responsibly*\n\n1. Some of you may know the initial life cycle of a stock after its IPO\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k4ezmfwt9q361.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e2bccafaf7b8be65602664bcfda034b5d121f55\n\nI sat down this morning with a cup of coffee and briefly looked at NIO and Palantir stocks\n\nAnd It is not always the case but something much more thought requiring and complicated\n\n2) Basically, NIO and Palantir look like 2 distant realities\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4vswn8b9q361.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d125665ae074fa251ecacf5bc455e188b39ed3e9\n\nIt did not go immediately into the main hype and It took 2 years to do so. Of course, before the end of May 2020 NIO was just a Chinese tech company with little awareness in America, being IPOed in the US, It explains such a time\n\nBut the more (time), the merrier (volatility), and the little awareness about NIO and how things are going in the company created a highly inefficient market. The stock rose from its low of about 1.20$ to 57.20$ (47.66 times of 4666%). It is a tech company, and Who doesn't love the juicy tech?\n\nAlso, there've been 2 small hypes before the main hype (as opposed to the graph above with its 1 small hype rise and the main hype rise)\n\n(The diagonal blue line is the mean that is drawn based on the lows and highs on the graph above, the curve is the 200 EMA)\n\n3) But Palantir is another story\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8xgi2wdc9q361.jpg?width=1128&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b17da2d42cb1e154779d83a5505283419a6c5cc\n\nIt started trading on 30 Sep. 2020, and It took just 1 month to start the main hype. There was no initial hype (well the kind of a rise that you can consider to be substantial, Before 30 October It just got up and down by approx. a 1 $, relative to the price before the rise of approx. 10 $)\n\nThere is a nice dip on 30 Oct and after that, there's a shallow but continuous rise before there's the dramatic rise in the price (the tendency that you can also see in NIO)\n\nThese two stocks crashed (Well, They actually just went down not substantially) right after they IPOed.\n\nThe market basically wanted to get to the dip and to trigger some selling activity just so the smartest traders can get more shares for cheap\n\nThere are 3 great dips on the trend of the main hype, in an upward channel manner in both NIO and Palantir. NIO has longer and shallower dips indicating the uncertainty and the lack of Information behind the stock. Palantir had dips ranging from a couple of hours to 2 days\n\nThe two dips before the main hype are below the mean (Which can be drawn initially before the main hype, using the low at the very beginning, further lows and highs and their support resistance channel levels, and the general upside direction, Just like in the pictures above).\n\nThis quick analysis takes the time period between when Stock IPOed and the top of the main hype.  The analysis doesn't look at what happens next after the stock reaches its hype top.\n\nThe coffee was good and the morning was nice and I hope that you can build a good strategy on the initial life cycle and behavior patterns of hype stocks.......\n\n*Ps.
