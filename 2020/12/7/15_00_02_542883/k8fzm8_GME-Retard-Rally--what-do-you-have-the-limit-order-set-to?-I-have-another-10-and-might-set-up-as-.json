Each contract = 100 shares, so you could sell 2 contracts.\n\nGo look in the \"trade options\" section of GME, at the top select \"sell\" and \"call\" and swipe left and right for different dates, and up and down for different premiums. It'll say something like GME $20c 12/18/2020 $0.32 which means you get paid 0.32 x 100 shares = $32 for one contract right now, and if the share price goes above $20 by 12/18/2020 then whoever bought your contract can then buy your shares. You get paid the premium, and your profit is the strike price minus whatever you paid for your shares. If it doesn't reach $20 then they won't buy your shares and you keep the premium and shares to do with as you please. You want to sell one with a high premium so you make decent profit, at a close date and a high strike price so that it expires quickly WITHOUT reaching the strike price, and you get paid premium and keep the shares when it expires. To make the most premium you kinda want to let the stock pump and get people excited, and sell for a strike just out of range, so when it corrects it falls safely back down to about what you paid for the shares.

Let's say you write and sell a single 12/18/2020 20c for $0.32 you make $32 now, but then GME tanks, well since the contract is partially based off the current share price, the contract goes way down in price too. If it goes far enough it'll sit at $0.01 At that point (or any point in between) you can close that contract by BUYING an identical contract, but now the price is $0.01 so you pay $1 and that closes the contract, you have no more obligation, and you keep your shares.
