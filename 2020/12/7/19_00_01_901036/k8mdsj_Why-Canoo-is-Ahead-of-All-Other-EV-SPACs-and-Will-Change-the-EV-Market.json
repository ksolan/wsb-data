{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**A Quick Intro:**\n\nCanoo is an EV company going public through an SPAC merger later this month. Their 1st vehicle will begin mass production in 2022. You can look at it [HERE](https://www.canoo.com/design/)\n\nIt plans to offer it's product (vehicles) through a subscription based model. These subscriptions could be 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, 1+ year, etc. The subscription includes the vehicle, registration, maintenance, charging, and access to insurance.\n\n**What Puts Them Ahead?**\n\nThere's a few things that do. The easiest to see is the fact that they have a product. Their first van type vehicle(aka the BangBus) has already went through 50 crash tests and has actually been driving on the  highway.\n\nThe most exciting fact is the **Skateboard Design.** First watch [THIS](https://youtu.be/8m3fRujSlW0). The skateboard is essentially everything that makes the car go. Combine this with their steer by wire design(frees up a ton of space and can be put anywhere) and you have everything you need to make the car drive in the floor of the vehicle. This means for every model they're just adding the top \"shell\" to the skateboard and BOOM: you have a vehicle. Once they finalize the skateboard design(which they pretty much have done) then they can pump out new EV models like nothing. I'm talking delivery van, pickup truck, sports car, sedan, etc. [This picture sums it up](https://i0.wp.com/alabamanewscenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Canoo_Design_Exterior_Possibilities.jpg?ssl=1) All they have to do is the design work, slap it on the skateboard, and run some tests.\n\nTheir **Subscription Based Model** makes electric cars available to a a whole new market. This includes people who don't want to fully buy/own a car. The monthly fee covers literally everything so it's perfect for them. It includes people who can't afford to buy an electric car. The subscription model lowers the price of owning an EV, making it accessible to more customers. And then since it's easier for them to make new models, they may be the first to put an electric delivery van or pickup truck on the market. This would attract a TON of retail businesses/people.\n\nNow the rest is **Purely Speculative** but there are plenty of potential deals that may arise that make a lot of sense. The most being an **Uber** or Lyft deal. The subscription model makes Canoo vehicles perfect for Uber drivers. No gas expense, no maintenance fee, won't have to dirty your own car, etc. And Uber could then play this up in advertising by saying many of their drivers \"drive electric\".\n\nThis is another popular one but a shot in the dark. **Apple** has been wanting to get into the EV game for awhile. Canoo would be the perfect target for an investment. An innovative product that rethinks how vehicles are traditionally made and sold. It's not like Apple has ever made anything like that before...........\n\n**The Stock Itself:**\n\nCanoo has largely been under the radar until the past week or so. They have a lot of good things happening this month, which could serve as major catalysts. They're unveiling their delivery van on December 17th, voting on the merger on the 21st, and who knows what else might happen. Canoo is being valuated at $2.4 billion through this merger, which is criminally low. The only way I see this company going is up from here on out.\n\n[Watch this is you want to feel as confident as I am in this company](https://youtu.be/9F_W8pev4XQ)\n\nTLDR; Shares, Warrants, Calls. They all go.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add that they have an engineering contract with Hyundai and Kia to help them develop a skateboard for their Electric line of cars.
