{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**TLDR; Coca Cola is still 10% below its pre-covid high.  It should go even higher.**\n\nFor the 8 of you still reading, I present to you a somewhat neglected stock hurt by Covid that hasn't fully recovered, but also one whose February high of $60 is not a ceiling.\n\nYes, Coca Cola has had a decent run from it's $36 March lows and is even up 12% since October, trading about $54/share as of Friday before pulling back a bit this morning.  It's not done yet.  Let me provide a few reasons why.\n\nTo understand where we're going, let's look at where we've been. Here's a 5 year chart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[5 year performance of KO: courtesy of CNBC](https://preview.redd.it/4lmb773xnl361.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e426700a92d40cd64e6d58994cb5f330a9b8658)\n\nThe stock has been of a bit of a snoozer until it began to awake from its slumber about 2018, which accelerated through 2019 and then Wall Street really started to like it in 2020.  It had upward momentum, upset by Covid.  This momentum will return, very soon.\n\n**Catalyst:  In Person Dining**\n\nWhy will momentum return?  Most importantly, vaccines will return restaurants back to normal operations by summer 2021. The restaurant industry has been in total carnage.  Independent restaurants are closing permanently every day, with large chains taking market share.  BUT - those that are still operating are living off of Off-Premise consumption.  IF people get drinks to go, they get one.  No refills.  This has depressed an entire major sector of Coke's sales.  As restaurants return to normal, they'll have more customers, and existing customers will be consuming more cokes per sale than they are now.  That's a double re-open win.\n\n**Catalyst: Cutting overhead like a mo-fo**\n\nThere's more to this story.  Coke has used Covid as an opportunity to cut costs and streamline operations.  They've cut employees and overhead expense - [more than 1/3 of their North American employees](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/08/28/coca-cola-says-layoffs-buyouts-likely-part-restructuring/5654218002/).  They've cut a lot of niche product that had overhead burden and marketing/distribution expense but had little revenue, much less profit, [like Tab.](https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2020/10/19/Coca-Cola-discontinues-TaB-diet-soda-in-the-US)\n\nThey're going to come out of this a leaner, more focused company.  They may still have an old and sleepy brand image, but they're also a cash printing machine, and they're going to be printing even more tendies to share with us.\n\n**Catalyst: Falling Dollar**\n\nBut wait! There's more!\n\nCoca Cola generates [roughly one third of its revenue from North America](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271136/coca-colas-revenue-distribution-worldwide-by-operating-segment/).  That leaves the balance subject to currency fluctuations.  With the dollar tanking, [those foreign profits are going to be worth even more.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/how-us-benefits-when-dollar-falls.asp)\n\n**Not Priced In**\n\nLooking at the [CNBC.com](https://CNBC.com) earnings helps demonstrate that the street has not priced in the recovery, much less the benefits from restructuring and currency.  The company itself has not been providing guidance as they have no more visibility than we do how the almost random shutdown/reopen orders will happen.  They did, however, [warn that Q3 would be hampered by currency exchange rates when the dollar was strengthening](https://www.barrons.com/articles/coca-cola-stock-is-rising-after-earnings-heres-why-51595335348), the opposite of what is happening now and projected to continue for a bit.  How did Q3 end up when the currency was facing headwinds?  They beat the street consensus by 18.8%, and were just one cent per share less than a year ago - when unemployment was at a record low and everything was \"normal\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Coke's Earnings Trend - CNBC](https://preview.redd.it/34xwla91jm361.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=15d64af9e6559ac5d1bb1e8bf1cc76f77e8f219b)\n\nBased on the same CNBC data, the street is projecting that one year from now, after restaurants are fully operational, after the company has completed a worldwide restructuring that will eliminate 1/3 of its North American employees, and after the benefit of a presumed lower dollar, the company will just be earning 3 cents more in Q3 and Q4 2021 than it did in 2019, pre-covid.  Again, this would say that reopening their fountain sales division to normal levels is only worth 4 cents per share from this past quarter when much of the country remains shut down.  That seems low.  Too low.\n\n**Benchmark: Starbucks**\n\nWhat's the upside here?  I'm using Starbucks as the benchmark.  They're both beverage companies, though Starbucks is clearly more of a direct restaurant play, and more of a pure play on China's reopening - which is far ahead of the US's and the rest of the world's economy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Starbucks One Year Performance - CNBC](https://preview.redd.it/ifebi0x2tl361.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=606fe19138dfcfc86ff139b105225bc1b2dab23b)\n\nStarbucks hit a high of about 93 in January, as Covid was already gripping China.  It then fell and rebounded to about $90 in February before beginning the March market swoon.  On the way back up it kept bouncing into that $90 level (frustrating the hell out of me holding $90 calls) before finally breaking through on the way to all time highs, now at $102, almost 10% above the January highs.\n\nLooking at a similar pattern (though KO held on longer before a much quicker descent) I would expect KO to test $60 soon, and probably bounce off a time or two before breaking through.  Again, based on prior momentum I would expect once it clears $60 it should easily run up another 10%.  The market will quickly recognize when they reopen they're going to have more operating leverage than when the shutdown began, and they're going to start seeing currency gains as soon as this quarter.\n\n**Benchmark: Pepsi**\n\nPepsi is probably viewed as Coke's more direct competitor.  Coke had been outperforming them over the last 3 years until the Covid dip.  Pepsi, more diversified because of its snack businesses, was the better stay at home play.  Coke has a decent catch up trade remaining.\n\n[3 year performance Coke vs Pepsi: Barchart.com](https://preview.redd.it/x6eb2dahfm361.png?width=2326&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d74d592426a18cfc7be54f10f760bc19dd8fd53)\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nSugar water doesn't get stock analysts excited any more than WSB casino patrons.  For that reason, I would not be looking at any FD's.  This one needs some longer dated options.\n\nI want to get past the next earnings on 1/28 for evidence of the currency lift to begin to show, but the country will likely still be in winter Covid shutdown mode so I'm not sure we'll get guidance then based on restaurant openings.  I'm also feeling like mid-January/February could be a bit rough after a lights-out November and a presumed Santa Claus rally at month's end.  Keep some powder dry to buy this on dips. I am.\n\nI'm thinking there's a three-prong approach here.\n\nFor the first taste, February 55 calls.  Relatively low risk (only slightly OTM), gets us a few weeks past the next earnings date when we should at least see a currency boost, but also captures any run up as the market starts to figure out there's still reopening meat left here to take off the bone.\n\nI'm going to put the heart of the play into June 60 calls.  The country should be mostly vaccinated, restaurants should be back to near normal.  Hopefully this will be telegraphed by the April earnings call.  If this gets priced in sooner...[Vega is your friend.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7eto7/you_trolls_are_in_desperate_need_of_understanding/)\n\nFor a stretch, going to throw the balance of the play into leaps for Jan 2022 65's.\n\nI'm starting this position with $5K.  Because I expect a decent dip sometime Jan/Feb, will hopefully have some dry powder on the sideline to increase these positions if I've been too early on this move.  But as we've seen with many of the reopening plays, when the market decides it's time, I don't want to be late....or any later than I already am.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nPurchased this morning at

They beat the street consensus by 18.8%, and were just one cent per share less than a year ago - when unemployment was at a record low and everything was &quot;normal&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/34xwla91jm361.png?width=1326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15d64af9e6559ac5d1bb1e8bf1cc76f77e8f219b\">Coke&#39;s Earnings Trend - CNBC</a></p>\n\n<p>Based on the same CNBC data, the street is projecting that one year from now, after restaurants are fully operational, after the company has completed a worldwide restructuring that will eliminate 1/3 of its North American employees, and after the benefit of a presumed lower dollar, the company will just be earning 3 cents more in Q3 and Q4 2021 than it did in 2019, pre-covid.  Again, this would say that reopening their fountain sales division to normal levels is only worth 4 cents per share from this past quarter when much of the country remains shut down.  That seems low.  Too low.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Benchmark: Starbucks</strong></p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s the upside here?  I&#39;m using Starbucks as the benchmark.  They&#39;re both beverage companies, though Starbucks is clearly more of a direct restaurant play, and more of a pure play on China&#39;s reopening - which is far ahead of the US&#39;s and the rest of the world&#39;s economy.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ifebi0x2tl361.png?width=1562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=606fe19138dfcfc86ff139b105225bc1b2dab23b\">Starbucks One Year Performance - CNBC</a></p>\n\n<p>Starbucks hit a high of about 93 in January, as Covid was already gripping China.  It then fell and rebounded to about $90 in February before beginning the March market swoon.  On the way back up it kept bouncing into that $90 level (frustrating the hell out of me holding $90 calls) before finally breaking through on the way to all time highs, now at $102, almost 10% above the January highs.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at a similar pattern (though KO held on longer before a much quicker descent) I would expect KO to test $60 soon, and probably bounce off a time or two before breaking through.  Again, based on prior momentum I would expect once it clears $60 it should easily run up another 10%.  The market will quickly recognize when they reopen they&#39;re going to have more operating leverage than when the shutdown began, and they&#39;re going to start seeing currency gains as soon as this quarter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Benchmark: Pepsi</strong></p>\n\n<p>Pepsi is probably viewed as Coke&#39;s more direct competitor.  Coke had been outperforming them over the last 3 years until the Covid dip.  Pepsi, more diversified because of its snack businesses, was the better stay at home play.  Coke has a decent catch up trade remaining.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/x6eb2dahfm361.png?width=2326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d74d592426a18cfc7be54f10f760bc19dd8fd53\">3 year performance Coke vs Pepsi: Barchart.com</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Strategy:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sugar water doesn&#39;t get stock analysts excited any more than WSB casino patrons.  For that reason, I would not be looking at any FD&#39;s.  This one needs some longer dated options.</p>\n\n<p>I want to get past the next earnings on 1/28 for evidence of the currency lift to begin to show, but the country will likely still be in winter Covid shutdown mode so I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ll get guidance then based on restaurant openings.  I&#39;m also feeling like mid-January/February could be a bit rough after a lights-out November and a presumed Santa Claus rally at month&#39;s end.  Keep some powder dry to buy this on dips. I am.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m thinking there&#39;s a three-prong approach here.</p>\n\n<p>For the first taste, February 55 calls.  Relatively low risk (only slightly OTM), gets us a few weeks past the next earnings date when we should at least see a currency boost, but also captures any run up as the market starts to figure out there&#39;s still reopening meat left here to take off the bone.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m going to put the heart of the play into June 60 calls.  The country should be mostly vaccinated, restaurants should be back to near normal.  Hopefully this will be telegraphed by the April earnings call.  If this gets priced in sooner...<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7eto7/you_trolls_are_in_desperate_need_of_understanding/\">Vega is your friend.</a></p>\n\n<p>For a stretch, going to throw the balance of the play into leaps for Jan 2022 65&#39;s.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m starting this position with $5K.  Because I expect a decent dip sometime Jan/Feb, will hopefully have some dry powder on the sideline to increase these positions if I&#39;ve been too early on this move.  But as we&#39;ve seen with many of the reopening plays, when the market decides it&#39;s time, I don&#39;t want to be late....or any later than I already am.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Positions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Purchased this morning at open:</p>\n\n<p><a
