This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits I track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/11.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 11/29 \u2013 12/5.  For Friday\u2019s expiration there are 186 contracts and 330 mentions of these contracts.  The most popular contract is the 12/11 TSLA 600 Call with 14 mentions.  \n\n\nThe goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF\u2019s such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index\u2019s year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.  \n\n\nCall Data\n\n\n* Out of the 186 contracts 150 are calls (+80%+ Long)  \n\n* 75.3% of the calls are out of the money\n\n* The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money. \n\n* The in the money calls are an average of 19.3% in the money. \n\n\nPut Data\n\n\n* Out of 186 Contracts 36 are puts\n\n* 86.1% of the puts are out of the money\n\n* The out of the money puts are an average of 20% out of the money\n\n* The in the money puts are an average of 8% in the money \n\n\nOn both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 186 contracts only 42 are in the money as of last Friday\u2019s close. \n\nThe most popular calls that are in the money are the \n\n* TSLA 570 \u2013 590 \n* ACB 10.  \n\nThe most popular puts that are in the money are all NKLA.  \n\nThe most popular calls that are out of the money are the \n\n* TSLA 600 - 650, \n* GME 20, \n* PLTR 25 - 40, \n* AMD 100, \n* SPY 370 - 380,\n* APHA 9.  \n\nThe most popular puts that are out of the money are \n\n* NKLA 15, \n* PLTR 15 \u2013 21, \n* NIO 40 \n* ACB 7.  \n\nAs I said above my hypothesis going into this week is that the majority of these contracts will end up being losers.  Based on this data I would probably look to sell the 370 Spy Calls and TSLA 600 calls if my hypothesis turns out to be right.
