{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "  \n\nPLTR DD\n\nStarting point**:** \n\n**RECENT EVENT REACTION**: Palantir's traction with large government contracts, such as its recent $44 million order with U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Covid-19 treatment approvals, could be a sign the company is finding success with expanding uses of its products beyond defense, terrorism threats, cybersecurity and fraud detection. Still, customer concentration and lack of a cloud-based subscription model could limit Palantir's revenue-growth visibility beyond 2021. (12/08/20)\n\n1. Palantir: Company Outlook THESIS: Palantir's software use for contact tracing and supply-chain analysis during the pandemic could be a tailwind for top-line growth and new-customer additions in the near-term. While the company's addressable-market view remains clouded by its lack of a partner ecosystem and reliance on large government customers for sales, we believe Palantir's proprietary datasets and shortening deployment times could help broaden its potential uses and diversify the customer base. Investments in building direct services \n\n**Valuation Unlikely** to Match Cloud IPOs Palantir is unlikely to garner a valuation similar to pure-play cloud-software IPOs, which averaged a 65% gain in their public-market debuts. While the company has strong intellectual property, built around the use of big data for its analytics offering, we believe its top-line growth in the $26.5 billion analytics tools software market could be limited by growing competition from stand-alone providers such as Tableau (bought by Salesforce.com) and Qlik, as well as hyperscale-cloud peers including Microsoft's Power BI and Amazon AWS. Palantir's lack of a partner ecosystem limits its operating-margin expansion, in our view. The company's multi-class voting structure, with a majority of voting rights for its co-founders, and a lack of customer diversification could hurt institutional interest. (09/29/20)\n\nHowever in my report of PLTR I strongly believe that it has the momentum for the next quarter to strongly outperform the news and it could be traded at an overvalued price for much longer, and because of this short term profits could be made on this investment. \n\nFundamental \n\n[Figure 1 ](https://preview.redd.it/g6m3pl14yu361.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=318c5c280ec41cd92ab20d6abe9e360779e92eb6)\n\nWe can see that in the sector that they are in they are performing better than the competition in terms of sales Their EBIT is quite high and their p/e rate is lower than the competition. If we look at the recent sales and buys done we can see that the rate of institution ownership went up quite a bit. This is in fact good news for us. And we can see growth from here.\n\n[Figure 2 ](https://preview.redd.it/xhxbebu9yu361.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ebe37d79b17578b839301d986f93ba44bf2b463)\n\n&#x200B;\n\na) The operating income is almost double in loss but this should not discourage the prediction because it\u2019s a new IPO and they are using their money to grow their operations so this would be expected. The total debt increased however this is also due to the rapid growth of the company and them expanding \n\n**What does the company do?** \n\nData analytics is their prime focus since IPO earlier this year they have +160% after announcing their FDA response and the company working with news on working with Greece with their covid-19 response they have gained 20% today The stock is up big on Monday after the company reportedly won a new FDA contract to use Palantir software to help the agency conduct drug reviews. The software will help the FDA with drug approvals, including potential COVID-19 treatments.\n\nPalantir CEO Alex Karp also joined Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on a teleconference to discuss Palantir's partnership with Greece to support COVID-19 response efforts. Since the start of the pandemic, Palantir has worked with the Greek government to help guide decisions on how to best deal with the crisis.\n\n[figure 3 ](https://preview.redd.it/2vdjxgnfyu361.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e8790bf83fbfcbcdd5d52e0c5f550a84d2b07c8)\n\n**The ownership** \n\nof institutions is up by 2% and the # of buys is up by 100% indicating to us that the market is deciding to go long on this stock. These are all bullish indicators and tell us a story; a story of going to the moon. \n\nb) Other investments made to the company are all up and long on the stock. \n\nc) This shows us the ownership of the company. \n\n[Figure 4 ](https://preview.redd.it/cazcwwclyu361.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=803bbd3c253b0bfe0b5604523637c3743b5f456a)\n\n**Insider Purchase sales** \n\nWe can see at the rally 2 weeks ago that insider selling was high this could indicate to us that there where massive sell off however as I previously mentioned there is momentum to the stock and that the news of many insider selloffs didn\u2019t effect the rally tells us that this stock has the potential to go even higher. I would suggest that these sell offs where purely psychological and they where done by people that invested their money since the company IPO mostly from within the company so this does not indicate to us that the price would go down. \n\n[Figure 5 ](https://preview.redd.it/43m30xvnyu361.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f4f00fabf1feb1fae7ae70ba746ebc417bc95316)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sells of PLTR** \n\nThe majority of the institution holders were selling at the rally last week. However, they didn\u2019t sell completely and decreased their position size. This is just because its part of their trading strategy and when there is a rally that big in order to hedge the massive investments they have to do a partial sell ofs of their position. They would eventually buy back in at the next rally because there is just enough momentum to keep the stock going higher( they are just buying the dips) \n\n[figure 5 ](https://i.redd.it/3y755zdryu361.gif)\n\n \n\n**Earings report** predictions say that the earings are matched with the stock growth and this should b an indicator that the company is performing in touch with reality and that it is not that overvalued at this point of time and that the extrinsic value that is brought to us by the recent news would rally this stock higher. \n\nOperating profit to stock price. \n\n[figure 6](https://i.redd.it/q79cta8uyu361.gif)\n\n[figure 7 ](https://i.redd.it/9oovwplvyu361.gif)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Supply Chain** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvrg8mmxyu361.jpg?width=1919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=150a5a22517d1c0e760b87a731d0cb818b92bdb3\n\nIn the supply chain of PLTR \n\nWe can see that their top 10 competitors are doing similar in their sector and that their majority customer is the US government which makes them a reliable source because they have unlimited money :P so they would pay regardless. This supply chain is fairly simple however it creates a better foundation for the companies foundation. \n\nIn short, I think that the PLTR has more room for growth and we can expect $40-45 by end of Q1 and I am in a long bullish position for this company, \n\nPosition C$45/03/21", "author_fullname": "t2_4wcdfk01", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title":

(09/29/20)</p>\n\n<p>However in my report of PLTR I strongly believe that it has the momentum for the next quarter to strongly outperform the news and it could be traded at an overvalued price for much longer, and because of this short term profits could be made on this investment. </p>\n\n<p>Fundamental </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/g6m3pl14yu361.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=318c5c280ec41cd92ab20d6abe9e360779e92eb6\">Figure 1 </a></p>\n\n<p>We can see that in the sector that they are in they are performing better than the competition in terms of sales Their EBIT is quite high and their p/e rate is lower than the competition. If we look at the recent sales and buys done we can see that the rate of institution ownership went up quite a bit. This is in fact good news for us. And we can see growth from here.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xhxbebu9yu361.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ebe37d79b17578b839301d986f93ba44bf2b463\">Figure 2 </a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>a) The operating income is almost double in loss but this should not discourage the prediction because it\u2019s a new IPO and they are using their money to grow their operations so this would be expected. The total debt increased however this is also due to the rapid growth of the company and them expanding </p>\n\n<p><strong>What does the company do?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Data analytics is their prime focus since IPO earlier this year they have +160% after announcing their FDA response and the company working with news on working with Greece with their covid-19 response they have gained 20% today The stock is up big on Monday after the company reportedly won a new FDA contract to use Palantir software to help the agency conduct drug reviews. The software will help the FDA with drug approvals, including potential COVID-19 treatments.</p>\n\n<p>Palantir CEO Alex Karp also joined Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on a teleconference to discuss Palantir&#39;s partnership with Greece to support COVID-19 response efforts. Since the start of the pandemic, Palantir has worked with the Greek government to help guide decisions on how to best deal with the crisis.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2vdjxgnfyu361.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e8790bf83fbfcbcdd5d52e0c5f550a84d2b07c8\">figure 3 </a></p>\n\n<p><strong>The ownership</strong> </p>\n\n<p>of institutions is up by 2% and the # of buys is up by 100% indicating to us that the market is deciding to go long on this stock. These are all bullish indicators and tell us a story; a story of going to the moon. </p>\n\n<p>b) Other investments made to the company are all up and long on the stock. </p>\n\n<p>c) This shows us the ownership of the company. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cazcwwclyu361.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=803bbd3c253b0bfe0b5604523637c3743b5f456a\">Figure 4 </a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Insider Purchase sales</strong> </p>\n\n<p>We can see at the rally 2 weeks ago that insider selling was high this could indicate to us that there where massive sell off however as I previously mentioned there is momentum to the stock and that the news of many insider selloffs didn\u2019t effect the rally tells us that this stock has the potential to go even higher. I would suggest that these sell offs where purely psychological and they where done by people that invested their money since the company IPO mostly from within the company so this does not indicate to us that the price would go down. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/43m30xvnyu361.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4f00fabf1feb1fae7ae70ba746ebc417bc95316\">Figure 5 </a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sells of PLTR</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The majority of the institution holders were selling at the rally last week. However, they didn\u2019t sell completely and decreased their position size. This is just because its part of their trading strategy and when there is a rally that big in order to hedge the massive investments they have to do a partial sell ofs of their position. They would eventually buy back in at the next rally because there is just enough momentum to keep the stock going higher( they are just buying the dips) </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/3y755zdryu361.gif\">figure 5 </a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Earings report</strong> predictions say that the earings are matched with the stock growth and this should b an indicator that the company is performing in touch with reality and that it is not that overvalued at this point of time and that the extrinsic value that is brought to us by the recent news would rally this stock higher. </p>\n\n<p>Operating profit to stock price. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/q79cta8uyu361.gif\">figure 6</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/9oovwplvyu361.gif\">figure 7 </a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Supply Chain</strong> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hvrg8mmxyu361.jpg?width=1919&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=150a5a22517d1c0e760b87a731d0cb818b92bdb3\">https://preview.redd.it/hvrg8mmxyu361.jpg?width=1919&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=150a5a22517d1c0e760b87a731d0cb818b92bdb3</a></p>\n\n<p>In the supply chain of PLTR </p>\n\n<p>We can see that their top 10 competitors are doing similar in their sector and that their majority customer is the US government which makes them a reliable source because they have unlimited money :P so they would pay regardless. This supply chain is fairly simple however it creates a better foundation for the companies foundation. </p>\n\n<p>In short, I think that the PLTR has more room for growth and we can expect $40-45 by end of Q1 and I am in a long bullish position for this company, </p>\n\n<p>Position C$45/03/21</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null,
