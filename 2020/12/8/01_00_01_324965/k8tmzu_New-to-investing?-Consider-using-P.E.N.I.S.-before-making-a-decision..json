Take a look at the price history of a stock, and see how its changed. A stock that has a fast price change may be more risky, but may also get you rewards faster. A stock that has slow price changes may not make you as much money as fast, but may also have less potential for you to lose money. Take a look at where the price is now to where it was 1, 3, 6, and 12 months ago. Look for a trend in the price history and find any news from around those times that might explain why it changed, and what it might mean for the future. \n\n\n**E**\nEmployees-ALWAYS find the number of employees in a company.

Look at their debt, income, profits, spending,etc. Companies that have high debt or low to negative profits may still have money to be made from, but it might not be anytime soon. Debt, income, profits, and company spending can heavily impact the price of a stock. Make sure to check when their earnings releases are as well. Even speculation about earnings, in the days and even week(s) leading up to a report can pump up or deflate the price of a stock. Rapid changes in value before an earnings report may be a sign that a sudden spike or dip in price is coming soon, so look out. \n\n\n**I**\nInvestments-Check what other people, corporations, and investment firms are saying and doing about it. If a large corporation is investing large amounts of money into the stock you\u2019re looking into, they see the company is profitable. People may post online about what they\u2019re investing in. Be wary of this advice. Make sure to do your own research, regardless of their reasons. They may be trying to organize a pump and dump scheme, but not always. If a big company or investment firm is selling large amounts of stock, they may see a better investment coming or expecting a big dip in share price soon. Be wary of these companies too. Citron is a perfect example that some people at the top are just as stupid as the average person. \n\n\n**S**\nSpace-See if the industry and company has space to grow. A company may have no debt, positive income, and a strong backround, but if it can\u2019t improve much more, the company will probably see a decline or slow growth of value in the future. For example, the auto industry, which has been slowly dying (according to my dad, who has worked in it for ~30 year), has gotten a boost recently because of EV. Using green energy and trying to make it more efficient has \nopened up some space for the industry to grow. \n\nBonus for S-Sober. DO NOT make any calls while on any kind of depressant. If you don\u2019t wanna be sober while trading, stick to stimulants.
