{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I worked for Doordash for nearly two years. I didn't get fired, and this post will be solid DD about how their business operations are dogshit, not me whining because I was underpaid or let go(tho I was underpaid).\n\n**1) The fucking network goes down constantly, their tech is trash**\n\nGo read /r/doordash_drivers or any other employee sub. AT LEAST once per month, on a Friday or Saturday night, the ENTIRE network goes down for at least 1 hour. What happens when the entire network goes down? All restaurants still have to be paid for the food they made, and all orders have to be refunded to customers, who also demand refunds because their tendies were late. Yes, sometimes companies shit is fucked, Facebook has an outage sometimes too. But it happens to Doordash constantly, BEFORE COVID doubled their order volume.\n\nRegarding their tech - here's how the process is supposed to work.\n\n1)You punch in an order for tendies.\n\n2) The restaurant gets a little ping on their tablet saying \"Order? Ya takin this brah?\" (or, LMFAO, the Doordash CALL CENTER CALLS THE ORDER INTO THE RESTAURANT, YES, THEY REALLY DO THIS)\n\n3) The restaurant clicks accept and starts making the food.\n\n4) The Doordash Network does the travelling salesman optimization poorly and offers the order to drivers.\n\n5) A driver accepts\n\n6) The restaurant hits a \"confirmed rdy\" button and the driver, notified via text message comes in an picks it up.\n\nAt EVERY single point in this process, with regularity, I would see evidence that the Doordash system sent the process forward without confirmations. If a restaurant didn't turn their tablet on that morning? Doesn't matter, I'm at the restaurant now asking about an order that they never knew they had, but SOMEHOW confirmed it was ready - despite having a tablet with a dead battery. I'd have my phone in one hand with the \"Order Ready For Pickup at Tendie Shop\" text message in one hand, and be holding the restaurant's dead tablet in my other hand.\n\nCustomers would call me, two seconds after I left the store having hit \"Picked Up\", asking me where I was, because the app told them I was outside.\n\nWhat happens when their network delivers confirmation notifications that are lies? Lost money.\n\nUber has algorithms that automatically price rides and orders. The price changes with demand. What does Doordash do? Charge the same for every order, and pay drivers \"boosts\" in minimum increments of a half hour. So what happens is every Friday or Saturday night, there will be a \"2$ boost\" on all orders from 5pm-9pm. But let's say the system is still saturated at 6pm - then they add a boost from 6pm-9pm for another dollar. But if it dies at 7pm, they can't take the boost off. And if it's overloaded on a Sunday, they basically never add one no matter what. I suspect this is because they don't have an algorithm, they have people they pay to look at network data live and make decisions (poorly).\n\n**2) They don't know how to run a fucking business**\n\nRepeatedly, I would be placed in situations where the simple and proper customer service thing to do was A, but because it saved half a dollar in the short run, I did B and fucked the customer over, because Doordash wouldn't pay me to do A.\n\nHere's an example. New Year's Eve, 230am. I get a double order from a Chinese restaurant. One going way North, one going way South. I live North past the North order, gonna go home after.\n\nThe way double orders work is that drivers get paid a little less, because it's only one pick up. No problem, that's fair!\n\nI get to the Chinese place. They have North order ready, but not South order. They say it will be 30 minutes for South order.\n\nI call Doordash support (more on them in a moment). I explain that the next customer's order will be delayed.\n\nHere are the possible outcomes :\n\nA) Out of the kindness of my heart, I waste my gas (and miss out on pay!) to make North Customer happy, I deliver his order right now, and then come back and get South Customer's order.\n\nB) I sit there for 30 minutes and let North Customer's order get (c)old because they won't pay me extra to deliver it separately, even though it's now two orders.\n\nWhat do you think happened? They wouldn't pay me. I'm an \"independent contractor\", I don't run a fucking Doordash customer charity. North Customer's order got cold. I'm sure he bitched and complained rightfully, and Doordash had to refund his food. Doordash saved 6$ by not paying me, only to probably lose this customer and lose the order's revenue anyways.\n\nLet's talk about support now. Every single restaurant I ever talked to regarding support would make me call about any issue, because the Restaurant Support line ALWAYS had a minimum 30 minute hold wait. They just didn't give a shit.\n\nI've dealt with Uber, DD, Instacart, lots of different support callcenters for this shit. DD hires the Phillipinos that don't speak english well enough to work at the Uber call centre. I would have to hang up 1/5 times I called and call again, because the person I got could not fucking understand what I was saying. I don't have some kind of weird speech impediment either I s2g.\n\nTheir support are total idiots too. Here's a good one.\n\nI try to deliver Chinese to some people. I hear loud music in their apartment. I knock ten times over 5 minutes. I text them twice. I call them three times in the same period. They won't come to the door.\n\nI leave and go do the next order. Support calls me back, says hey, can you go deliver that order? They said they're sorry. I said sure, i'm only a few blocks away anyways.\n\nI go back, same shit happens again, they don't come to the door. I leave again. Support calls me again 20 minutes later, I say this time I'm not going back unless they pay me extra, I've been back once for free already. Support says sure, we'll give you 5$.\n\nI go back, and deliver the food. This time, they come to the door to get it, and the most obviously fucking spun up meth-head i've ever seen comes to the fucking door. I tell support \"Yo, you should ban these ppl from the app, they're high as fuck and wasting my time\". Support says \"That's a good idea, it says here they say their order didn't get delivered like half the time, probably scamming\".\n\nNext week? I get an order from the same Chinese place to the same address, apartment number and all pop up in my app. Declined, so no problem for me. But DD? You can't ban cracked out scam artists who cost you money?\n\nI could go on and on. Essentially in most instances, Doordash support fails to protect the long term interests of the company, which screws over good customers and lets scam artistry run rampant.\n\nMy friends are all hipster foodie millennials and Doortrash has the reputation among ALL OF THEM as the least reliable app, where the app doesn't work, their food goes missing or ends up 3hrs late for no reason. Nobody likes it.\n\n**Doordash is what happens when someone starts a competitor, hoping to get bought out, and then they never get bought. Corona happens and they decide \"oh, maybe we can IPO then and that's how we get rich and get out of this mess?\"**\n\nTL;DR SHORT DOORTRASH\n\nPositions, all stock, will be shorting DD with my GME profits soon enough.\n\nGME, REDACTED SHROOM RELATED PENNYSTOCKS, BPY.UN, VDY", "author_fullname": "t2_5ohc2su2", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Why you should Short DOORTRASH", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_k8wgu9", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 222, "total_awards_received": 2, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 222, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1607426955.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I worked for Doordash for nearly two years.
