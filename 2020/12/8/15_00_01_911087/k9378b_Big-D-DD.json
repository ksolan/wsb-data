The problem is that eventually can be a very long time. The [M2 money stock](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2) has been posted multiple times already but rarely are the [M1 stock](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1) and the [MZM stock.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MZM) MZM is the Money Zero Money stock and indicates the value of the M2 supply minus small denomination time deposits plus institutions. It gives us a better picture of what the big players are doing with their cash reserves that the M2 doesn't show. Combining all three [graphs](https://i.redd.it/lks874atux361.png) together show us the total inflation of money supply over time.  \n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Why Do These Matter?**  \n&nbsp;\n\n\nWe can look at the major indices and see that they follow each other pretty accurately over time [raw](https://i.redd.it/zik8tmjbyx361.png) but to see it more cleanly, here's the same info against a [log scale.](https://i.redd.it/djsjckhwnx361.png) Now we can see that according to all of these charts that not only do stocks always go up, but we also have plenty of room for them to go up further.

Looking at the [mortgage delinquency rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRSFRMACBS) we can see that come Jan 1st, we're going to potentially have a slew of bankruptcies as homeowners get foreclosed upon. For those of you who've seen The Big Short, you'll know that mortgage backed securities are still widely used and how it doesn't take high percentages of defaults to detonate them. The problem the first time was giving mortgages to people who wouldn't qualify for a payday loan. This time, the ineffective measures taken by the gov mean many otherwise credit worthy individiuals are now sub-prime, through no fault of their own.  \n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Why This Falls Apart**  \n&nbsp;\n\n\nNow that we've got some background info. We can look at the [buffett indicator](https://i.redd.it/8g9mhit24y361.png) to see that the equity markets are insanely overvalued. Here's where hard data stops and my conjecture starts. We currently have a market heated to dot-com levels. That by itself doesn't mean anything. We didn't have the fed actively screwing with the bond market then. JPOW and presumably Janet Yellen remain committed to infinite QE to protect busisness from the slightest risk of bankruptcy. What they can't do is give money directly to people. This creates the situation where we have a K-shaped recovery actively happening. It works great, as long as average people can service their debt. The problem comes in on Jan 1st when the insulation of the CARES act ends and Congress currently doesn't seem interested in getting another round of stimulus going. \n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**What Does That Mean For The Market?**  \n&nbsp;\n\n\nIf Congress doesn't see fit to bestow upon the plebs some Trump/Biden bux we can see that we'll likely see widespread housing defaults/foreclosures. Most people don't like to be homeless, especially in winter, so anyone who's in that situation who also has stock holdings would be highly motivated to sell to afford to pay their now urgent mortgage. The MBSs securitizing these mortgages will crumble if enough households fail to raise the cash to pay off their loan as a result. This can be entirely averted if stimmy happens and even if it doesn't, it's unlikely that all of this will happen before late Feb-March.
