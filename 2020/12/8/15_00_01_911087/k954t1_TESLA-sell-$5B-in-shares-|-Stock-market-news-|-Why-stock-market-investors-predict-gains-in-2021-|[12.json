So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/zn9tpLg) down by half a percent, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/p4M2n7J) down 0,2% while the tech heavy [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/wKwCKwg) outperformed, finishing up 0,45 and closing yet again at a new record high. We did see the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/MNPsRvH) going higher, as more uncertainty puts some pressure on the markets with the stimulus and government funding bill on the [table](https://ibb.co/wzM6bt0). \n\nWe saw a bigger [ratio](https://ibb.co/TWQQdcx) of companies losing ground yesterday as small caps and especially growth companies outperformed the value plays [yesterday](https://ibb.co/DVpQVkH) with gains being made only in Technology, Utilities and Communications [sectors](https://ibb.co/BrbBWSV) while Energy was the biggest loser as the illness still keeps the pressure on the Oil business.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/fDSSmKp) from yesterday as 3 of the big FAANG names outperformed the market yesterday, with Apple being up more than 1% while FB and NFLX did even better up 2 and 3,5% for the day. You can also see a lot of red in this map as not many companies did good yesterday except big tech names.\n\nSo, some TESLA [news](https://ibb.co/QpNsY6H), yesterday the company spiked to a new all time high at over 640$ as the stock soared over 7% again. The stock has gone up more than 200$ in the last [month](https://ibb.co/xJp0QmJ) as more and more people are buying shares in anticipation of the SP500 inclusion and more and more analysts raise price target and expectations for the company. Tesla also just [announced](https://ibb.co/CJLCnW9) a sell of shares worth of $5B again as the company continues to raise more capital to fund the new factories and firm up the balance sheet while reducing the debt of the company.  I think this a good time to be careful and maybe take some profits in this stock before next week, as many people may end up selling shares on the 18th and 21st and we might see a  correction  instead of a spike in price when the company is included in the SP500. aka \\[buy the news/sell the event\\] [NEWS](https://ibb.co/1ZLmb8w) \n\nSome of the economic data that we received yesterday was worse than expected as the home purchase sentiment [index](https://ibb.co/fYW7jYD) rising streak ended this month with a dip of 1.7 points and is down more than 11 points year over year.\n\nWhile the TD Ameritrade Investor Movement [index](https://ibb.co/N1mkxK7) down from the previous month as investors both more Apple, Tesla and AT&T shares while selling Moderna, Beyond Meat and Micron.\n\nAlso, the small business optimism [index](https://ibb.co/FVg3827) dipped more than expected and fell to 101,2, down from 104 in October.\n\nSo, a recent survey from Investopedia [shows](https://ibb.co/hFcyKCM) that over 20% of investors are expecting gains of at least 10% for next year with more than \u00be expecting that 2021 will be another positive year for the stock market.\n\nMost investors [expect](https://ibb.co/1sRKWyt) the biggest gains to be made in the US equities while CHINA and other emerging markets are the next to follow with the Eurozone expected to lag.\n\nWhile this individual investors [expect](https://ibb.co/dj9LbN9) the large cap tech companies to continue to have big gains followed by pharma and health companies. I think this is a recency bias, as I don\u2019t think any one sector will largely outperform next year, with lots of gains to be made everywhere once the full reopening of the economy will begin. [Jim Cramer Quote](https://ibb.co/pL2v0bm)\n\nI think investors are pretty bullish as the AAII [survey](https://ibb.co/wBhx0Fb) showed last week, I think this might be a problem for the stock market. I don\u2019t think the stock market will go up as fast as investors would like, and this might push more of them into more and more risk taking, especially the new investors, which desire to make a fortune fast. I expect the stock market to be higher by this time next year, but the rate of which it will go up is still going to scare some investors off. As the market sentiment is way into euphoria [levels](https://ibb.co/rvzbx3R) as you can see in this survey, with retail investors being more powerful than ever before as they account for about 20% of the stock market activity on average daily.\n\nWe also might see some turbulence in the next couple of months until things will become more stable with the economy, vaccines, politics and everything else with the smart money [index](https://ibb.co/P6VJTQ0) continues to drop while stocks reach new highs, this might be the time to take a wait and see approach and maybe try to buy the dips when they come.\n\nSome good [news](https://ibb.co/Q6WXNtp) came early today the first ever recipient of the public vaccine from Pfizer has been vaccinated today in the UK, this is the start of the rollout of the vaccine in the UK and it is expected that the US will follow in the next couple of weeks. As the \u201cvaccine summit\u201d will be in full [display](https://ibb.co/t3zYjJ6) this week. This is great news for the entire world.\n\nOn some individual stock news, the darling of the moment Lemonade just [launched](https://ibb.co/F8FLjgF) in its 3rd EU country, in France following the Netherlands and Germany launches.\n\nWhile the 2 big [IPOs](https://ibb.co/23ZKRbh) will come on Thursday as both AirBNB and DoorDash are expected to go public at insanely high valuations.\n\nAfter the close today we will get [Chewy](https://ibb.co/mbPdtQx) earnings results and I expect the company to dazzle to crush this as pets have become more and more popular this year.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!
