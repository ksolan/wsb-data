The shift from offline to online for vehicle sales appears to have hit a position point of inflection. This was happening before Covid due to desire for transparency, broader unit selection, and general convenience. While autos are still only \\~1% online, Covid has been a catalyst that has normalized online vehicle sales, and it\u2019s one of those things that is here to stay. (Like video conferences.) Vroom will be able to help drive the shift to online by leveraging their national scale. This allows them to aggregate demand and create a central marketplace in what is a highly fragmented market. Mom and pop dealerships will lose share as a result \u2013 they won\u2019t be able to keep up with the broad selection at the Vroom\u2019s and Carvana\u2019s of the world.\n2. **Marketing**. Vroom has demonstrated its ability to create meaningful value through their marketing efforts. In winter of 2019, their campaign increased revenue share from its website increased from 26% to 43%. These direct sales are higher ROI than using performance marketing (where folks often have a take rate on directed traffic), and are a real value-add in a business model where advertising performance is a differentiator among competition due to the fragmentation of the industry.\n3. **Ability to add and cross-sell products**. Moving into financing and assurance products like VSCs, GAP insurance, and tire & wheel packages provide another meaningful avenue of growth for Vroom. Carvana has seen success here, and it is a natural next move as Vroom continues to grow and diversify its revenue streams\n4. **Mix shift on Vehicle Reconditioning Centers.** Vroom has begun building shifting its vehicle reconditioning centers to third party services. As volumes increase, they are able to achieve more attractive take rates, providing an additional stream of revenue. Vroom currently uses partners for 40-60% of reconditioning. Lowering the overhead footprint that comes with fully-owned VRC\u2019s presents furth room for margin expansion.\n5. **Increasing consumer-sourced vehicles.** As Vroom has begun to build out its name, they expect to shift more towards sourcing vehicles straight from consumers. This is a higher margin opportunity than sourcing vehicles from dealers/auctions, and will provide not only volume growth for the top line, but improve the margin profile going forward.\n6. **Vroom is outperforming competition on driving traffic to its website compared to CarMax, and is efficiently competing on app downloads**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/swhm2r8jsw361.png?width=421&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5254c90ae6eae5f7a2a6a57f7babb67363e58d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ohx6788ksw361.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecc8b7184bf785d65493862378a4ba569091d91c\n\n**Recent Performance and Outlook**\n\nReflecting its very early stage of growth, Vroom\u2019s e-commerce units sold grew at more than 80% last year and are poised to do so again in 2020 despite a slowdown in growth after the pandemic struck in March (units more than doubled year-over-year in each of the three quarters ended March 2020). While the company currently working through some friction on sales support given the volume has increased so much, brokers expect growth in e-commerce units sold to re-attain its pre-pandemic pace of more than doubling year-over-year by the second quarter of 2021, translating into an acceleration in e-commerce units sold to roughly 120% next year.
