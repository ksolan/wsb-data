I&#39;m a massive Afterpay bull and rode it from $14 to $96 so I might be a bit biased. My plan is to cash out a bit under half my Afterpay and go with Affirm since IMO Affirm is carving out a strong niche and has great partnerships. They both have great long-term potential, but there&#39;s probably a chance to capitalise on short-term hype with Affirm right now.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k96yrw/the_affirm_ipo_and_a_new_way_to_rip_people_off/gf2eb8r/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_gf2eb8r", "created": 1607473748.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1607444948.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "replies": [{"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_k96yrw", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gf2jd8g", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": {"name": "speakers7", "fullname": "t2_10abab"}, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gf2eb8r", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_10abab", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "collapsed": false, "body": "Good pints here.
