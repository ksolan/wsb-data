{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "So I accidently did a DD today, inspired by the sources of this [Washington Post Story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/07/unemployed-debt-rent-utilities/). The numbers behind on mortgage/rent come from [This Census Survey](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/demo/hhp/hhp19.html#tables). The unpaid rent/mortgage number comes from [a Philly Fed Study](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/community-development/reports/household-rental-debt-during-covid-19.pdf) estimate that the average household behind will owe ~$5,800 and multiplying it by the census numbers for behind on rent/mortgage. The real numbers may be as low 1/3 that of my estimate, but $100 billion makes for a good title. The census numbers lag a few weeks (Nov 11-23) so there also the possibility that I have slightly underestimated. \n\nLooking at the numbers a different way, in terms of the numbers of people eligible for eviction/foreclosure come Jan 1 when the national moratorium is lifted, the Nov 11-23 numbers represent a 45+ day delinquency. We get close to 70 million people using the raw household numbers from the census data, multiplied by the household size. One mitigating factor here is that some lenders are choosing to tack on owed mortgage payments to end the of the loan instead of seeking immediate repayment. Assuming half of the ~~30 million~~ 8 million delinquent mortgages are given the option to defer payments to the end of the loan the total numbers fall to ~55 million people or roughly 1/6 of the US population. The other mitigating factor is the patchwork of local and state eviction moratoriums in many of the large cities and populous costal states, which account for roughly 2/3rds of the population. This result is better but still grim, between 15-20 million up for eviction, concentrated in areas without eviction moratoriums where the eviction rate will be roughly 1 in 6. Many forced from their homes will never make a significant contribution to the economy ever again, those that do it will be years before they get back on their feet.\n\nAnother metric to look at is the value of the housing that the tens of billions in missed rent/mortgage payments represent. Doing quick and dirty math of 300k median housing price times 17 million households gives the astonishing $5.1 trillion in toxic residential assets. Using 2/3rds to account for the lower per unit cost of apartments and condos that's still $3.5 trillion and who knows what multiple of that number is tied up in MBSs and derivatives dependent on those loans. This also doesn't account for the lost value as millions of vacant houses and apartments start flooding every market without an eviction moratorium. \n\nnote: I'm not expecting a new Stimulus bill before the 116th congress adjourns, so I'm not considering its effects. Both sides keep drawing lines in the sand the other wont cross, and have been for 7 months. Or put another way, we ain't getting shit with DOW@30k. Even if the eviction moratorium gets extended all we're doing is driving further up the mountain before driving off the cliff. \n\nTL;DR: Tens of Billions of missed payments, trillions in toxic assets, millions becoming homeless starting Jan 1, millions of evections starting Jan 1, a flood of vacant units destroying rental and property prices, cats and dogs living together, it's September 1929, only all the speakeasies are closed. \n\nOh yeah, I haven't even considered commercial properties.\n\nPositions: \n\nShares: SPY, QQQ, EFA, GLD, SIL, DWCPF, BA, GE.\n\nBets: GPS, CPRI, PLNT PUTS\n\nHedges: VIX rolling 4-6 week $20C.\n\nEdit: My \"conclusions\" in the TLDR were intended to be tongue in cheek, I just found these numbers to be far worse than I had anticipated and thought they should be shared.", "author_fullname": "t2_d5zan", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "American households $100 billion behind on rent and mortgage.
