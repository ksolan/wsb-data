{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Hi tards,\n\nI believe that PTON is the next 2014 GoPro. If you remember 2014 GoPro was trying to tout thembselves of as a tech company, a social media company, a brand of sorts, and more. I believe they were trying to tell people they were going to also be a drone company. Stonk was soaring. I remember thinking this is just a fucking camera company. All they make is a above average to low premium camera. Why are the large camera companies of the world not crushing them. Well turns out the company was actually valued at around 5 bucks eventually. I believe the same will happen to PTON. It may not go to 5 bucks but I believe it could definitely go to 30-40 dollas by the fibinachi bands. My take is boat loads of people are not going to purchase a 2-4k dollar bike that does not even move. This is during a pandemic where money is supposedly tight. They also have lots of people aggressively fighting for market share aka ... Nordictrack, Mirror thing, Apple, Plain old normal bikes.\n\nI dont see them as a tech company or a social media company. I see them as a fad excercise equimpement. Half of going to the gym is actually going to the gym. Most people never work out as well at home. This bike will be ridden by my fat wife Becky for a few months then after that it will go in the corner. After a few more months I will trip over it and move it to the garage. After a few more months of pay the subsription I will cancel it. After a year or so my wife even fatter than before will now drag the bike out of the garage for a couple weeks and watch spin class from youtube on her ipad or phone. After a few months the bike will go back in the garage where it will stay for another few years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; PTON is the shakeweight of stonks. It is a meme in it self. It is what happens when you put 20in rims on your stationary bike and bolt on a 50in Plasma.
