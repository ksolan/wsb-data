{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I posted this on stocktwits and in another comment thread, but given the feedback I've received, I thought I would create a new post to let this august community think Deep Thoughts about all of this as we approach the moment of truth.  I'm not a social media guy so I usually don't get how all this shit works - just a 40-year-old lawyer who hates his job and sees a ticket out.  Do your own DD and figure your own shit out.  But the time is drawing nigh here for GME.\n\nTo start, I have 20,000 shares and 570 April 20/25Cs across three separate accounts. I also picked up about 100 calls for Jan/late Dec this week just for the hell of it (fuck IV crush when you\u2019re boarding a rocket). I'm holding them all through ER. This could prove to be folly or it could make me very rich. I\u2019ll know pretty soon.\n\nI know there has been some discussion of this here and there, but I find the psychological profiles of the folks in this situation to be very interesting--particularly because both Sherman (current CEO) and Cohen know that, fundamentals aside, this thing is sitting on a powder keg with the short %. But first take Cohen. Boy genius who builds Chewy with his smarts and an ethos dedicated to care for the customer. Beats Amazon in this niche area because he outworked and outsmarted everyone. Worked super close with his Dad, who sounds like an amazing businessman with an old school ethic about treating customers/employees well. After building this juggernaut he sold it for 3Bil. Dude did all of this before he was 33. Then says screw diversification and YOLOs into Apple and Wells Fargo. Apple goes berzerk and splits and he makes more millions. All the while watching and waiting for something new to come around.\n\nAnd then almost exactly a year ago, Cohen\u2019s Dad dies. There are many interviews when he talks about this: his Dad was only 69 and he is barely 35 and that\u2019s early as shit to lose your father and best friend. Do not underestimate what that can do to someone and what lessons one might take from that or how that person feels now barely a year away from that happening. Cohen clearly reveres his Dad for his hard working ethic and how he taught him tenacity when you know you\u2019re right. So Cohen finds GME and he sees that this brilliantly set-up company in an explosive growth sector has been run into the ground by prior management. He thinks he knows the way out: the \u201cChewy-fication\u201d of GameStop \u2013 efficient, customer-focused ecommerce sector domination. So he takes a big stake and then talks to Sherman and explains what needs to happen to save this company.\n\nAnd if the letter he sent last month reflects reality and is not posturing, Cohen is rebuffed a bit. Maybe Boomer Sherman doesn\u2019t like the cut of his jib and patronizes him. Maybe Cohen didn\u2019t like Sherman\u2019s focus on short term profit at the expense of building long-term customer loyalty (the one of two trucks his Dad talks about, which Cohen cites frequently in his interviews). Who knows. But whatever it was, being rebuffed seems to piss Cohen off--judging by the tone of that letter. Oh, and he\u2019s made it known that he has hired basically the top activist investor/takeover law firm and attorney in the country. So he puts Sherman in the hot seat: outline your plan to make GameStop what I know it can be as soon as possible. He knows Q3 earnings is in three weeks when he sends that letter. He\u2019s saying: Don\u2019t you let another conference call go by without outlining this plan. Or else.\n\nAnd the \u201cor else\u201d is of course all speculative. But I do not think that the \u201cor else\u201d is Cohen selling his shares and sulking home pissed off that these mean Boomers didn\u2019t do things the way he wanted them to do. No, I think this guy drinks Sherman\u2019s fucking milkshake, takes this thing and shows the world how it\u2019s done. He\u2019s got the eye of the tiger, he\u2019s still in that young and crushing it phase. He\u2019s got his Dad, his Obi-Wan, guiding him on this. So he\u2019s going to do this right. This is his moment and I think he sees that. He\u2019s watching his baby Chewy with a MC of $30B. He knows he can do that or better with GME. And he is not going to take no for an answer.\n\nThen take Sherman. Dude has been Mr. Big Shot Hired-Gun CEO for a while now. Brought in to right this ship and Be The Man. And just as he starts to turn around this company\u2014the moment he has been waiting for these difficult past 1.5 years (THE NEW CONSOLES ARE HERE!) this Chewy billionaire startup bro who is probably the same age as his children comes in and starts trying to tell \\*him\\* how to run a major public corporation. The nerve of this kid. Then, to make things worse, as Sherman prepares for the console release season and the Q3 earnings call, Cohen writes a scathing public letter attached to his 13D that calls out GameStop for being run by idiots and calls out Sherman specifically for being an out-of-touch boomer who doesn\u2019t know the value of what he even has or what to do with it.\n\nAnd this kid demands another strategic review and a public response on the obvious direction that Sherman needs to take the company. Sherman is not dumb. He knows who Cohen\u2019s attorney is and he knows what Cohen is implying in that letter and the money Cohen has. Sherman now knows that the time he has to show shareholders he can turn this thing around has now shrunk. It\u2019s go time. New consoles are out, Q4 numbers are likely to be through the roof and you have to address shareholders for the Q3 earnings call \u2013 one that everyone knows is likely to be a dud since it was pre-console cycle. So it\u2019s a gimmie on numbers anyway. What self-respecting Master of the Universe hired gun Boomer CEO would just wilt under this pressure and fail to give every possible piece of good news to try to show shareholders his worth? The wolf is at the door and wants you in the unemployment line because you\u2019re out of touch. Do you go quietly into the night?\n\nOr do you give this punk-ass Millennial Start Up Bro a lesson that You Don\u2019t Mess With the Shermanator? It would be an extraordinary act of self-sabotage if Sherman gave some cagy milquetoast guidance along with some middling Q3 numbers. It\u2019s almost unthinkable. If GameStop has something good to talk about tomorrow, I\u2019m guessing we hear all about it loud and clear. All Sherman\u2019s incentives \u2013 financial, ego \u2013 point to him trying to knock it out of the park with Q4 guidance. If Sherman doesn\u2019t take this golden opportunity to show his worth and start this squeeze, he deserves everything that\u2019s coming to him. But even though I\u2019d jump at the chance to see Cohen at the helm long term, I\u2019m guessing he gives it his all since the possible outcomes aren\u2019t hard see here. We will know soon if Sherman is a dead man walking or the temporary Hero and Savior of Gamestock, first of his name. And all the while, Mr. Moneybags Ecommerce Boy Genius watches and waits.\n\nThis is going to be fun to watch, to say the least.\n\nEDIT:  After that call and the shelf, Sherman clearly deserves none of the credit I gave him here.  The company is solid and will be fine and everyone with shares and April calls should be AOK.  Lots of positive stuff.  But Sherman miscalculated horribly with the shelf.  Cohen is going to rip Sherman's fucking heart out and make him watch, Temple of Doom Style.
