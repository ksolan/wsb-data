With the established applications. \n\n**C3.AI is then able to** \n\n**1.** **Expand those same use cases across similar companies**\n\n**2.** **Establish middle market sales organizations, including tele sales, and online sales**\n\n**3.** **Leverage on marketing partners as enterprise and mid-market distribution channels**\n\nReal world user case:\n\nEngie \u2013 largest power producer in the world with\n\n\\- 114.4 GW power production capacity\n\n\\- $67 billion annual revenue in europoors money\n\n\\- 153k employees, operated in 70 counties \n\nWith the partnership with Engie, C3.Ai developed and deployed performance optimization for gas power plants, efficiency optimization of heating and cooling plants, energy analysis and management for enterprise and consumer customers, and anomaly detection of wind turbines. **C3 was able to bring the scalability required to build industrial AI based application with over 1million sensors, 5 million end points and 17mil measurements per day with the end result of bringing estimated 1.5 billion in annual economic benefits**\n\n\\- Wind turbines with in 12 weeks of deployment sees 2-3% increase in performance resulting in 15-22Mil annual economic value\n\n\\- Heating and cooling plants see 2-3% saving in energy consumption costs with $3mil annual economic value\n\n\\- Application in analyze energy for metered facility on the Ohio State university campus and is expected to see 25% energy saving within 10 years within 16 weeks of deployment \n\n\\- Application to analyze and forecast consumption for electricity and gas retail customers in France of 2.6Mil electricity consumers and 8.6mil has consumers with deployment of 6 months \n\n**Revenue model**\n\n\\- **Term subscriptions of the C3.AI Suite**\n\n\\- **Term subscriptions of C3.AI applications**\n\n\\- **Monthly runtime fee of C3 AI Applications and customer-developed application built using the C3.AI suite, usage based upon CPU- hour consumption**\n\n\\- **Professional services fees associated with training and assisting customers**\n\nIn the case of Engie, C3.AI would be making money from subscriptions to C3.AI suite and applications, setting up required trackers for measurements, developing AI applications, a monthly runtime fee if Engie is continuing to develop new applications with C3.AI.
