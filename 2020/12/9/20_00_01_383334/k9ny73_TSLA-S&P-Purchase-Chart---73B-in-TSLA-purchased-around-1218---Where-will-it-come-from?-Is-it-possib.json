{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "All funds, ETFs, etc that directly track the S and P have to buy TSLA on or around the 18th. The majority will be purchased directly on the 18th. almost **15% of TSLA Float** will be bought on or around the 18th. Locking it up for as long as it is in the S and P.\n\n**Can They Buy Enough TSLA on 12/18?**\n\nWhen only counting S&P and tracking index funds / ETFs, at current Tesla Price, they are scheduled to purchase **$73 Billion in TSLA.**\n\nThis gets progressively larger, as the price increases.\n\n[TSLA Price Changes Changes S and P inclusion purchasing](https://preview.redd.it/qsv4203674461.jpg?width=741&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=deebe56d8351bcd988ac5698ae07ddf8c86b1d87)\n\nThey have to buy 113+ Million shares, or about **15% of all available shares.**\n\n**How are they going to do it?**\n\n1. **Institutional Investors - 52.96%** [Institutional investors](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=TSLA&subView=institutional) Hold 402M Shares\n2. **ETFs - 4.6%** \\- 35M Shares. These aren't for sale. Example QQQ owns 10M shares - [165 ETFs that control 17B of TSLA](https://www.etf.com/stock/TSLA)\n3. **Retail Investors - 42.4% -** The rest I assume.\n\n**What percent of this TSLA can actually be traded on or about the 18th?**\n\n**ETFs can't sell** their shares, they are tracking something, they just can't sell TSLA.\n\nI believe less then **20% of the retail investor shares will be available.** The rest are held by people that won't even log into an investment account on 12/18 or next week at all. Think of retirement funds, long term investors, etc.\n\nThis would mean that **64M** TSLA shares might be available for purchase from retail investors --if the price is right. I don't think these investors are going to liquidate at the current stock price. They are still holding for a reason.\n\nThen there are institutional controlled shares, I believe that a lot of those shares are locked up, think of mutual funds, and investment groups. Baring an emergency they must have meetings and votes on what they trade. It takes weeks or months for many of them to divest in one area and invest in another. They aren't setup to switch strategies at a moments notice, especially for a stock that is having a rally. Also, Think of funds that are filled with just manufacturing or car companies, etc. They won't decide to exclude TSLA for a day / week / month because the price is too high.\n\nSome of the institutional investors have had TSLA for a long time, they have already decided that they want to keep it, and aren't ready to part with it just because it has a high value.\n\nAlso look at Capital Group management and Vanguard Fund, together they control about 10% of TSLA (15% of float) and I'm assuming it is intermixed within many of their combined 170 mutual funds they control. I can't imagine that they can divest TSLA from most of the places they have it stashed on one day. Maybe they already have started, but I doubt it.\n\nI think less then  **40%** of the institutional shares will be available on Dec 18th, I think this would be a very 'high' estimate. I also think that the price would have to be North of 750 for these people to think of liquidating. They have TSLA for a reason, and it has done very well for them, a lot of them sold some shares last quarter, and I bet they regret it now.\n\nThat would mean **161M** Shares might be available from Institutional Investors, if the price goes astronomical.\n\n**225M Shares actually available on 12/18 (Based on my guesses) - THEY NEED 113M+ and the price will be sky high to get that number.**\n\nI think that it would be very expensive to get 113M shares out of the grips of investors. I think there will be huge profit taking, but I don't think people are going to be willing to liquidate all of their positions. Sell off 10 - 20% sure, but 100% without a 2 -3X increase from the week before seems unlikely, remember, these are **TSLA HOLDERS, they have held for 700% increases this year.**\n\nThere is a speed that this has to be done at as well, Even if only 80% has to be done on the 18th, They have to buy **13.9M+ SHARES ( $9B @ 650) PER TRADING HOUR**, if they take an hour off to let the price slow down, they have to **double** it the next hour to keep up with the pace. 3 - 4pm when they are looking at how far they still have to go is going to be a ***B******lood Bath***. Yes some funds can invest a few days before, but it's a small percentage of them, and it still doesn't change the fact that between now and then 113M shares minimum need to be locked away.\n\nAlso, think of all the shares that are used as collateral on options. Writing Covered Calls, when the price surges, you probably don't want to liquidate your covered call and sell your shares. They are probably just going to stay tied up, after all, with selling a covered call, you don't benefit from the upward spike in price, your betting the stock will settle down and you get to keep the call premium. TSLA has had immense options activity, and you have to imagine with high Theta, there are a lot of people who enjoy writing covered calls now.\n\n**Wildcard 1: Short sellers**, if there are any TSLA short sellers out there, and IF they can find shares to rent, that aren't sold on the 18th, they could sell short to cover what's needed. But as they watch the stock skyrocket, how willing are they going to be to write those shorts, and if they get liquidated later in the day from a margin call from a skyrocketing stock, those shares have to be replaced from the open market.\n\nI am a little worried about holding 12/18 call debit spreads, I would be worried that they are going to execute the short end early on me to get the shares they need, and making a mess in my account.\n\n**Wildcard 2: Options**, What happens if investment firms start buying options just to exercise them and get the shares? Naked Short Calls will be popped at the worst times, causing market orders to be placed and force buying all over the place. There will be margin calls that require short stocks to be covered, etc. I can see chaotic price increases. \n\n**Bullets Dodged on this crazy run:** I highly doubt that Tesla will offer another group of stock for sale before the 18th, I believe that this was a signal that this is the only offering they will be making in December, they don't have a history of selling new groups of shares every couple weeks.\n\nThe S&P declared that they didn't want to mess up their largest stock addition by doing it in stages. They want it all done on one day.\n\n**Do they care about the price paid? Won't this hurt the S&P? Won't the people in charge refuse to pay the high price?** Not really, They manage an unimaginable amount of money. TSLA is going to make up 1-3% of the S&P, so if they have to overspend by 50-100%, that only effects the index by a percent or two.  The index dropping 2% - its called a Tuesday. TSLA on the short term doesn't effect the index much.\n\nTheir biggest concern is properly running the ETF / index. they have to stewardship the index properly.  Not buying at whatever the price is exactly how they announced it would be done weeks ago is the only thing that would hurt their jobs at this point. **THEY WILL BUY AT A FURY PACE ALL DAY. They just have to buy the right amount of shares.** \n\n**S and P Benchmarked Funds:** There are another **6.6T** in funds that are **Benchmarked** to the S and P, but they are actively traded, and they aren't going to be required to buy shares on the 18th. Some, are already buying shares, those shares will most likely be unavailable for the 18th. This could easily add another **25M - 50M more shares** to be purchased on or around 12/18.\n\n**One last thing to consider:** Remember, There are long term investors all over the planet. Look at this study that says  [ Almost 1% of TSLA is held in S. Korea alone](https://observer.com/2020/08/tesla-stock-fueled-by-korea-retail-investor-apple-microsoft-amazon-tech/#:~:text=As%20of%20Friday%2C%20Korean%20retail,were%20first%20reported%20by%20Bloomberg).
