This also isn't a revolutionary thesis, \"we need stimmy!\" but I wanted to breakdown why it's important, at least in my view.\n\n**Long story short:** the importance of this year's booming rally has largely hinged on: a)increased liquidity through FED repo lending mechanisms and b) dramatically increased consumer opportunities created by enhanced UI benefits, and where people chose to spend it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**1) The rise and fall of FED liquidity via short term loans**\n\nFor those who were around in the halcyon days of the late spring and early summer, we witnessed SPY do some amazing things together.\u00a0 For review, I noted two specific mechanisms that were largely behind the barrage of green dildos raining down daily:\n\n**1a.) *Free money repo operations**:* to simplify it, this is the process by which financial entities borrow money from each other for overnight asset purchases; it's a closed, short term loan ecosystem.\u00a0 This became a bloated and expensive process in 2019, leading to somewhat of a mini-crisis, and the FED stepped in to offer their own low interest short-term loans. When the March crash came, the FED sent this lending vehicle into hyperdrive, throwing hundreds of billions of dollars a week into low interest short-term loan operations for banks.\u00a0 How low?\n\n**Free. They were offering overnight swaps with banks, using treasury as collateral, and charging ZERO additional interest on them.**\n\n[Typical Repo operation early 2020](https://i.imgur.com/TmbUXrR.jpg)\nyou see, IOER plus ZERO BASIS POINTS.\u00a0 *Literally, free money.*\n\nSince the Spring, SPY has petered out.  Up and down, boomer-esque gains have replaced the BTD logic of summer.  Below is the difference in price and percent for the first trading day in each month compared to the last.\u00a0 Things got shaky in the fall. (note that it is typically assumed that FED balance sheet adjustments take about one-two months to show results, good or bad)\n\nMay to June: 280.43/303 = 8%\nJune to july: 303/ 309.28= 2% (note below)\n\nJuly to August (3) = 309.28/ 328.74= **6.2%**\n\nAugust to September= 328.74/ 351.19= **6.8%**\n\nSeptember to October = 351.19/ 337.04= **-4.19%**\n\nOctober to November = 337.04/ 330.20= **2%**\n\nNovember to December= 330.20/ 366.02= **10.84%** (note below)\n\n**The 3 days preceding and following the election were responsible for 7.3% of the November rise, so Nov is something of an outlier. The 2% in June came due to the crash, which was caused by the very thing I'm solidifying--a change in the Fed overnight loan terms)\n\nAlso since the Spring, the amount of people participating in overnight Repo operations has petered out.\u00a0 Why? Because it's not longer free money.\u00a0 **The FED's bread and butter liquidity operation for short term loans changed their interest terms.\u00a0 [This is so important that it was the largest catalyst for the June crash.\u00a0 Stories broke on the 10th and 11th that the Fed would be\u00a0 \"tweaking\" the overnight lending rates](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-repo-idUSKBN23I39Z), from the \"free money\" 0 points over IOER to 5 points over on the overnight, and 10 points on the term.** Do the math; if the story breaks on the 11th stating the FED would be increasing the rate on their overnight loan operations, and the Street catches wind likely a day or two before that...what do you think causes the crash on the 11th?\u00a0 The FED program has been steadily increasing to a standard +10 interest charge.\n\nSo, the FED has dried up it's free money overnight lending, an it would seem to coincide with SPY slowing down.\n\n**1b.) The end of double pump Tuesdays**\nOnce upon a time I wrote about the \"Double Pump\"--typically on Tuesday--when the FED would offer both term AND overnight repo operations on the same day, at the IOER +0 (free money) rate.\u00a0 However, once the interest rate climbed to +5 points it became obsolete; it's more common to see zero takers on repo/reverse repo operations than it is to see more than one taker, nowadays.\u00a0 Tuesdays were guaranteed green at a 90% rate--and then FED lending practices changed, and poof.\n\nThe details of all this shit is boring, but the point is this: once the COVID crash hit, in order to grease the wheels to getting the market back on track the FED was employing multiple avenues to give financial entities money to play with mostly via its absurdly low-cost loan swap programs.\n\n\nThese repo lending programs becoming more expensive are apart of a larger general trend; the shrinking FED balance sheet.\u00a0 Although in recent months they have lightly picked spending back up, we have flatlined from the huge jump we saw in March and April in response to the pandemic.\u00a0\n\n[FED balance sheet YTD 2020](https://i.imgur.com/znnvilS.jpg)\nLook at that level-off, this shit matters\n\n**2) Stimulus play money go bye-bye**\nStimmy pumps aren't much, unless you're betting 0DTE, but the underlying importance of an economic stimulus that benefits consumers is. There are three simple measures signifying it's importance as a liquidity pump:\n\n**2a.) Consumer spending**: when the stimulus began to hit in April/May, we saw a huge jump in consumer spending.\u00a0 You remember the lines at WMT and TGT and shit.\u00a0 In June, for example, consumer spending was expected to increase a little less than 2%--it went higher than 6%.\n\n**2b.) Credit Card Debt begone**: people had so much extra money from the stimulus they paid off their credit cards https://www.wsj.com/articles/consumers-flush-with-stimulus-money-shun-credit-card-debt-11596373201 .\u00a0 This is a clear indication that the stimulus funds were having a positive spending affect.\n\n**2c.) Consumer choices:** Used auto sales and home sales skyrocketed (link), indicating people were flush with excess cash for down payments, in addition to the ability to pay off debt.\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/during-covid-19-pandemic-the-used-car-lot-is-hot-11593774001\n\n**Conclusion**\nSo what the fuck am I saying?\u00a0 I'm saying that in order for the market to not reflect and react to current (horrid) employment and opportunity metrics--common measures of economic health being decimated by the COVID/lockdown return-- one of these two external liquidity injections must continue; FED balance sheet ultra expansion, or stimulus injection.\u00a0 While FED spending on QE is increasing slightly over the past few months, it's paltry in comparison March, April, and May, and is very unlikely to return to those levels.\u00a0 This is why in every speaking engagement Powell makes it clear: we need a stimulus.\n\nSo, the answer to which liquidity injection can continue is the stimulus. Specifically, the enhanced unemployment benefits that, coupled with eviction moratoriums and rent/mortgage deferment, allow consumer spending and credit debt relief on a mass scale.\u00a0 Regardless of the bickering, it is going to happen.\u00a0 The enhanced UI will happen, in particular, because more widespread lockdowns are going to hurt jobs numbers, thus lending the Dems the leverage they need.\u00a0 UI benefits are tied to employment, and even McConnell is acknowledging there is no way around that.\n\n**I see a lot of people talking about the stimulus in the daily thread, so here are some basics:**\n1) Direct payments are likely not happening this time, or at a depressed level (talk of $600)\n2) UI enhancements will be reinstated at at least $300 extra weekly, backdated to December 1st\n3) There will be another eviction moratorium extension, probably for 3, 4 months\n4) It doesn't matter what the white house wants--the chain of approval goes House vote (Nancy), then Senate vote (McConnell).\u00a0 Any vote in either house that hasn't been supported by the other chamber is DOA and pure political stunt.\n5) The big hangup is corporate liability protection for Democrats (businesses, schools, hospitals want lawsuit immunity from COVID cases) and State and Local Government Aid for the Democrats (money to be used at the discretion of localities, including social programming, policing, education).\n6) Its going to pass this negotiation cycle because it's tied to a government shutdown.\n\n\n**Positions: Arming for the next round of stimulus**\n\n\nSPY: stay away, honestly.\u00a0 Even after the initial pump, there will still be several rounds of voting needed, between committees and chambers, each with it's own bad news cycle days and good news cycle days.\n\n\nI'm also staying away from small cap trash and looking at companies who most benefit from restriction rules, integrated online systems well, or both.\u00a0 I had a good sense this dip was coming yesterday, so I'm loading up on these at EOD:\n\nStrong consumer-spending retail:\nWMT: 1/8 155c\nTGT: 1/8 180c\n\nConsumer electronics that boomed in lockdown 1:\n\nAAPL: 1/8 126c\nHPQ: 1/15 25c\n\nOnce people realize that telehealth is here to stay, TDOC merger is actually dope as fuck, and vaccine logistics are going to take forever:\nTDOC 12/24 200c\nTDOC 1/15 205c\n\nI just fucking like TOL, so \nTOL 1/15 46c\n\n**TLDR: To stave off a bear market reflecting wider economic conditions, we need a continuation of either 0 interest FED short-term loan programs or an economic stimulus\u2014stimulus is more likely.
