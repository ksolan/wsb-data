That makes Amazon, which he cites, only a book company.\n\nHe states its net income is in-line with peers. Where \"peers\" are companies that for the most part are not making or not even able to make EV's in quantity, nor achieve sufficient battery supply. But even the \"peers\" thought was true, the rest is false anyway. In fact, their net income is much higher and if you check out their 10Q's you can see that their margins are much better than their peers and their net income is only reduced due to offsetting expenses such as significant R&D and build-out expenses for factories along with liabilities such as FSD sales (which are liabilities on the books).\n\nHe quotes a laughably wrong and embarrassingly stupid forecast from Deloitte that there will only be 25M EV's by 2030. You know how long the transition from horses to gas vehicles took? Less than 13 years in major metropolitan areas. And that was 100 years ago. Adoption rates are significantly faster now. But Deloitte says that there will only be a quarter of the TAM each year as EV's in an entire decade? That's fucking ridiculous.\n\nI mean, seriously, who is going to be producing ICE engines in 2030? Would you? Would you have a line to produce ICE engines that will literally be illegal in 2030 and 2035 in many areas of the world? Nobody is that fucking stupid. They will migrate their lines or be undercut in price. And probably much earlier because who would buy an ICE car that would be banned a few years later? Nobody. Nobody is that fucking stupid.\n\nAnd his comment that he assumes a 50% market share is unnecessary and silly. They have an 18% market share and have maintained that consistently. Yes it will grow but his forecast is outrageous.\n\nAnd he assumes that their other businesses (their energy segment is growing massively -- does he not read the 10Q's?) are high risk -- I'm sorry but no -- when you have $10 billion dollars in the bank that mitigates risk considerably.\n\nAnd, like the automotive competition, he describes how Tesla has \"competiton\" (sic). They've been saying that old song for 10 years. Just give it up. Ford is still paying off a debt from 2008. GM is building a battery factory with LG in NJ and it won't have a fraction of Tesla's battery capacity. They won't maintain market share because they won't have product. It's that simple. \n\nApple is a good point, and when the Apple car is introduced Tesla stock will drop, but then recover as Apple won't be able to meet supply constraints and the inevitable teething problems, recalls, lawsuits and the user-pays $1000 for replacement spherical tires will cause the normal typical rebound for Tesla stock.\n\nAnd he describes EV's as an \"expensive good\" -- which is the same reason why we're all paying $1500 a month for T1 connections and the Internet will not succeed in most homes. There will be a $25,000 Tesla and the prices will continue to fall like in all new tech goods. Remember the adoption rate of the smartphone?\n\nHis final argument that cheaper gas will eat away at demand is just false. A car with 3500 more parts that is slower and smellier and costs more every month than the garage charging port costs only once, and doesn't cost $5 to fill up, will never be preferred. Gas cars will not be available new and prices will crash for used ICE cars.\n\nThe fact that he couldn't even spell check his video for \"competiton\" indicates how much depth he's gone into on Tesla.", "edited": 1609455585.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "actual retard"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Well that&#39;s definitely not a good analysis. </p>\n\n<p>He mixes forward looking statements with historical analysis for starters.
