Just like GME, most people don\u2019t understand WSB and have a negative view on us. They hear rumors, see glimpses and glorified headlines and make their opinion on WSB. \n\nAre we perfect? Hell no. Are we saints? Absolutely not. Do we have some bad apples who are cringeworthy that even we at WSB despise? Absolutely! WSB isn\u2019t for soft \u2744\ufe0f and the faint of heart individuals who take things at face value. \n\nThe truth is, just like GME, there is a lot of positives to us, but not everyone notices that and looks at both GME and WSB as pure evil. **Many are betting against GME and WSB.** Unfortunately for them, both are here to stay, and will become a greater presence as time goes on. \n\n\nHave you ever beat it up so good that months later  they contacted you back for a repeat? Well you haven\u2019t, but your wife can attest to this experience.\n\n**\u201cThe axe forgets what the tree remembers.\u201d**\n\nWe are going to hit Mel and other shorts twice. \n\nBefore I lose you since this will be a lengthy post with lofty goals of charity and coordinated social media presence...\n\nGME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\n\n\nThis is an attempt to coordinate our efforts and become a more powerful force to be reckoned with. \n\n##Speaking of Force, even Physics validates GME\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nYou see there is an equation for Newton\u2019s Law of Universal Gravitation. The law is that objects with greater masses have a greater (attraction) gravitational force. The attractive force is directly related to the mass of the objects, and inversely related to the distance between them. \n\nThe more massive the objects, the greater the force. The greater the distance, the less of the force. Want proof? Have you ever seen any chicks on my 600 lb life who is single? They all have a partner. Have you seen the 1000 lb sisters? One of them is currently pregnant. That means that someone, possibly one of you, managed to get her pregnant. \n\nThe law validates itself, the more massive you are, the more attractive you become. GME has been a massive target for shorts, it has been and will remain a huge attraction to shorts and bears. \n\nGME is so attractive, that Mel left GME for dead. They could\u2019ve closed positions, they weren\u2019t satisfied at $4. They want GME bankrupt. \n\nDon Ciccio was wise enough to order Vito to be killed when he was 9, but his foot soldiers weren\u2019t the best. In fact, when Vito\u2019s mom begged Don Ciccio to spare Vito who is \u201ddumb-witted and only 9 years old\u201d after having killed her husband and her oldest son who has vowed revenge; Don Ciccio responded \u201cwhen he becomes bigger, he will come for revenge and kill me.\u201d \n\nSo calling Mel Don Ciccio is an insult because Don Ciccio was wise to attempt to tie up loose ends, but the fate is the same. \n\nBack to Physics: The law and equation...\n\nThe equation (for Earth) is:\n\n#F = GMeM / Re^^2\n\n##Can you believe this???\n\nWe all know what Re means...but if they are scattered and too far from each other, the force is not as great. This is why we have to recruit and bring all the scattered individuals to join the cause. The closer the distance of Re, the greater the force. \n\n\n\nWith that said, not all forces are evil, and we will be benefiting many great causes. \n\nWe are the leading sub in gifting awards, by a landslide, and that\u2019s not even coordinated. Imagine if we did actually start to coordinate for our goals. \n\nFFS, **we may have set the record of most awards given to a post** for a post that said to buy shares instead of awards. \n\nPeople are aware of us....but they don\u2019t take us seriously. They notice us, they lurk for their headlines and etc, but they don\u2019t see the true power behind us. Every now and then, they may acknowledge or refer to us, but the reality is, it is always in a negative way. In fact, that\u2019s ok. We don\u2019t want to give the illusion that we do charities and donations to improve our \u201cimage.\u201d We are not like the powerful and famous people who do things for PR purposes. We are just your regular individuals who have a more giving heart then the people who look down upon us. \n\nMany people here have individually donated to charities and towards great causes, for genuine reasons, and that is far more valuable than those who donate for pure PR. \n\n##Back to the tree and axe saying:\n\nThe tree is Mel, old, ancient, and deeply rooted in their beliefs. While trees are beneficial, this one is rotten and is experiencing heart rot. On top of this, there are many termites planning on feasting (smaller position shorts and bears.) We are not going to eradicate them, we are going to hit them twice. They\u2019ll call the first one a fluke, contribute it to new console releases, and pure luck of WSB. \n\nBut at some point, in order to realize gains, we will have to sell. Eventually time will pass, GME will be lower than its peak values because of the inevitable squeeze, and some unfortunate souls will be FOMOing at the top and be left bag holding. These bags will be so big and heavy that not even Southwest Airlines will let them fly for free. \n\nThe likes of Mel, boomer analysts, and bears will rise again and claim that it is going back to the \u201c5 year trend.\u201d They\u2019ll be setting themselves up for a 2nd round...But by this time\n\n##TheDogFather Cohen has taken over GME \n\nand laid the foundations of successful business that will help GME transition and thrive. \n\n\nGME has consolidated and we\u2019ve kept it above $19.\nBut no one is taking us seriously. There was an obvious attack that made the Uptick Rule go into effect this week, and many expected today to be the dip. We here at WSB don\u2019t have  \ud83e\uddfb TP hands, but there are others who do. Those individuals are not aware of us and are easily manipulated. We should educate them, harden them up and have them join the cause.\n\nJust like how many of you and the public weren\u2019t aware of the memberships, many people (outside of here) aren\u2019t aware of the strategy. Or if they are, they may not understand what to do and what not to do...ie during uptick rule times and not using margins etc. \n\nWe also want to quickly spread solid info. Some of you posted my post on stock twits and noticed other people talking about it. Thank you for that, we made a reach, but we need to make it bigger. \n\nThis is where my new info and DD will come into play, and many others as well. \n\nThe reality is, many people (consumers and \u201cinvestors\u201d are still having the stereotypical view of GME. These stereotypes are leading to a downfall and an uphill battle. \n\nGetting the word out and educating people is the best thing to do, not just for GME, but for all businesses. There is great lesson to learn from and there\u2019s more to it than just \u201cthey didn\u2019t transition with the times\u201d\n\nThere are valuable lessons to learn from BlockBuster and TRU, which I will get to. \n\n##At this point I have to take a break, will update soon with the rest of the post.\n\nThere will be more information about GME, benefits, and how things work as I edit this post and add it. \n\n#I\u2019ll edit this post and update.\n\nWhy am I posting something incomplete?\n\n1) I\u2019m a human, I have to take care of somethings and come back and finish\n\n2) You\u2019re a human and you need the break. \n\n3) Gather interest in this post as reaching the hot posts takes time...unless you\u2019re the guy who posted about not spending money on awards.

This bit of info can be shared with that hospital, and they can use the certificates to purchase little toys etc. Obviously the hospital would need to use their own funds to cover the remaining balance, but perhaps they already have such budget, or maybe they can set up and we can donate here and there. \n\nAt the very least, they can get a physical copy of the magazine (assuming you signed up for $20)...but since it\u2019s COVID, the magazine can\u2019t really be shared...so maybe digital is better.\n\nThese are just random ideas, if we combine all of our low IQs, we can come up with some good benefit drive ideas etc.\n\n#TL;DR ( so far)\n\nPost is not finished (yikes)\n\nYour welcome certificate may be available now , tomorrow you should receive your 1st monthly certificate. \n\nYou may have 2 certificates tomorrow for $10 to make it rain at GME.\n\nYou can donate your rewards points to foundations.\nIf you have change / coins, take them to GME.\n\nGME now has credit card, flex pay, and layaway plans available. \n\nRead right above the TL;DR for my ideas of donations, brainstorm and let\u2019s get some good ideas rolling. \n\nEducate people and \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "author_fullname": "t2_nkled", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "\ud83d\ude80GME DD PT2 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 + Coordinated Charity for Autism and Kids + making it rain at GME + Coordinated Social Media", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_knxf4f", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 109, "total_awards_received": 6, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 109, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1609448751.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609475292.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>There are plenty of \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 to keep your attention.
