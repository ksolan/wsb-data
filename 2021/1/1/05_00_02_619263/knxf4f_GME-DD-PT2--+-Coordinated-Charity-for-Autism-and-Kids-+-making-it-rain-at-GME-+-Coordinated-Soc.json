Just like GME, most people don\u2019t understand WSB and have a negative view on us. They hear rumors, see glimpses and glorified headlines and make their opinion on WSB. \n\nAre we perfect? Hell no. Are we saints? Absolutely not. Do we have some bad apples who are cringeworthy that even we at WSB despise? Absolutely! WSB isn\u2019t for soft \u2744\ufe0f and the faint of heart individuals who take things at face value. \n\nThe truth is, just like GME, there is a lot of positives to us, but not everyone notices that and looks at both GME and WSB as pure evil. **Many are betting against GME and WSB.** Unfortunately for them, both are here to stay, and will become a greater presence as time goes on. \n\n\nHave you ever beat it up so good that months later  they contacted you back for a repeat? Well you haven\u2019t, but your wife can attest to this experience.\n\n**\u201cThe axe forgets what the tree remembers.\u201d**\n\nWe are going to hit Mel and other shorts twice. \n\nBefore I lose you since this will be a lengthy post with lofty goals of charity and coordinated social media presence...\n\nGME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\n\n\nThis is an attempt to coordinate our efforts and become a more powerful force to be reckoned with. \n\n##Speaking of Force, even Physics validates GME\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nYou see there is an equation for Newton\u2019s Law of Universal Gravitation. The law is that objects with greater masses have a greater (attraction) gravitational force. The attractive force is directly related to the mass of the objects, and inversely related to the distance between them. \n\nThe more massive the objects, the greater the force. The greater the distance, the less of the force. Want proof? Have you ever seen any chicks on my 600 lb life who is single? They all have a partner. Have you seen the 1000 lb sisters? One of them is currently pregnant. That means that someone, possibly one of you, managed to get her pregnant. \n\nThe law validates itself, the more massive you are, the more attractive you become. GME has been a massive target for shorts, it has been and will remain a huge attraction to shorts and bears. \n\nGME is so attractive, that Mel left GME for dead. They could\u2019ve closed positions, they weren\u2019t satisfied at $4. They want GME bankrupt. \n\nDon Ciccio was wise enough to order Vito to be killed when he was 9, but his foot soldiers weren\u2019t the best. In fact, when Vito\u2019s mom begged Don Ciccio to spare Vito who is \u201ddumb-witted and only 9 years old\u201d after having killed her husband and her oldest son who has vowed revenge; Don Ciccio responded \u201cwhen he becomes bigger, he will come for revenge and kill me.\u201d \n\nSo calling Mel Don Ciccio is an insult because Don Ciccio was wise to attempt to tie up loose ends, but the fate is the same. \n\nBack to Physics: The law and equation...\n\nThe equation (for Earth) is:\n\n#F = GMeM / Re^^2\n\n##Can you believe this???\n\nWe all know what Re means...but if they are scattered and too far from each other, the force is not as great. This is why we have to recruit and bring all the scattered individuals to join the cause. The closer the distance of Re, the greater the force. \n\n\n\nWith that said, not all forces are evil, and we will be benefiting many great causes. \n\nWe are the leading sub in gifting awards, by a landslide, and that\u2019s not even coordinated. Imagine if we did actually start to coordinate for our goals. \n\nFFS, **we may have set the record of most awards given to a post** for a post that said to buy shares instead of awards. \n\nPeople are aware of us....but they don\u2019t take us seriously. They notice us, they lurk for their headlines and etc, but they don\u2019t see the true power behind us. Every now and then, they may acknowledge or refer to us, but the reality is, it is always in a negative way. In fact, that\u2019s ok. We don\u2019t want to give the illusion that we do charities and donations to improve our \u201cimage.\u201d We are not like the powerful and famous people who do things for PR purposes. We are just your regular individuals who have a more giving heart then the people who look down upon us. \n\nMany people here have individually donated to charities and towards great causes, for genuine reasons, and that is far more valuable than those who donate for pure PR. \n\n##Back to the tree and axe saying:\n\nThe tree is Mel, old, ancient, and deeply rooted in their beliefs. While trees are beneficial, this one is rotten and is experiencing heart rot. On top of this, there are many termites planning on feasting (smaller position shorts and bears.) We are not going to eradicate them, we are going to hit them twice. They\u2019ll call the first one a fluke, contribute it to new console releases, and pure luck of WSB. \n\nBut at some point, in order to realize gains, we will have to sell. Eventually time will pass, GME will be lower than its peak values because of the inevitable squeeze, and some unfortunate souls will be FOMOing at the top and be left bag holding. These bags will be so big and heavy that not even Southwest Airlines will let them fly for free. \n\nThe likes of Mel, boomer analysts, and bears will rise again and claim that it is going back to the \u201c5 year trend.\u201d They\u2019ll be setting themselves up for a 2nd round...But by this time\n\n##TheDogFather Cohen has taken over GME \n\nand laid the foundations of successful business that will help GME transition and thrive. \n\n\nGME has consolidated and we\u2019ve kept it above $19.\nBut no one is taking us seriously. There was an obvious attack that made the Uptick Rule go into effect this week, and many expected today to be the dip. We here at WSB don\u2019t have  \ud83e\uddfb TP hands, but there are others who do. Those individuals are not aware of us and are easily manipulated. We should educate them, harden them up and have them join the cause.\n\nJust like how many of you and the public weren\u2019t aware of the memberships, many people (outside of here) aren\u2019t aware of the strategy. Or if they are, they may not understand what to do and what not to do...ie during uptick rule times and not using margins etc. \n\nWe also want to quickly spread solid info. Some of you posted my post on stock twits and noticed other people talking about it. Thank you for that, we made a reach, but we need to make it bigger. \n\nThis is where my new info and DD will come into play, and many others as well. \n\nThe reality is, many people (consumers and \u201cinvestors\u201d are still having the stereotypical view of GME. These stereotypes are leading to a downfall and an uphill battle. \n\nGetting the word out and educating people is the best thing to do, not just for GME, but for all businesses. There is great lesson to learn from and there\u2019s more to it than just \u201cthey didn\u2019t transition with the times\u201d\n\nThere are valuable lessons to learn from BlockBuster and TRU, which I will get to. \n\n\n#You can redeem 5k points for an additional $5 certificate or donate to the current charities GME is affiliated with. \n\nWe can also come up with our indirect donation / charity. One of my ideas was is that we can organize a program with hospitals. \n\nWe can buy memberships under fake names or possibly \n\n#Ryan Chewy\n\nThe Ryan Chewy name will serve a 2 fold purpose. Besides in the name of TheDogFather, it\u2019ll serve as a warning signal to Sherman as what is to come and that he better not start taking credit for more \u201cmemberships and retention.\u201d\n\nAnd use the phone number of a local children\u2019s hospital. This bit of info can be shared with that hospital, and they can use the certificates to purchase little toys etc. Obviously the hospital would need to use their own funds to cover the remaining balance, but perhaps they already have such budget, or maybe they can set up and we can donate here and there. \n\nAt the very least, they can get a physical copy of the magazine (assuming you signed up for $20)...but since it\u2019s COVID, the magazine can\u2019t really be shared...so maybe digital is better.\n\nThese are just random ideas, if we combine all of our low IQs, we can come up with some good benefit drive ideas etc.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n#New Update\n\n\nAlright earlier today I wrote an Erotica novel of DD, which was mainly a preface / foreplay to this. The idea was to be able to finish it all in one go, but I ran out of my supply...\n\nAll jokes aside, life came up and I thought I could finish it rather soon but that didn\u2019t happen. \n\nMany of you have an attention span that is longer than you could last in bed, so I\u2019ll just spill the DD here. I highly encourage you to go back to that post because I\u2019m trying to coordinate and a make a push for charities, donation ideas, and creating a social media push / trend to not only round up undiagnosed Autists out there, but to also to send batman signals to #TheDogFather Ryan Cohen.\n\n\nThe best \u201cnews\u201d can be slaughtered by poor presentation. I have doubts with Sherman up there, perhaps they\u2019ll use someone effective. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n#DD points: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n1) GME is making a bigger push to becoming PC oriented, not just games and accessories, but parts as well. \n\n2) The reason Sherman was able to qualify GME as \u201cessential business\u201d was because of the few PC stuff they had. Then they sold out of that PC stuff in March and after that they were basically open because of PC qualification despite not having any PC items. By switching to \u201ctechnology\u201d category, Sherman would have to qualify them into that. The way he has been able to do so is for 2 reasons. \n\nA) To ensure that they\u2019ll stay open in similar lockdowns. This will probably not be mentioned...but the dude did push for his stores to remain open and got backlash for it. Already tarnished a damaged image. \n\nB) Change business model and get in that Tech Train.\n\n\n3) OmniChannel experience. \n\n4) GME has signed contracts with \u201cabout 6\u201d vendors and providers \u201ca couple which were just recently.\u201d That number was a ball park # off the top of their mind. These include MSI, NewEgg and so on. \n\n5) You will be able to outright buy gaming PCs in stores and / or just order any part you may need. They\u2019ve ran small trials for these and plan on rolling it out to stores at different times. Unfortunately not every store will have the same experience/ products based on demographic/ size...but they should still be able to order and ship to home or store pick up. \n\n6) Stores will have dedicated areas for PC experience. Ok let\u2019s be realistic, most stores are the size a studio...so the PC area will be a house for ants. \n\nBut if you check out local GME stores and see empty display areas / locked glass with nothing in it, this is where it is probably going to be dedicated. \n\n7) Even if you buy $10 card with $5 certificate, you\u2019re not hurting GME. All those cards have been paid for before they got on the wall. You\u2019re helping money come back, plus the goal is that people will spend more money. \n\nThe goal from my 1st post with push of pro memberships wasn\u2019t to rely on the $15 or $20...and have that as the savior. \n\nThe idea is that with more memberships, you have more leads, and you have people who are more likely to buy products from you. You\u2019ve now successfully pried someone from going a bigger retailer or online merchant. \n\n8) Buy memberships for other people. You can also buy memberships for business such as daycare / hospitals etc. At the very least they can have a physical magazine delivered on a monthly basis ($20 version) even if they never choose to use certificates. \n\n9) Pro Rewards:\n#digital gamers benefit hugely. \nRemember those PSN / Steam etc cards, there is 40pts for every dollar spent on those as opposed to 20 pts on everything else.\n\nWhy does this matter? Faster points to redeem certificates for yourself or charities already affiliated with GME. \n\nEvery 5k can be redeemed for $5 certificate or donated to charities. \n\nIf you just recently signed up, you got 10K points already, plus welcome $5 coupon. Your 1st official $5 certificate will be available 1st of each month... so you may have up $20 available pretty soon...\n\n10) GME now offers their own CC, which is available to use the same day. They also offer flex pay options from 2 different vendors who allow you to qualify from your phone and make payments ...GME isn\u2019t taking this risk, they get paid from the vendors, customer pays the vendor. \n\nThey also have a rent to own program, with minimum of $120+. \n\nFinal points:\n\nMost customers are buying for other people, that isn\u2019t going to change. So while e-commerce is huge, some Karens will always need to show up to store...\n\nBut GME sells \u201cused games\u201d for nearly same price as new or more expensive than new games. They don\u2019t make this decision, they sign contracts that can\u2019t reduce price on these games until x amount of time...\n\nBut GME barely offers any $$$ for my product.\n\nHi there, they are a business, the most important thing for a business is to be in profit. \n\n##How long 1 minute is depends on which side of the bathroom door you\u2019re on...\n\nLet\u2019s talk a quick lesson of value vs worth.\n\nYour PSP might be worth $100 to you, but it only has a a value of $5 to GME. Why? Because for every 1 person that comes in looking for a PSP, they have 15 others trying to trade in. After they reach their limit of trade in, wtf are they going to do? Collect every PSP at the price you want them to? So that\u2019s part of why you get offered low prices.\n\nThere\u2019s other things involved. They have bills to pay, electricity, rent, wages, medical benefits, legal fees, alarm / security, maintenance on commercial grade AC/ventilation and many more. Oh yea, they also provide people with a safe place to trade in without risking getting robbed, shot, or killed. \n\nWhen any business closes, it\u2019s not just those employees who lose their job. The services that that business relies on (mentioned above) now lose a customer and revenue as well. There is less stores for that AC company to send people out to...which means less money for them, which leads to more lost jobs. \n\nAnd you know what caused it? That lazy bum who chose the comfort of purchasing from home from an online merchant etc. There\u2019s much more to this and this is just the tip of the iceberg when people choose how you do business and shop. There\u2019s pros and cons to everything. I\u2019m not saying never order online, but try to keep a balance. Support your local businesses when you can. \n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nICR changed to Tech because they are changing their ways, and going more PC oriented. They\u2019ve signed contracts with vendors and providers. More focus to PC gaming, include actual gaming computers, and parts that can be ordered. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\n\nDon\u2019t forget the hashtags when @RC\n\n1. #TheDogFather\n2. #AnOfferHeCantRefuse\n3. #HireOptimusPrimo\n\n#[Check this comment for correction to certificates](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/knxf4f/gme_dd_pt2_coordinated_charity_for_autism_and/gho03dg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) \n\nMakes donations easier!!!\nEducate people and \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "author_fullname": "t2_nkled", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "\ud83d\ude80GME DD PT2 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 + Coordinated Charity for Autism and Kids + making it rain at GME + Coordinated Social Media", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_knxf4f", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 128, "total_awards_received": 6, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 128, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1609468334.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609475292.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>Post updated and complete</h1>\n\n<p>There are plenty of \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 to keep your attention.

The greater the distance, the less of the force. Want proof? Have you ever seen any chicks on my 600 lb life who is single? They all have a partner. Have you seen the 1000 lb sisters? One of them is currently pregnant. That means that someone, possibly one of you, managed to get her pregnant. </p>\n\n<p>The law validates itself, the more massive you are, the more attractive you become. GME has been a massive target for shorts, it has been and will remain a huge attraction to shorts and bears. </p>\n\n<p>GME is so attractive, that Mel left GME for dead. They could\u2019ve closed positions, they weren\u2019t satisfied at $4. They want GME bankrupt. </p>\n\n<p>Don Ciccio was wise enough to order Vito to be killed when he was 9, but his foot soldiers weren\u2019t the best. In fact, when Vito\u2019s mom begged Don Ciccio to spare Vito who is \u201ddumb-witted and only 9 years old\u201d after having killed her husband and her oldest son who has vowed revenge; Don Ciccio responded \u201cwhen he becomes bigger, he will come for revenge and kill me.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>So calling Mel Don Ciccio is an insult because Don Ciccio was wise to attempt to tie up loose ends, but the fate is the same. </p>\n\n<p>Back to Physics: The law and equation...</p>\n\n<p>The equation (for Earth) is:</p>\n\n<h1>F = GMeM / Re<sup><sup>2</sup></sup></h1>\n\n<h2>Can you believe this???</h2>\n\n<p>We all know what Re means...but if they are scattered and too far from each other, the force is not as great. This is why we have to recruit and bring all the scattered individuals to join the cause. The closer the distance of Re, the greater the force. </p>\n\n<p>With that said, not all forces are evil, and we will be benefiting many great causes. </p>\n\n<p>We are the leading sub in gifting awards, by a landslide, and that\u2019s not even coordinated. Imagine if we did actually start to coordinate for our goals. </p>\n\n<p>FFS, <strong>we may have set the record of most awards given to a post</strong> for a post that said to buy shares instead of awards. </p>\n\n<p>People are aware of us....but they don\u2019t take us seriously. They notice us, they lurk for their headlines and etc, but they don\u2019t see the true power behind us. Every now and then, they may acknowledge or refer to us, but the reality is, it is always in a negative way. In fact, that\u2019s ok. We don\u2019t want to give the illusion that we do charities and donations to improve our \u201cimage.\u201d We are not like the powerful and famous people who do things for PR purposes. We are just your regular individuals who have a more giving heart then the people who look down upon us. </p>\n\n<p>Many people here have individually donated to charities and towards great causes, for genuine reasons, and that is far more valuable than those who donate for pure PR. </p>\n\n<h2>Back to the tree and axe saying:</h2>\n\n<p>The tree is Mel, old, ancient, and deeply rooted in their beliefs. While trees are beneficial, this one is rotten and is experiencing heart rot. On top of this, there are many termites planning on feasting (smaller position shorts and bears.) We are not going to eradicate them, we are going to hit them twice. They\u2019ll call the first one a fluke, contribute it to new console releases, and pure luck of WSB. </p>\n\n<p>But at some point, in order to realize gains, we will have to sell. Eventually time will pass, GME will be lower than its peak values because of the inevitable squeeze, and some unfortunate souls will be FOMOing at the top and be left bag holding. These bags will be so big and heavy that not even Southwest Airlines will let them fly for free. </p>\n\n<p>The likes of Mel, boomer analysts, and bears will rise again and claim that it is going back to the \u201c5 year trend.\u201d They\u2019ll be setting themselves up for a 2nd round...But by this time</p>\n\n<h2>TheDogFather Cohen has taken over GME</h2>\n\n<p>and laid the foundations of successful business that will help GME transition and thrive. </p>\n\n<p>GME has consolidated and we\u2019ve kept it above $19.\nBut no one is taking us seriously. There was an obvious attack that made the Uptick Rule go into effect this week, and many expected today to be the dip. We here at WSB don\u2019t have  \ud83e\uddfb TP hands, but there are others who do. Those individuals are not aware of us and are easily manipulated. We should educate them, harden them up and have them join the cause.</p>\n\n<p>Just like how many of you and the public weren\u2019t aware of the memberships, many people (outside of here) aren\u2019t aware of the strategy. Or if they are, they may not understand what to do and what not to do...ie during uptick rule times and not using margins etc. </p>\n\n<p>We also want to quickly spread solid info. Some of you posted my post on stock twits and noticed other people talking about it. Thank you for that, we made a reach, but we need to make it bigger. </p>\n\n<p>This is where my new info and DD will come into play, and many others as well. </p>\n\n<p>The reality is, many people (consumers and \u201cinvestors\u201d are still having the stereotypical view of GME. These stereotypes are leading to a downfall and an uphill battle. </p>\n\n<p>Getting the word out and educating people is the best thing to do, not just for GME, but for all businesses. There is great lesson to learn from and there\u2019s more to it than just \u201cthey didn\u2019t transition with the times\u201d</p>\n\n<p>There are valuable lessons to learn from BlockBuster and TRU, which I will get to. </p>\n\n<h1>You can redeem 5k points for an additional $5 certificate or donate to the current charities GME is affiliated with.</h1>\n\n<p>We can also come up with our indirect donation / charity. One of my ideas was is that we can organize a program with hospitals. </p>\n\n<p>We can buy memberships under fake names or possibly </p>\n\n<h1>Ryan Chewy</h1>\n\n<p>The Ryan Chewy name will serve a 2 fold purpose. Besides in the name of TheDogFather, it\u2019ll serve as a warning signal to Sherman as what is to come and that he better not start taking credit for more \u201cmemberships and retention.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And use the phone number of a local children\u2019s hospital. This bit of info can be shared with that hospital, and they can use the certificates to purchase little toys etc. Obviously the hospital would need to use their own funds to cover the remaining balance, but perhaps they already have such budget, or maybe they can set up and we can donate here and there. </p>\n\n<p>At the very least, they can get a physical copy of the magazine (assuming you signed up for $20)...but since it\u2019s COVID, the magazine can\u2019t really be shared...so maybe digital is better.</p>\n\n<p>These are just random ideas, if we combine all of our low IQs, we can come up with some good benefit drive ideas etc.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p>\n\n<h1>New Update</h1>\n\n<p>Alright earlier today I wrote an Erotica novel of DD, which was mainly a preface / foreplay to this. The idea was to be able to finish it all in one go, but I ran out of my supply...</p>\n\n<p>All jokes aside, life came up and I thought I could finish it rather soon but that didn\u2019t happen. </p>\n\n<p>Many of you have an attention span that is longer than you could last in bed, so I\u2019ll just spill the DD here. I highly encourage you to go back to that post because I\u2019m trying to coordinate and a make a push for charities, donation ideas, and creating a social media push / trend to not only round up undiagnosed Autists out there, but to also to send batman signals to #TheDogFather Ryan Cohen.</p>\n\n<p>The best \u201cnews\u201d can be slaughtered by poor presentation. I have doubts with Sherman up there, perhaps they\u2019ll use someone effective. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f</p>\n\n<h1>DD points: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80</h1>\n\n<p>1) GME is making a bigger push to becoming PC oriented, not just games and accessories, but parts as well. </p>\n\n<p>2) The reason Sherman was able to qualify GME as \u201cessential business\u201d was because of the few PC stuff they had. Then they sold out of that PC stuff in March and after that they were basically open because of PC qualification despite not having any PC items. By switching to \u201ctechnology\u201d category, Sherman would have to qualify them into that. The way he has been able to do so is for 2 reasons. </p>\n\n<p>A) To ensure that they\u2019ll stay open in similar lockdowns. This will probably not be mentioned...but the dude did push for his stores to remain open and got backlash for it. Already tarnished a damaged image. </p>\n\n<p>B) Change business model and get in that Tech Train.</p>\n\n<p>3) OmniChannel experience. </p>\n\n<p>4) GME has signed contracts with \u201cabout 6\u201d vendors and providers \u201ca couple which were just recently.\u201d That number was a ball park # off the top of their mind. These include MSI, NewEgg and so on. </p>\n\n<p>5) You will be able to outright buy gaming PCs in stores and / or just order any part you may need. They\u2019ve ran small trials for these and plan on rolling it out to stores at different times. Unfortunately not every store will have the same experience/ products based on demographic/ size...but they should still be able to order and ship to home or store pick up. </p>\n\n<p>6) Stores will have dedicated areas for PC experience. Ok let\u2019s be realistic, most stores are the size a studio...so the PC area will be a house for ants. </p>\n\n<p>But if you check out local GME stores and see empty display areas / locked glass with nothing in it, this is where it is probably going to be dedicated. </p>\n\n<p>7) Even if you buy $10 card with $5 certificate, you\u2019re not hurting GME. All those cards have been paid for before they got on the wall. You\u2019re helping money come back, plus the goal is that people will spend more money. </p>\n\n<p>The goal from my 1st post with push of pro memberships wasn\u2019t to rely on the $15 or $20...and have that as the savior. </p>\n\n<p>The idea is that with more memberships, you have more leads, and you have people who are more likely to buy products from you. You\u2019ve now successfully pried someone from going a bigger retailer or online merchant. </p>\n\n<p>8) Buy memberships for other people. You can also buy memberships for business such as daycare / hospitals etc. At the very least they can have a physical magazine delivered on a monthly basis ($20 version) even if they never choose to use certificates. </p>\n\n<p>9) Pro Rewards:</p>\n\n<h1>digital gamers benefit hugely.</h1>\n\n<p>Remember those PSN / Steam etc cards, there is 40pts for every dollar spent on those as opposed to 20 pts on everything else.</p>\n\n<p>Why does this matter? Faster points to redeem certificates for yourself or charities already affiliated with GME. </p>\n\n<p>Every 5k can be redeemed for $5 certificate or donated to charities. </p>\n\n<p>If you just recently signed up, you got 10K points already, plus welcome $5 coupon. Your 1st official $5 certificate will be available 1st of each month... so you may have up $20 available pretty soon...</p>\n\n<p>10) GME now offers their own CC, which is available to use the same day. They also offer flex pay options from 2 different vendors who allow you to qualify from your phone and make payments ...GME isn\u2019t taking this risk, they get paid from the vendors, customer pays the vendor. </p>\n\n<p>They also have a rent to own program, with minimum of $120+. </p>\n\n<p>Final points:</p>\n\n<p>Most customers are buying for other people, that isn\u2019t going to change. So while e-commerce is huge, some Karens will always need to show up to store...</p>\n\n<p>But GME sells \u201cused games\u201d for nearly same price as new or more expensive than new games. They don\u2019t make this decision, they sign contracts that can\u2019t reduce price on these games until x amount of time...</p>\n\n<p>But GME barely offers any $$$ for my product.</p>\n\n<p>Hi there, they are a business, the most important thing for a business is to be in profit. </p>\n\n<h2>How long 1 minute is depends on which side of the bathroom door you\u2019re on...</h2>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s talk a quick lesson of value vs worth.</p>\n\n<p>Your PSP might be worth $100 to you, but it only has a a value of $5 to GME. Why? Because for every 1 person that comes in looking for a PSP, they have 15 others trying to trade in. After they reach their limit of trade in, wtf are they going to do? Collect every PSP at the price you want them to? So that\u2019s part of why you get offered low prices.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s other things involved. They have bills to pay, electricity, rent, wages, medical benefits, legal fees, alarm / security, maintenance on commercial grade AC/ventilation and many more. Oh yea, they also provide people with a safe place to trade in without risking getting robbed, shot, or killed. </p>\n\n<p>When any business closes, it\u2019s not just those employees who lose their job. The services that that business relies on (mentioned above) now lose a customer and revenue as well. There is less stores for that AC company to send people out to...which means less money for them, which leads to more lost jobs. </p>\n\n<p>And you know what caused it? That lazy bum who chose the comfort of purchasing from home from an online merchant etc. There\u2019s much more to this and this is just the tip of the iceberg when people choose how you do business and shop. There\u2019s pros and cons to everything. I\u2019m not saying never order online, but try to keep a balance. Support your local businesses when you can. </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR:</p>\n\n<p>ICR changed to Tech because they are changing their ways, and going more PC oriented. They\u2019ve signed contracts with vendors and providers. More focus to PC gaming, include actual gaming computers, and parts that can be ordered.
