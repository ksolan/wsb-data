I have doubts with Sherman up there, perhaps they\u2019ll use someone effective. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n#DD points: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n1) GME is making a bigger push to becoming PC oriented, not just games and accessories, but parts as well. \n\n2) The reason Sherman was able to qualify GME as \u201cessential business\u201d was because of the few PC stuff they had. Then they sold out of that PC stuff in March and after that they were basically open because of PC qualification despite not having any PC items. By switching to \u201ctechnology\u201d category, Sherman would have to qualify them into that. The way he has been able to do so is for 2 reasons. \n\nA) To ensure that they\u2019ll stay open in similar lockdowns. This will probably not be mentioned...but the dude did push for his stores to remain open and got backlash for it. Already tarnished a damaged image. \n\nB) Change business model and get in that Tech Train.\n\n\n3) OmniChannel experience. \n\n4) GME has signed contracts with \u201cabout 6\u201d vendors and providers \u201ca couple which were just recently.\u201d That number was a ball park # off the top of their mind. These include MSI, NewEgg and so on. \n\n5) You will be able to outright buy gaming PCs in stores and / or just order any part you may need. They\u2019ve ran small trials for these and plan on rolling it out to stores at different times. Unfortunately not every store will have the same experience/ products based on demographic/ size...but they should still be able to order and ship to home or store pick up. \n\n6) Stores will have dedicated areas for PC experience. Ok let\u2019s be realistic, most stores are the size a studio...so the PC area will be a house for ants. \n\nBut if you check out local GME stores and see empty display areas / locked glass with nothing in it, this is where it is probably going to be dedicated. \n\n7) Even if you buy $10 card with $5 certificate, you\u2019re not hurting GME. All those cards have been paid for before they got on the wall. You\u2019re helping money come back, plus the goal is that people will spend more money. \n\nThe goal from my 1st post with push of pro memberships wasn\u2019t to rely on the $15 or $20...and have that as the savior. \n\nThe idea is that with more memberships, you have more leads, and you have people who are more likely to buy products from you. You\u2019ve now successfully pried someone from going a bigger retailer or online merchant. \n\n8) Buy memberships for other people. You can also buy memberships for business such as daycare / hospitals etc. At the very least they can have a physical magazine delivered on a monthly basis ($20 version) even if they never choose to use certificates. \n\n9) Pro Rewards:\n#digital gamers benefit hugely. \nRemember those PSN / Steam etc cards, there is 40pts for every dollar spent on those as opposed to 20 pts on everything else.\n\nWhy does this matter? Faster points to redeem certificates for yourself or charities already affiliated with GME. \n\nEvery 5k can be redeemed for $5 certificate or donated to charities. \n\nIf you just recently signed up, you got 10K points already, plus welcome $5 coupon. Your 1st official $5 certificate will be available 1st of each month... so you may have up $20 available pretty soon...\n\n10) GME now offers their own CC, which is available to use the same day. They also offer flex pay options from 2 different vendors who allow you to qualify from your phone and make payments ...GME isn\u2019t taking this risk, they get paid from the vendors, customer pays the vendor. \n\nThey also have a rent to own program, with minimum of $120+. \n\nFinal points:\n\nMost customers are buying for other people, that isn\u2019t going to change. So while e-commerce is huge, some Karens will always need to show up to store...\n\nBut GME sells \u201cused games\u201d for nearly same price as new or more expensive than new games. They don\u2019t make this decision, they sign contracts that can\u2019t reduce price on these games until x amount of time...\n\nBut GME barely offers any $$$ for my product.\n\nHi there, they are a business, the most important thing for a business after customer service is to have profit margins.\n\n##How long 1 minute is depends on which side of the bathroom door you\u2019re on...\n\nLet\u2019s talk a quick lesson of value vs worth.\n\nYour PSP might be worth $100 to you, but it only has a a value of $5 to GME. Why? Because for every 1 person that comes in looking for a PSP, they have 15 others trying to trade in. After they reach their limit of trade in, wtf are they going to do? Collect every PSP at the price you want them to? So that\u2019s part of why you get offered low prices.\n\nThere\u2019s other things involved. They have bills to pay, electricity, rent, wages, medical benefits, legal fees, alarm / security, maintenance on commercial grade AC/ventilation and many more. Oh yea, they also provide people with a safe place to trade in without risking getting robbed, shot, or killed. \n\nWhen any business closes, it\u2019s not just those employees who lose their job. The services that that business relies on (mentioned above) now lose a customer and revenue as well. There is less stores for that AC company to send people out to...which means less money for them, which leads to more lost jobs. \n\nAnd you know what caused it? That lazy bum who chose the comfort of purchasing from home from an online merchant etc. There\u2019s much more to this and this is just the tip of the iceberg when people choose how you do business and shop. There\u2019s pros and cons to everything. I\u2019m not saying never order online, but try to keep a balance. Support your local businesses when you can. \n\n\n#TL;DR:\n\nICR changed to Tech because they are changing their ways, and going more PC oriented. They\u2019ve signed contracts with vendors and providers.
