{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I got two goals here. One is for you to understand what Salesforce and SAP really do instead of just \"cloud\" and \"software\" and why Salesforce will become like SAP. The second is to tell you what to expect with CRM price and how to make tendies.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst you gotta understand what exactly SAP does and what happened with their stock. SAP is one of the largest software companies which focus on ERP. What the fuck is ERP you might ask? ERP is what other businesses use to track business resources. This ranges from everything such as planning and optimizing manufacturing capacity to dealing with payroll for employees. Basically companies don't want to create their own software for handling these wide range of tasks and pay SAP a shit load of money to do it for them. Where's the problem you might ask? Unless you are involved with one of these companies that use SAP, it's difficult to understand what the experience is like. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd\n\nBasically a company pays SAP to use their software for dealing with one of these areas of ERP. This generally works fine since SAP has used their business management software with a lot of companies for the same tasks. The issue is when one of these companies want to [customize the software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning#Disadvantages) to meet unique demands for the company. This re-engineering process to fit the ERP system for many tasks ends up costing more for a company and wasting a lot of time and money. Interestingly enough, you can ask almost any business about their experience with SAP and they will all say that they're unhappy even though they use their software. So what you might ask, wouldn't SAP still be generating tons of revenue? Well yes but more of these companies are moving away from this way of doing ERP as it is an inflexible approach. This is becoming replaced by more loosely connected systems utilizing cloud instead of having a one solves all solution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20\n\nLet's look at how their financial earnings and stock price have reflected this. In the past two years this stock has traded relatively sideways with some really bad drops. Around May to August their stock price went up 60% do to the hype around cloud companies benefiting from COVID. However it has obviously taken a really bad fall when October earnings were announced. They claimed that there was slower recovery than anticipated for many of its clients. However I suspect that many of these companies have been looking to shift away from SAP as the pandemic has shown the importance of the flexibility of these systems. By looking at their past quarters, you can see that their quarterly revenue has been flat around the 8 billion range and the company is clearly having a difficult time changing their business model. Other cloud companies are replacing their solutions as SAP's clients move away from their software even though SAP is trying to shift to [modern cloud technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP#Corporate_restructuring). Generally though companies have a hard time changing their business approach from the old way of doing things to the new way of doing things. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow the important part. What the fuck does SAP's troubles have to do with Salesforce. As you may have guessed from the ticker Salesforce provides CRM or customer relationship management. [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) is a specific area in ERP dealing with customer services. For example a company may want a software for their call center or to automate a marketing effort. Salesforce provides software to do this along with analytics of this data so that these businesses can make informed decisions.\n\nAs you may have already guessed Salesforce is facing some similar problems that SAP deal with. When a company decides to expand their CRM software to deal with more parts of their business, the inflexibility and costs quickly become apparent. [For example, many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial basis and less than 40 percent of companies have high end-user adoption rates.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management#Criticism) Again if you are not familiar with software development and companies using these software vendors it is difficult to fully understand these troubles. I would strongly recommend researching the issues of customizing ERP or CRM software for a specific company if you are not convinced. While Salesforce tries to provide an all in one solution for their clients, customization becomes complicated and prices become costly. These customizations become difficult to do and take a lot of time, planning, and money. Companies are becoming more inclined to take a different approach for building these systems. In a lot of these cases it is easier for a business to build their own system in the cloud using products from companies such as Microsoft or Amazon for more customizability. \n\nAnother big issue is the concern over customer data with CRM systems. A company might opt to develop their own CRM systems where they can ensure that customer data is obeying customer privacy laws and allows them to have more control over private data. This can help build a better relationship with the customer. Privacy issues over customer data has obviously become a big issue in 2020.\n\nFurthermore, Salesforce has been trying to get into more areas with [recent acquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce). Similar to SAP, I suspect that Salesforce will crush over their own weight as they try to expand their company. One good example of this is their recent acquisition of Slack. Slack does not really fit any of Salesforce ecosystem and is really just an attempt to expand into a different area. Slack has a lot of competition from Microsoft teams and other companies which can do what Slack does but better. \n\nBusiness will start to move away from Salesforce similar to SAP. This is not to say that they be completely independent as Salesforce does make some parts of the businesses easier. However there seems to be a strong resemblance to SAP based on what I know from inside of a corporation using both SAP and Salesforce and the many issues they face when they try and customize their solutions.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo how can we use this information to print tendies? The expectation is that Salesforce will eventually slow their growth down while stock is overhyped due to being a cloud company and start to fall or go sideways like SAP. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=4282ffef17bd83b9a62a7f196974d0113511b1d5\n\nBasically the idea is to try and play puts, especially around earnings. If Salesforce misses their guidance then the stock could be in a serious reversal especially for a cloud company with a lot of hype. The next earnings will be early March.\n\nYou can also try and play longer term puts but the stock is fairly volatile like SAP and I would only do this if you see the price go up significantly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr; buy puts in march \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: long on GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "author_fullname": "t2_by40i", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Why Salesforce ($CRM) is going to be the next SAP", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"vl629rb14p861": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=763097feeba7ac282d2d8f087389113ff12c631c"}, {"y": 120, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=35e537a619d95e4e1f23710642435e91c3ea0fb6"}, {"y": 177, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=2a489a0195c64a840db1719d0b6b8d5800021024"}, {"y": 355, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c8ee13422ab2ff8b33b56cee5640deb2e4d1b0d2"}], "s": {"y": 515, "x": 927, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=4282ffef17bd83b9a62a7f196974d0113511b1d5"}, "id": "vl629rb14p861"}, "htsfvr8uro861": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d7249150f885c6c0ee1283d98ef9dcf592663302"}, {"y": 162, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=90452679d02ec5a8278a9ae205ac1a90dc9e5333"}, {"y": 241, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c8a097aac67f6bf555c12b9f080b218e9c82507f"}], "s": {"y": 377, "x": 500, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd"}, "id": "htsfvr8uro861"}, "ugj07ez0to861": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 55, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=bee078b83cf19a60400062a97e2bec8a100bcca0"}, {"y": 111, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b9d4ace6beb48cc0950431aca17920eee28350e2"}, {"y": 165, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=52050f598ee622c54a0f18b5399f45d3c2adb620"}, {"y": 331, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ed3812f8b08cbbb60a5cc57c70444e1e785c3e10"}, {"y": 497, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=35d20dbdb56e5616c98c74b8c4e2f0d672079df0"}], "s": {"y": 510, "x": 984, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20"}, "id": "ugj07ez0to861"}}, "name": "t3_ko9bta", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/NVk8aJHcee5_r4OaXoxQysDJRrkfD-pA8ayYH-pAlGw.jpg", "edited": 1609498362.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609526605.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I got two goals here.
