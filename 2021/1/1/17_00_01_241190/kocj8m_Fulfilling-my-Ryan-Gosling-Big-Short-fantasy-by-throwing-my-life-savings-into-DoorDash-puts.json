Looking at the level 2 data, there is almost no retail volume, and any trades made throughout the day are by MMs trying to keep this stock liquid. Volume from the past 2 days has already dropped by 50%. Literally NO ONE wants to buy this POS. The price is pinned at $140, with retail dips that are immediately bought up by manipulation. If you look at the 1 minute chart yesterday, it traded at literally $140 throughout the day and suddenly spiked to 146 in a manner of 3 minutes before slowly settling down to $142.

While it does command 50% of the food delivery market, it made a measly $1.9B revenue through September 2020 with $149M in losses ([DoorDash releases S-1 for IPO, reports $149M in losses through September (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/doordash-releases-s-1-for-ipo.html)) during COVID lockdowns across the nation, when it is literally the best possible conditions for food delivery. As vaccinations and anti-maskers start going out again, revenue will only decrease. There is also no brand loyalty, and no advantage over is competitors such as UberEats, Postmates, Grubhub, Waitr, Seamless, Munchery, Instacart, the pizza delivery guy fucking your wife, etc.\n\nI have 175 contracts of 5/21 $80 puts.

More than likely, I'll probably have to start driving for DoorDash and moonlight sucking weens behind the restaurants I just made a delivery from.\n\nLooking for any serious counterarguments on why this play might be retarded.
