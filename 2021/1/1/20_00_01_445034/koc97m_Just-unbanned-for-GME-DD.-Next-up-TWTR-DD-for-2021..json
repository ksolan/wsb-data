{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I am writing this Twitter DD on 12/28/20 while currently banned for posting a rumor that I made up that Gamestop would be delivering vaccines.   \n\nOnto the Twitter DD.  \n\nPoint 1: Look at TWTR just by the numbers. The market cap is $43B as compared to Snap at $73B. Twitter has 330 million monthly active users and 187 million daily actives. Snap has something like 101 million daily active users. Snap has 1.72B in revenue in 2019. Twitter had 3.5B in revenue in 2019. The maths dont add up.   \n\nMore recently, Q3 2020 was $775M for Twitter and $679M, Q3 2020.  Snap is growing faster so the higher multiple may be justified from that perspective. But what if Twitter came up with a new revenue stream? If you are still reading, might as well read a little more. It's not like I am going to start a rumor that Gamestop is going to deliver the coronavirus vaccine despite this map showing how easily half the United States could both get coronavirus-free and a new PS5 while waiting https://bit.ly/2WSQvq8. I digress...\n\nPoint 2: Twitter announced in July that they are going to work on a paid version ala OnlyFans (https://cnn.it/34L1VRl). If they actually introduce that this year, this should be a similar moment to Disney killing it on digital subscribers (which I made 1000% and $100k on https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jqytzu/mickey_mouse_mega_gains_mickey_mousa_usa_usa_1500/) or Facebook adding local stores or whatever they did this year. The question is WHEN will Twitter introduce it. If you are hiring in July would you beta something 6 months out? 9 months out? 12 months? That's for your call options to decide.   \n\nPoint 3: Twitter has the worst career pages of all tech companies. But if you are willing to suffer through the shitty animations, the worst search you have ever used, and forced diversity showcasing imagery, then you might notice that recent Engineering posts like the one in this screenshot https://imgur.com/a/D85SNsM (post here: https://bit.ly/37QZnD3) hold a curious couple lines around payments. Specifically:  \"We\u2019re on a mission to build the foundation of a strong payment platform to enable a multi-fold growth of Twitter\u2019s revenue.\" and \"Enable payments functionality for advertisers, and in ****not-so-distant future****, for other Twitter revenue streams.\"   \n   \nNow again, it's up to you to decide what \"not-so-distant\" means. To me, that means 1-2 quarters maximum. To a shitty company, that could mean 1-2 years or it might never happen. My opinion is that now that Jack Dorsey announced that Twitter employees can \"work from home forever\" they might actually be motivated to build some shit that makes more money.
