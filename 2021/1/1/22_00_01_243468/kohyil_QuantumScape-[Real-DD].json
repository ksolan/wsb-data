{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**VW**\n\n* **How did get tied up with QS?**\n   * The VW CEO Martin Winterkorn son (also named Martin) works/worked for one of the QS Founder (Prof Prinz) at Stanford.\n   * [http://npl-archive.stanford.edu/people/?m=134](http://npl-archive.stanford.edu/people/?m=134)\n   * [http://npl-archive.stanford.edu/people/](http://npl-archive.stanford.edu/people/)\n   * CEO Winterkorn resigned from VW (Dielgate) in  2015, but VW completed their first investment in QS in 2014 (and had a 'relationship' with QS since 2012 (according to the recent QS presentation))\n* **Guess**: VW \"diesel-gate\" caused VW to bet bigger on clean-tech like QS, since they were already down the plan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tech**\n\n* **Prototype cell**:  Single-layer and 30 x 30 mm (1.1811 inch x 1.1811 inch)\n   * The small size, which is quite far away from a commercial size cell makes be doubt if the results will scale to commercial size cells.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Lack of Energy Density Data**:  This is usually measured in Watt-hour/weight or Watt-hour/volume (Wh/kg or Wh/L).  QS shows a graph with their energy density at 1,000 Wh/L, but it wasn't backed up with any data, so it just looked like a goal.\n   * Another point is that, when you have a 'solid' battery like QS, with no liquid electrolyte, you need  some additional materials to create the ionic conductivity between the anode and cathode (an anolyte and catholyte). No liquid electrolyte is good, since it reduces the \"explosivity\" of the battery.  But some in the industry think that, the need for an anolyte and catholyte, will cause the battery to have a lower energy density, and therefore not make economical sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Solid State Separator (SSS**):  QS's main technical achievement is in the SSS, which separates the anode from the cathode.  Why hasn't anyone developed a good SSS yet?\n   * **Perfect surface:**  The SSS needs to have perfect surface qualities.  If not, dendrites grow, and end up breaking through the SSS, and shorting out the anode and cathode (think of sticking a 2-prong fork into your electric outlet).\n      * **Manufacturing Costs**: To create these perfect surfaces, requires technology more similar to semiconductor manufacturing than battery manufacturing equipment.  Semicon equipment is very expensive and doesn't have high-throughput (yes, when you're selling a < 0.5\" square chip for $100+, it makes sense, but when you scale up to battery sizes, it doesn't make economical sense).\n      * **Thin**: In order to keep energy density high the SSS needs to be thin, but the thinner it gets, the less strong it is.\n      * **Fragile**: These thin and perfect SSS's are somewhat fragile, so in order to not degrade over the 100k mile life in a car, the battery pack needs to have more cushioning and other structures to make sure the SSS doesn't crack.\n      * **High Temperatures**:  SSS's conduct electricity best when they are warm 30C+.  This is why the main QS results are done at 30C and 45C.  Yes, QS shows some data at lower temperatures, but if QS's SSS worked well at lower temps, why weren't all the results shown at room temp (20F or 68F)?\n      * Also needing equipment to warm up your batteries, takes up more battery-pack volume, therefore decreases the energy-density, and increase cost and complexity.\n\nThank you for listening to my TED talk! I'm not a battery engineering, but I have been reading up a lot about batteries since the announcement of the SPAC and I hope you found this useful, please let me know if I have some wrong assumptions/ideas here.\n\n  \nEdit: As many are pointing out, the valuation is crazy high also, but I didn't want to go into that, since many others have already.
