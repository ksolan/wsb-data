{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Dear beloved GME gang, some of you might have read my bull erotica and although I'm not as chad as some of our dearest OG gme bulls, I'm afraid I turned bearish for the next few weeks. Here are a few reasons as to why\n\n1. Everyone expect positive news coming from the ICR conference, however, given that management has failed to excite shareholders in the past, we really shouldn't expect anything different. Someone else posted that RC is not expected to attend the conference so I wouldn't expect anything spectacular. Sherman and gang will probably repeat the same thing they said during the last earning call.\n2. We are also expecting console sales to come out this week, as  Uberkikz pointed out in his models, sales are likely not as strong as they should due to the ongoing shortage. Spoke with some random GME employee today and it sounds like shortages will continue until spring at the very least. This will hopefully just delay profits to later quarters\n3. MM /Dealer option hedging flows. This is IMO the most important reason as to why GME will dump. The below is a combination of tidbits of things I learned over time so take it with a grain of salt, but know this.:[https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original\\_271543791.png](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_271543791.png)yes I know it's from stocktwits, but this tells us something very important actually. Look at the overall put open interest. GME has a put/call ratio of 2.78,  total puts numbering at 19.359 million.  I've yet to see confirmed reports of exactly how much shares hedge funds like melvin capital actually shorted but I think the answer isn't as much as you think. Yes, they have bearish positions but they are executing on that with put options, meaning the actual short holders are the market makers themselves. (MM short shares as hedge based on delta of the puts they sold to these hedgefunds). If this is true this is gonna really fuck with our short squeeze thesis because MM has pretty deep pockets and they're not likely to be squeezed as they have  a huge margin, any expenses/loss they incur can be compensated for by selling high IV options, and quoting high bid-ask spreads on both options AND shares when transacting. I've been noticing that bid-ask spreads decrease substantially when we pump up into strikes with heavy put option interest and increase when we dump below those put strikes. Longs are getting double fucked by heavy put buying.\n4. Looking at point #3 but in more detail, the options positioning for next week looks bearish af. On the call side we have pretty much all YOLO 30c bought at \\~150% IV  + a bunch of other OTM calls. but on the PUT side we have concentrated 24P with OI of 51k, no doubt from our enemies at Melvin Capital. There is no question that all options are going to get IV crushed, the problem is that\n   1. OTM call getting IV crushed will lead to a dump due to MM selling the shares the bought for hedging (decreased IV on OTM calls = decreased delta hedging = dump)\n   2. ITM Puts getting \"IV crushed\" will lead to a dump due to MM shorting more shares (decreased IV on ITM calls = INCREASED delta hedging with short  = dump)\n\nSo yea, we gonna dump. Now before you retards go screaming to SEC about market manipulation, just know that we do this on a daily basis but with call options, driving shit up every day and getting stupid meme returns. This will be a long drawn out battle, and I suspect the GME squeeze might take much longer than anyone expect. Management will have to prove over time (hopefully soon) that they can turn the business around and generate consistent free cash flow, then one day be able to receive credit upgrades and reinstate dividends.  I hate boomer shit like dividends but it is my belief that dividends will actually cause a pump and short covering rally for the stock, because shorts are responsible for paying dividends.  If you look at historic short interest for GME, it pretty much went vertical when GME announced dividend suspension (check it on ortex around april - july 2019)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I think I wrote a bear erotica, but GME gang needs to understand this and if you're not ready for the long run you should GTFO. I REALLY HOPE I'M WRONG for next week. I really hope management can announce something exciting next week but the writing is on the wall for me. So I am making the following trades.\n\n1. taking profit on my april 20c\n2. Keeping my shares (small measley 500shares) but I'll be waiting for a pump on monday then sell ITM covered calls, then BUY ATM puts EOD monday.\n3. As someone else pointed out, there's a gap down from 16ish - 14ish. I'll be selling puts at the $13 range in the hopes that I'll be assigned those shares.\n\ngodspeed retards\n\nUpdate: You're free to keep your bull positions,  like I said, I could be wrong and I hope I'm wrong. In fact, if  you buy enough OTM (or ITM depending on IV) calls and pump us past 24 we'd probably start a huge rally.  But if you have shares you should probably hedge. If you got profit, nows the time to take some and re-enter at a lower price.
