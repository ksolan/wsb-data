{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Okay listen up autists. I have seen a lot doom and gloom about GME lately, speculation about poor holiday sales, complaints about the short squeeze not happening, shortages in supply for the new consoles and even some \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b treading out in the open. So let me clarify to you retards some ignored reasons why GME is going to the moon \ud83c\udf1a \n\nLet's start out with a common misconception which I have seen debunked a few times but still seems to linger. It seems that a lot of you retards just look at the chart of the stock price and think that Gamestops all time high was in the low 60-ies or high 50-ies. WRONG. Ok technically, this is true, but it is not important. The all time high for Gamestop stock was 63 dollars per share back in 2007. The problem is that Gamestop had a lot more shares back then. The all time high for the market cap of Gamestop is $9.86 billion. *The current market cap is $1.15 billion.* That means that if Gamestop grew just to the same size it was before with RCs new vision for the company, the stock would increase **8.6 times to $150(\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80).** \n\nNot only is the all time high probably a lot higher than some of you thought, the market for gaming has grown significantly since then and it is still growing. The gaming market has increased 2.5 times in size since 2007 and keeps growing each year. Gamestop is also shifting its business from just selling games to selling very high margin items like collectibles, PC parts and gaming equipment and signing deals for online sales with Microsoft. Additionally, e-commerce companies, especially ones in large and growing industries, are generally valued a lot higher than brick and mortar shops. That means that reaching the same size as old Gamestop did might entail a greater stock price.\n\nOk so we have established that there is a lot of potential for GME stock and for some of you autists that's enough to throw your life savings into it. But I can already see my future DMs filled with [\ud83c\udf08](https://emojipedia.org/rainbow/)\ud83d\udc3b saying that the potential doesn't matter because gAmEsToP iS tHe NeW bLoCkBuStEr and they are going to either go bankrupt or get smaller and smaller over time until they aren't relevant anymore. So lets make clear what the vision for Gamestop's future is. By which I mean what certified genius Ryan Cohen wants for its future. Cohen's vision can be summarized as a transition from a brick and mortar shop to an e-commerce giant competing with Amazon. He is famously obsessed with customer service and wants to make Gamestop the 1 stop for all things gaming. Imagine a slick website where you can buy everything related to gaming: gaming PC parts, gaming collectibles, etc. Add in 24/7 customer service provided by people knowledgeable about the products Gamestop will be selling. As well as fast shipping with a whopping $0 delivery fee because there are thousands of Gamestops all over the US where you can pick up your order. All these things were hallmarks Cohens previous company and in articles like [this one](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/?sh=655bf7165579) where he talks excessively about the importance of providing those features in an e-commerce environment. \n\nTo finish off I would like to show you just how dedicated Cohen seems to be to making Gamestop an e-commerce giant. The article I linked above is from January 2020, about 6 months before Cohen made his first investment into Gamestop and is titled \u201cRyan Cohen Started A Company That Took On Amazon, And Sold It For $3 Billion. Now He\u2019s Thinking About What\u2019s Next\u201d. In the article Cohen says that he is still looking for ways to compete with Amazon and that he thinks they have \u201cChinks in their armor\u201d that he seems to want to expose. What I found the most interesting though was the following excerpt: \n\n>*right now he is trying to figure out what the next \u201csomething\u201d will be for him. \u201cI look at almost everything that comes to me, but I say no to 99.9% of it. \\[...\\] As Warren Buffet says, the difference between successful and really successful people is really successful people say no all the time.\u201d.*\n\n That means that after more than 2 years of searching and looking at different opportunities he decided that Gamestop was the basket he wanted to put all his eggs in. In another article he said \u201cI relished the challenges of disrupting an entire industry and trying to delight customers to a degree that had never been achieved before.\u201d and he has also said in yet another article when asked about the opportunities he sees for himself in the future \"I've been an entrepreneur since my early teens and certainly haven't peaked at age 34!\" \n\nSo genius Ryan Cohen is putting all his eggs into Gamestop, which we have established has insane upward potential,  after more than 2 years of rejecting probably thousands of good opportunities and wants to disrupt an entire industry and clash with Amazon again. Do you really think the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs over at Melvin Capital are going to be able to stop him? If not you better tank up on GME shares now that the share price is low or after the potential short term crash following the ICR conference.\n\nPositions: Yolo on GME shares with a target price of $400 to sell \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nPS: For all you illiterate retards out there here is a TLDR in Emojis: \n\nGME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1a , \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udd2b, \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c = \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0", "author_fullname": "t2_115tnv", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "Why GME stock is going to the \ud83c\udf1a and beyond", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kue1o0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 81, "total_awards_received": 3, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 81, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_2": 1}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610312393.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Okay listen up autists.
