Fortunately enough for me I didn't get completely burnt as I got some 350 puts when it hits 400. So I am still up a bit from snow plays.\n\nI got burnt again second time for the second lock up, which was on Thursday last week.

They probably would sell off slowly to not cause a panic.\n\nI panicked a bit when it hit above 310 last Friday as it looks like it is about to go back to test 340s. But it showed a lot of weakness mid day, so it does appears that pre-ipo investors are slowly dumping their stakes.\n\nI am wondering where would the mm find liquidity. There were definitely liquidity at around 300 level, not sure if there are much at 350 price level, since there are bag holders up there so they would face some selling pressure as well. Based on the movement friday, I felt like the liquidity is running dry above 300s, and it is probably going to 250s very soon or 230 where there should be plenty of people who are willing to hold their bags.\n\nMy question is that do you own any stake in snowflake? Why would anyone buy or not sell at this price range? I don't see a lot of hype here or on other reddit subs. I did see some hypes on stocktwits and twitter. Some people pointed out unusual call option buying activity at $360. But that happened when the stock price was at 320s, the premium quickly faded.
