Well I have a stock for you that will accomplish just that. Moreover I strongly believe it looks primed up for the oh so coveted Infinity Squeeze that we all strive to take a ride on. This company is called Joyy, trading under ticker $YY. \n\n$YY is under attack from our favorite neighborhood short seller Carson Block of Muddy Waters. You may remember him from the report he released on Luckin Coffee (which wasn\u2019t his work) and more recently the report on $GSX (which I agree with and is actually a complete fraud). While I respect Carson, he is dead wrong on $YY and I can tell you with an *extremely* high degree of confidence that he used the bullshit short report to tank the stock and cover a short position he has been long underwater on. I will get into the details in just a minute.\n\nSo WTF is $YY? $YY or Joyy is an extremely popular video streaming platform that owns the apps YY Live, Bigo Live and Huya (which they spun out and sold to Tencent). $YY recently announced that they came to an agreement with Baidu to sell YY Live to them for $3.6 bn. This would leave the company with Bigo Live as the remaining asset and a nice big fat cash balance of $7.1 bn. At a market cap of $7.5 bn, you are basically getting Bigo Live for free. Bigo Live is growing revenues 130%+ per year and is basically the Only Fans of Asia. Tik Tok is worth 20x sales and growing slower. If we even give $YY 1/5th the valuation, this stock will quickly 3X from here. Notice I didn\u2019t say just China...because after they sell YY Live, the company has no China exposure and is headquartered in Singapore. Bigo Live is consistently in the Top 10 grossing apps on Google and Apple App Store globally. \n\n$YY management came out and refuted MWs fraud claims wholeheartedly saying:\n-the report contains errors, unsubstantiated statements and misleading conclusions/interpretations.\n-the company is open to cash verification and diligence to be conducted by competent third-party advisers.\n-announced a $300 mln buyback and massive dividend (FIND ME A FRAUD THAT PAYS ITS SHAREHOLDERS DIVIDENDS...ILL WAIT)\n\nMuddy Waters is stretching to make an insane call. You\u2019re telling me that $YY\u2019s core asset is completely fraudulent and they were able to trick Baidu AND Tencent due diligence teams into buying assets from them for EXTREMELY large sums of money? AND trick GOOGLE AND APPLE TOO!?!? Come the fuck on. We have spoken with countless former employees and competitors who all have said the company is totally legitimate. You\u2019re telling me $YY has planted ex-executives (who have no reason to lie) with expert networks to make false claims? Come the fuck on again. Finally, my MOST IMPORTANT POINT - if you are a top grossing app on the Google or Apple App Store, you are paying a tax of 30% to Google or Apple for all in-app purchases. Muddy waters is claiming 80% of the revenues are false and coming from round tripping/bots of the company. WHY WOULD A COMPANY COMMIT FRAUD BY PAYING THEMSELVES FAKE REVENUE ONLY TO GIVE AWAY 30% OF THIS REVENUE TO GOOGLE AND APPLE!!! COME THE FUCK ON PEOPLE. \n\nAfter the Muddy Waters hit job, Snow Lake Capital\u2019s Ma Ziming revealed in an interview that he was awakened in the early morning to understand the situation, and immediately increased his holdings of $YY stock by $100 million USD. Who is Snow Lake Capital you may ask? Maybe you guys might remember the short report that Muddy Waters put out on Luckin Coffee. This short report was not the work of Muddy Waters but in fact was the work of Ma Ziming\u2019s fund Snow Lake Capital and Muddy Waters simply released it on their behalf. Which makes this $100 million buy of $YY EVEN MORE JUICY.\n\nhttps://xueqiu.com/3582153332/163835924\n\nZhu Xiaohu said in the circle of friends,\"Muddy Waters only dared to short $YY in the second half of the night. Otherwise, you will definitely get beaten up.\u201d Funny enough, Carson Block always releases short reports on Chinese stocks between 3-5am Shanghai time when it\u2019s a position that he covers up quickly.\n\nLast thing I will leave you with is the #1 shareholder of $YY is Lei Jun who is the founder of Xiaomi. He is worth $25bn USD and a top 10 richest guy in China and owns close to $2Bn of $YY stock. He tried to BUY THE ENTIRE COMPANY...All of $YY...at around $70/share a couple years ago. He was the Chairman of the Board. WHY WOULD AN INSIDER TAKE A FRAUD PRIVATE WHEN HE COULD SELL HIS STAKE TO IDIOT U.S. INVESTORS LIKE YOU. This is what normal frauds would do. INSTEAD $YY is paying out dividends and buying back tons of stock from their (according to Muddy Waters) \u201cfake cash pile.\u201d WAKE UP MARKET, Muddy Waters wrote this report in February (that\u2019s when it is dated) and is now releasing it FOR THE FIRST TIME because they have been under water for months on the position and realize this is their chance to get out with Baidu about to buy the company.
