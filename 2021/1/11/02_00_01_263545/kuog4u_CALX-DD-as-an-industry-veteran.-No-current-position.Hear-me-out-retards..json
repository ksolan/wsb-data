Wsb lurker.\n\nWhat I'm writing today about is my insights to broadband technology to the home. Not 5g, aapl or some shit. All the actual products that make your broadband work.\n\nHistory:\nBack in the day (15 to 20 years ago), your main vendors for dsl was alcatel, adtran, AFC/tellabs, the huge companies.\nCisco focused mostly on cable cmts platforms.\nCosts were very high and it was all capital in equipment spending. Profits were also high as anything other than dialup was worth the huge spend.\n \nI have seen dozens of vendors drop off the face of the earth for broadband such as copper mountain, teledyne, zhone (recently back in the picture but not much), pannaway, occam. Tellabs has fallen to an also ran and adtean also lags well behind in innovation and sales.\n\nIn the last few years the focus has been on fiber to the home which is basically the golden ticket.  Whoever gets there first in a city, wins the customers, spawning a huge race.\nCable is still very fast but DSL, even later versions is way too slow, and fiber is the end goal.\n\nI've used calix equipment for over 15 years and have watched it change from an equipment provider to a behemoth of marketing and monthly income.  Here's a short history to summarize:\n\n-calix has competing platform for vdsl, fiber and dial tone with occam networks.  They purchase occam for the platform, thereby merging two of the largest smaller companies into one. 2010.\n\n-calix purchases ericcsons fiber to the home tech in 2012\n\n-2015, calix focuses on moving things to the cloud using aws. They develop everything from management of the end user devices, customer cloud based app for their antivirus, wifi settings, etc.\nAlso a marketing app that pulls all the customer data, speeds, usage and allows providers to contact and upsell.  A complete ecosystem end to end not just an equipment provider.\n\n-calix becomes first ngpon2 supplier for 10 gigabit pon including signing a huge contract with Verizon a few years ago.\n\n-calix becomes the first mesh wifi provider for good in home wifi from ISP, including new wifi6 802.11ax. no other vendor has a wifi6 solution available.\n\nThat takes us up to where we are now.\nSo what's good going forward ?\n\n1) huawei/zte aren't used in north america much anymore as competition.   Bell canada used them a lot for LTE radios in cellular and for gpon fiber. They have been replaced with alcatel-lucent which is now called nokia.  Nokia costs a lot more, most companies do not use them.\n\n2) ceo and founder is Carl Russo, who also founded cerent before selling to cisco for a fortune. Several vp have come from bell canada, microsoft and at&t and are well known experts in their field.\n\n3) sales and profits have been increasing every quarter for years,. Not pump and dump.\n\n4) manufacturing went to Vietnam in the wake of trump and chinese tariffs, so not affected by potential chinese relations with biden taking over.\n\n5) Covid19- the world is working from home, learning from home. This has caused all levels of government to provide massive subsidies and funding to build broadband to rural and semi rural areas where calix is the number one supplier.  With the monthly cloud subscriptions for managing all the customers it's not just sales, but ongoing revenue.\n\n6) they are hiring at a ridiculous pace. Their website has list to all postings.  \n\n7) the last few years and continuing are broadband initiatives i.e. \nhttps://www.calix.com/news-and-events/news-and-media-hub.html\n\n8) financial reports show good growth and ongoing sales trending upwards.
