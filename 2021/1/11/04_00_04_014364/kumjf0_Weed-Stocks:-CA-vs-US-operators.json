I believe the Canada players have distinct advantages. At the end of the day, I think any marijuana stock is a good play to have before the banking reform though, just to be clear. Here's why I think CA is in a better position:\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8U.S marijuana growers are generally required to operate their own retail stores to distribute their product. WA state is one of the few states where vertical integration is prohibited rather than required or encouraged. When is the last time you went to the Budweiser liquor store or bar? Or how about the Marlboro store for cigarettes? I like the Newport stores myself. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44. I believe companies like Trulieve are going to be paying a pretty penny to operate retail stores to sell other people's product. You could say they would only sell their own, but who would shop there vs going to another store or online with more choices? People are leaving the low choice black market and are eager for a wide array of options of legal products. Also, sales directly from farmers in the form of weed subscriptions are going to hurt retail. Retail is gonna be a sample, and when you find something you love you'll be able to just buy it online, cutting out the store. Americans love our farm to table! \n\n\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 Canada on the other hand already has legal online sales of marijuana and dispensaries are privately owned or government operated. Canadians players will obviously have $0 in retail expenses selling to the US market. Not only will they already have extensively better online infrastructure, they are already modeled towards mass production leading to mass shipping to retail AND D2C online sales. These processes are already in place and have had time to work out kinks. \n\nUS marijuana retailers are going to have a difficult time stocking shelves with product that is not their own for quite some time after legalization. It would just make no sense to sell wholesale to retail locations at 50% of the price they get selling D2C. So I see retail locations as more of dead weight rather than some form of a launching board, which most MSOs are married to retail locations. \n\nSo why do I like CGC and CRON. Well CGC is Constellation's (Corona) play on Cannabis and CRON is Altria (Marlboro's) play. Both are currently operating under the online sales model in Canada with deals in place to instantly enter the legal US market as soon as there is one. They may pick up a few retail locations in this too, but will be perfectly ready to market their products and websites online and efficiently ship weed out well before 100% US based plays who have never shipped a single gram of weed, yet. \n\nIf you mad it this far, I'm proud of you retard.
