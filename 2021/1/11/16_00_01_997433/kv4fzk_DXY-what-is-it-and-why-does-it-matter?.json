{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Hey All, \n\nLast Monday I wrote a post on DXY and its increased relevance across the broader market for a different venue and it  has received quite a bit of positive feedback. Since the DXY bounce I flagged in the original post is now playing out while the broader market comes under some downward pressures (SPY, BTC, GOLD), so I figured that I would share the post more broadly. All of the data below is still relevant as it was generally deduced from high timeframe analysis and indicators on 1 week candles. \n\nHere is an updated read on the 1day DXY chart: [https://imgur.com/gallery/QvAepy9](https://imgur.com/gallery/QvAepy9)\n\nThe rest of the post begins below.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI hope everyone is having a fantastic start to the New Year! I wanted my first post to be orientated towards a macro consideration that I think will continue to stay relevant throughout 2021.That brings into focus the title of the post: \"DXY, what is it and why does it matter?\"\n\n**What is DXY?**\n\nDXY is the U.S. Dollar Index and it is an index of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies (the \"Basket Currencies\"). Simply put, DXY goes up when the U.S. dollar gains strength relative to the Basket Currencies and conversely goes down when the U.S. dollar loses strength in comparison to the Basket Currencies.For those that are curious, the composition and weight of the Basket Currencies is:\n\n* Euro (EUR), 57.6% weight\n* Japanese Yen (JPY), 13.6% weight\n* Pound Sterling (GBP), 11.9% weight\n* Canadian Dollar (CAD), 9.1% weight\n* Swedish Krona (SEK), 4.2% weight\n* Swiss franc (CHF), 3.6% weight\n\nMy background is in technical analysis, so it's worth mentioning some of the limitations inherent within DXY for higher timeframe macro analysis:\n\n* DXY was created in 1967, so when looking at DXY on very high timeframe candles (1 year candles, quarterly candles) not all of the higher exponential moving averages (ema's) and simple moving averages (sma's) will be populated. E.g., you would need 200 years of price action to get a 200 ema on a 1 year candle time frame.\n* The composition of the Basket Currencies has only been altered once when the Euro was created at the start of 1999. As a result, some economists feel that the Basket Currencies are overdue for an update to more accurately reflect the current state of global economic affairs. E.g., China, Mexico, Brazil, and South Korea are currently not included in the Basket Currencies.\n\n**Why does DXY Matter?**\n\nDollar strength and rate of inflation have always been a worthwhile consideration when analyzing stocks, commodities, and other assets, but 2020 has brought about a perfect storm of sorts where DXY has become increasingly relevant.The forces that elevated DXY to it's heightened relevance are:\n\n1. Extremely low interest rates, which encourage greater risk appetites in the search for returns on capital.\n2. Inflationary concerns related to the Covid-19 and subsequent fiscal stimulus undertaken by Congress and the Fed.\n   1. M2 has never increased by such a significant percentage.\n\n* M2 Background:\n   * M2 is a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money.\n   * M2 is a broader measure of the money supply than M1, which just includes cash and checking deposits.\n   * M2 is **closely watched as an indicator of money supply and future inflation**, and as a target of central bank monetary policy.\n\nFor example, in 2008 during the \"Great Recession/Financial Crisis\" M2 increased by roughly 10%. In contrast, M2 in 2020 increased by approximately 25%.\n\n1. *See* **M2 Chart**: [https://imgur.com/gallery/H4Gqo7B](https://imgur.com/gallery/H4Gqo7B)\n\nTraditionally, some of the best hedges against inflation are stocks, real estate, treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), and gold and other commodities. In essence, things that are actively priced and traded in dollars will generally accrue in value as the dollar weakens through inflation.In the current economic environment, the perfect storm developed because there is an increasing concern that substantial inflation may be beginning to take place. This inflationary concern is further compounded by there being very little opportunity for decent returns on \"risk free\" money such as FDIC insured deposits and Treasury Bonds. The Fed's general policy is targeting a 2% rate of inflation. However, given the current unprecedented monetary environment it is unknown what the sizable increase in M2 will actually mean for that target rate. If the inflationary rate greatly exceeds 2%, institutions and individuals with massive holdings will be left potentially scrambling to figure out where to park all their money in order to hedge against inflation.Lastly, the above concepts regarding DXY's relevance to the market is further bolstered when one looks at a Correlation Coefficient for DXY vs SPX and BTC.\n\n* *See* **DXY Correlation Coefficient data**: [https://imgur.com/gallery/4gzD8Cm](https://imgur.com/gallery/4gzD8Cm)\n\nThe above shows a correlation coefficient for DXY vs the S&P 500 and BTC/USD. A correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength of the relationship between the relative movements of two assets or variables. The values range between -1.0 (extremely inversely correlated) to 1.0 (extremely correlated). Therefore, a correlation of -1.0 shows a perfect negative correlation while a correlation of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the movement of the two assets.The DXY Correlation Coefficient data shows that DXY is inversely correlated to the S&P 500 at a measure of -0.92 (with -1.0 being a perfect inverse correlation). Meanwhile, the data shows that DXY is inversely correlated with BTC/USD at a measure of -0.88. Surprisingly, it would therefore be reasonable to deduce that DXY going down has a higher impact on the S&P 500 going up than even on BTC/USD increasing in value.**Some Long Term Technical Analysis on DXY**As the 1 month DXY chart below shows, 2020 was a pretty wild year for DXY. DXY broke through a multi-year diagonal trendline and then subsequently re-tested the breakdown area and was rejected. Thereafter, DXY failed to hold above several key horizontal support levels as it continued to weaken into the end of 2020.\n\n* *See* **DXY 1 month candles chart w/ relevant trendlines and horizontal supports**: [https://imgur.com/gallery/wJaIOEU](https://imgur.com/gallery/wJaIOEU)\n\nIn addition, there are further troubling signs for the next year for DXY in that bearish crosses are occurring on relevant exponential moving averages (I flagged the 21 ema and 50 ema cross), while historical volatility percentile is also expanding to the upside. However, 1 month stochastics are very low in the range and the negative slope on the RSI has begun to flatten out, hinting that DXY may not just plummet to the center of the earth tomorrow.\n\n* *See* **DXY 1 month candles chart w/ indicators:** [https://imgur.com/gallery/4MVpP7K](https://imgur.com/gallery/4MVpP7K)\n\nOn lower time frames from 1 week to 1 day, the indicators are suggesting that DXY may indeed attempt a short term bounce attempt. Relevant targets for such a bounce attempt are 90.468, 90.976, 91.43, and 92.237. If the bounce does play out I would expect there to be resulting downward pressure across equities until DXY resumes its downward trajectory. A daily close on DXY below the 89.0 level would invalidate this short term bounce attempt.\n\n* *See* **DXY 1 day chart w/ indicators suggesting potential bounce may be coming:** [https://imgur.com/gallery/vCSMnwq](https://imgur.com/gallery/vCSMnwq)\n\nThanks for the read and I hope the above was helpful in learning a bit about DXY and its increased relevance across the broader markets!", "author_fullname": "t2_83uvjayl", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "DXY, what is it and why does it matter?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Discussion"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_kv4fzk", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610406544.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey All, </p>\n\n<p>Last Monday I wrote a post on DXY and its increased relevance across the broader market for a different venue and it  has received quite a bit of positive feedback.
