However, upon a deeper look, its AN EVEN GREATER DAY for the long-term health of the business.\n\nLet's talk about the current board makeup.

Now, as was indicated in the 13D, \"the Board will be reduced to nine members following the Annual Meeting\", which is in June 2021.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting. For a simple majority, there needs to be 5 members voting in a certain direction. Now, the 3 new members are obviously on Team Cohen. Who else?\n\nWell, we have Kurt Wolf,  Managing Member and Chief Investment Officer of Hestia Capital Management. Given his Hestia's history with GME, he is most definitely going to be on Team Cohen. That's 4/5. So who else? Well, we still have Carrie Teffner, a director who has been on the board since 2018. At first, not much to see. Former CFO of Crocs, who cares.\n\nWell, here's the great part. Before Crocs, she used to be the CFO of Petsmart. Who cares right? Let me ask you this. Who sold their business to Petsmart in 2017? You guessed it - YA BOY COHEN. Granted, she left before the business was sold. BUT, Petsmart had been looking at Chewy for years, and she clearly knows how good of an operator he is. That's 5/9.
