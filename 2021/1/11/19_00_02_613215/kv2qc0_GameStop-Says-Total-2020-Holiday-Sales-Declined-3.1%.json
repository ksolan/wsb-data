(NYSE:**[**GME**](https://pro.benzinga.com/stock/GME#NYSE)**),**\u00a0today reported worldwide sales results for the nine-week holiday period ended January 2, 2021 reflecting a\u00a04.8%\u00a0increase in comparable store sales and a\u00a0309%\u00a0increase in E-Commerce sales.\u00a0 Total sales declined\u00a03.1%\u00a0driven by an\u00a011%\u00a0decrease in the company's store base due to its planned de-densification strategy, temporary store closures around the world due to government mandates and lower store traffic, particularly later in December, due to the significant impacts of COVID-19.\u00a0 The Company believes the industry-wide traffic decline during the Holiday period adversely impacted comparable sales for the nine-week period in the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage point range.\u00a0 In addition, significant worldwide supply chain constraints impacted the ability to distribute products to customers across all sales channels.\u00a0 However, the Company experienced unprecedented demand for recently launched gaming consoles, and while consumer demand far outpaced constrained supply in the nine-week period, the Company believes these products will drive sales well into 2021 as console availability from our suppliers improves later in the year.\u00a0  \n \n\n**Holiday Sales (the nine-week period ended January 2, 2021 compared to the nine-week period ended January 4, 2020)**\n\n* **Total comparable store sales**\u00a0increased\u00a04.8%\u00a0compared to last year and reflected a 29.6 percentage point sequential improvement from the\u00a0third quarter\u00a0of fiscal 2020.\u00a0 These positive results were adversely impacted in the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage point range, as a result of a significant reduction in consumer traffic related to the increase in COVID-19 cases;\n* **Net sales**\u00a0were\u00a0$1.770 billion, a\u00a03.1%\u00a0decrease compared to 2019, as strong console demand was offset by store closures under the Company's planned de-densification strategy, temporary store closures mandated by local governments due to COVID-19, and industry-wide limited supply of new gaming consoles, and supply chain constraints broadly;\n* **E-Commerce sales**, which are included in comparable store sales, rose\u00a0309%\u00a0and represented approximately\u00a034%\u00a0of total company sales, with total worldwide E-Commerce sales year to date reaching over\u00a0$1.35 billion, far exceeding the Company's\u00a0$1.0 billion\u00a0growth objective;\n* **Regional Sales,**\u00a0in Australia/New Zealand, where the Company's operations were materially less impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, total comparable sales for the nine-week period increased approximately\u00a031%, outperforming the Company's other operating regions.\n\nGeorge Sherman, GameStop's chief executive officer said, \"GameStop maintained its status as the omni-channel destination for gaming and entertainment with unprecedented demand for the new gaming consoles and a significant increase in E-Commerce sales.\u00a0 Demand for the new generation of consoles remains very strong, and as a result, we anticipate the consumer's excitement for the new console technology will benefit us going forward well through 2021.\u00a0 We reported a\u00a04.8%\u00a0increase in comparable store sales, including over\u00a0300%\u00a0increase in E-Commerce sales reflecting demand for new consoles, continued strength for Nintendo Switch and our expanded gaming product assortment. While E-Commerce sales contributed approximately\u00a034%\u00a0of total sales for the first nine weeks of the\u00a0fourth quarter, our sales growth progression also includes an adverse impact to comparable transactions related to the meaningful drop in retail traffic during the holiday sales season due to an increase in COVID-19 cases around the world.\"\n\nMr. Sherman continued, \"Overall, we remain confident in both the positive growth aspects for 2021 driven by our strategy to add new and exciting product revenue streams across all things games and entertainment and the strong demand for the new generation for console-based video game products\u00a0 We look forward to executing on both of these areas in 2021 to expand our addressable market and product offerings supported by the many exciting opportunities to leverage our brand, extensive loyalty member base, and improving digital capabilities.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n**Fiscal\u00a0Fourth Quarter\u00a02020\u00a0Outlook\u00a0(13 weeks ending January 30, 2021)**  \n\n\nThe Company continues to focus on efforts that position it to manage through this unprecedented time, including maintaining its balance sheet strength, prioritizing the allocation of resources to areas of the business that produce strong cash flow, reducing expenses across the business, developing and expanding its digital strategy, and intensifying inventory discipline. Due to the uncertainty around the duration and evolving impact of COVID-19, the Company is continuing to suspend\u00a0guidance, however, unless further unforeseen COVID-19 related impacts occur, it expects to realize positive comparable store sales results and profitability in the fiscal\u00a0fourth quarter.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThe Company anticipates reporting\u00a0fourth quarter\u00a0and full fiscal year 2020 results in late March.\u00a0\n\n**About GameStop.**  \n\n\nGameStop Corp., a Fortune 500 company headquartered in Grapevine, Texas, is a digital-first omni-channel retailer, offering games and entertainment products in its over 5,000 stores and comprehensive E-Commerce properties across 10 countries.\u00a0 GameStop, through its family of brands offers the best selection of new and pre-owned video gaming consoles, accessories and video game titles, in both physical and digital formats.\u00a0 GameStop also offers fans a wide variety of POP! vinyl figures, collectibles, board games and more.
