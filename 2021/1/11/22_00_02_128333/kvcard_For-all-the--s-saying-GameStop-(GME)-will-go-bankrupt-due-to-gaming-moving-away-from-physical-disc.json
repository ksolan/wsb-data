RC has indeed addressed this problem. In fact, that's where the ***greatest*** opportunity lies.\n\nFirst off, let me start with some speculation on where RC will be taking GME. There's a lot of speculation that GME will now become the Amazon of the gaming world as the one stop shop for all things gaming. Even if GME is unable to capture gaming sales due to the transition to digital sales, GME is still massively undervalued. GME's collectible business alone generated *737M* in 2019.

Don't forget, these  \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs are betting on *bankruptcy*, ie the stock going to 0. GME just needs to produce a sustainable business model to beat the shorts. Not only that, there's always going to be gaming hardware and supplies sales like consoles, controllers, headsets, gaming chairs. GME also sells TVs, monitors, gaming PCs, etc.\n\nFrom the holiday sales update, we saw GME's E-Commerce sales are up over 300% and now account for 34% of company sales. This is exactly what RC is looking for. GME is already involved in the digital sales business by selling digital games, digital subscriptions, digital gift cards, etc. If GME were to truly becoming a one stop shop for gaming, people would use GME instead of buying directly through their console or PC because while they shop for PS/Xbox games using GME, they can also shop for games for their PC, all while buying gift cards for their friends or purchasing gaming subscriptions like PlayStation Plus.\n\nBut here's the real reason why people will use GME for purchasing digital games. *Online trade-ins.* Say it with me, you beautiful retard. ***Online trade-ins.*** In RC's open letter to the board, he wrote:\n\n\" Significantly upgrading e-commerce can provide for greater revenue capture across larger gaming catalogs, digital content and community experiences, ***online trade-ins***, streaming services and Esports. \"\n\n[https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC\\_Ventures\\_Letter\\_to\\_GameStop.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf)\n\nGME's highest margin revenue stream is physical disc trade-ins. However, if GME is able to create a digital ecosystem where its customers buy all their digital games through GME across all platforms (PC, PS, Xbox, etc), they would be able to trade in their digital games for store credit to buy new digital games. For example, if someone trades in a digital PS5 game, they could use that store credit to buy a PC game. This would keep customers coming back for the same reason people go back to GME today. Furthermore, RC addresses the move towards digital by specifically pointing out \"digital content and community experiences\" and \"streaming services and Esports\".
