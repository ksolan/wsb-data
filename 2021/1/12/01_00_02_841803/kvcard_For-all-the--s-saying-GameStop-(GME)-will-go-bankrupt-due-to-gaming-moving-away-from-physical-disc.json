This is exactly what RC is looking for. GME is already involved in the digital sales business by selling digital games, digital subscriptions, digital gift cards, etc. If GME were to truly becoming a one stop shop for gaming, people would use GME instead of buying directly through their console or PC because while they shop for PS/Xbox games using GME, they can also shop for games for their PC, all while buying gift cards for their friends or purchasing gaming subscriptions like PlayStation Plus.\n\nBut here's the real reason why people will use GME for purchasing digital games. *Online trade-ins.* Say it with me, you beautiful retard. ***Online trade-ins.*** In RC's open letter to the board, he wrote:\n\n\" Significantly upgrading e-commerce can provide for greater revenue capture across larger gaming catalogs, digital content and community experiences, ***online trade-ins***, streaming services and Esports. \"\n\n[https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC\\_Ventures\\_Letter\\_to\\_GameStop.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf)\n\nGME's highest margin revenue stream is physical disc trade-ins. However, if GME is able to create a digital ecosystem where its customers buy all their digital games through GME across all platforms (PC, PS, Xbox, etc), they would be able to trade in their digital games for store credit to buy new digital games. For example, if someone trades in a digital PS5 game, they could use that store credit to buy a PC game. This would keep customers coming back for the same reason people go back to GME today. Furthermore, RC addresses the move towards digital by specifically pointing out \"digital content and community experiences\" and \"streaming services and Esports\".

In fact, most of the times you can find deals in stores for physical games, but for digital you only have Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo as the seller (I know some webpages sell keys but they normally come from bundles that include a key for a game, no disc, and MS has started to not give you a key but rather have the game already linked to the console you bought, to avoid the online resell) so they sell at the price they want to sell and make way more profit than in physical, as they are cutting down the middle man, distribution, manufacturing, etc. And, the point of this discussion, the digital games cannot be traded-in or sold to another person.\n\nSo the benefits of digital (apart from environmental which is good on itself) for the costumer are just the convenience of not having to move their ass to a store, not having to swap disks when they want to change games and the possibility of sharing their digital games with other people (this is somewhat complex and requires confidence between parties, you basically link the account where the game is bought with 2 different consoles, one which is the console where said account is normally logged in and another one which is the receiver of the share. This way both accounts have access to the same license of this game). Microsoft and Sony probably know that people share the digital licenses by this method, but allow it because they rather have players buy digital than physical (hence why they pushed it with the new consoles).\n\nThe biggest point against digital that I read in online forums is that you cannot trade the games, neither with a store or another player. I have no problems imagining MS and Sony (Nintendo's policies are retarded) banning this license sharing but allowing for trades with stores and maybe with other players.

In fact, most of the times you can find deals in stores for physical games, but for digital you only have Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo as the seller (I know some webpages sell keys but they normally come from bundles that include a key for a game, no disc, and MS has started to not give you a key but rather have the game already linked to the console you bought, to avoid the online resell) so they sell at the price they want to sell and make way more profit than in physical, as they are cutting down the middle man, distribution, manufacturing, etc. And, the point of this discussion, the digital games cannot be traded-in or sold to another person.</p>\n\n<p>So the benefits of digital (apart from environmental which is good on itself) for the costumer are just the convenience of not having to move their ass to a store, not having to swap disks when they want to change games and the possibility of sharing their digital games with other people (this is somewhat complex and requires confidence between parties, you basically link the account where the game is bought with 2 different consoles, one which is the console where said account is normally logged in and another one which is the receiver of the share. This way both accounts have access to the same license of this game).
