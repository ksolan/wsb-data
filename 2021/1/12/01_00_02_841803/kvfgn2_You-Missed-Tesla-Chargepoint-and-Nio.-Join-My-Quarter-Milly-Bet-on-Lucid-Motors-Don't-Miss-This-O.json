{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Today, Bloomberg released a report that CCIV (a SPAC) is considering taking Lucid Motors public. \"Blah Blah another EV play, who cares?\" You should. Outside of Tesla, the two legit pure play EV companies with legitimate prospects are Lucid and Rivian. Both private until now. \n\nBy the way, I have over $250k invested in this play:   [https://imgur.com/a/Lyq2lkC](https://imgur.com/a/Lyq2lkC)\n\nand I'm the guy who went from $6k to almost $300k in the last year on SPACs:  \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/c8prUGU](https://imgur.com/a/c8prUGU)\n\nI'd like to say I know this area well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo why Lucid? Let's start with the CEO Peter Rawlinson. [https://www.lucidmotors.com/company/leadership/peter-rawlinson/](https://www.lucidmotors.com/company/leadership/peter-rawlinson/) Peter was the chief engineer on the Tesla Model S, designing the vehicle from the ground up. He started Lucid because he wanted to \"Make an electric vehicle that would appeal more to the luxury customer that drives a Mercedes or BMW. Tesla's are great, but they aren't beautiful.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince then, he has designed the Lucid Air. [https://www.lucidmotors.com/air/specs](https://www.lucidmotors.com/air/specs) The Air is a 0 to 60 luxury sedan with a 500 mile battery range. It was named Forbes' electric car of the year, and is viewed as the only true competitor to Elon's lineage of vehicles. The Lucid Air also has state of the art charging capabilities, where you can get a 300 mile range charge in 20 minutes on a DC charging station. Range anxiety, one of the biggest issues for EV drivers, is no longer a problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile the Air is the main selling point (and it comes on market this year), the company is also rolling out \"Project Gravity\", an electric SUV that will hit the market in 2023. While 0 revenue EV companies like Fisker, Nikola, and Canoo have all come to the market with no product for several years, Lucid is planning to IPO with its main vehicle selling this year. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy can we trust the CCIV rumor? Michael Klein, former Citi exec, is the head of Churchill Capital, the group behind this SPAC. While Klein's last SPAC performed poorly (Multiplan, CCXX), and CCX lost the TopGolf merger that it was rumored with, Klein is very experienced in this area. Frankly, he needs a good hit with CCIV, so a company like Lucid would put him back on the map. Given Lucid's lofty valuation (potentially $15B) only two SPACs could realistically handle the deal: PSTH and CCIV. CCIV has a $2B trust account. Additionally, Lucid is majority owned by the Saudi royal family, who Klein has strong ties with.

In a world where Tesla is worth $800B and Nio is $100B, Lucid Motors is poised to take off. They have every incentive to push for this deal to happen as hype will pick up with Lucid deliveries starting. Right now CCIV is trading around $14, and I fully expect it to run to $30+.
