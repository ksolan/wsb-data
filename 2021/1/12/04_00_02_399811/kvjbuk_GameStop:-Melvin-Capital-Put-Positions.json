If you are a smooth brain stick to TLDR**\n\n**TLDR: Gay Melvin bears are fuk when their 51000 FD puts expire on Friday**\n\nIn November a fellow autist, u/ronoron, wrote an excellent DD detailing Melvin Capital Put positions on GameStop which you can read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3gn91/people_pumping_gme_melvin_capital_management/). He found that Melvin Capital held a short position of GameStop of 54,000 15 Put Contracts exp Jul 16 2021 equaling their disclosed short exposure of 5,400,000 shares on the [Q3 13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110000090571820001111/0000905718-20-001111-index.htm) form.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Short Interest vs. Share Price](https://preview.redd.it/qpoz2i4agra61.jpg?width=3038&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=544c69e831f419afc6cdf5f87853d57b2ac58225)\n\nSince that DD, GameStop has risen to a high of $23.35, Ryan Cohen increased his stake to 12.9% along with obtaining board seats for himself and Chewy CFO and COO. The Q4 13F form for Melvin Capital will be released on February 16 so their concise short exposure isn't public yet.\n\n[Melvin 13F Ending 9\\/30\\/20](https://preview.redd.it/di6hfhz0gra61.png?width=2576&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb9dd25d1f1a6c9b53fc2f5584fbbcb4ea7d9dc)\n\nThrough the OI on the options chain we can get a decent enough picture of the institutional short positions and which positions Melvin Capital and other Institutions are likely holding. As of EOD Jan 11, the open interest on Melvin Capitals Jul 15p is down 88% to 620. We will see in their new 13F if they fully closed their position however after some further investigation, I believe they rolled their position to Jan 15.\n\nOn the 15 Jan 21 chain, there is significant open interest for the 24 put. Currently 51025 contracts are open which is a similar quantity to Melvins July puts. Melvin Capital is the only institution with such a large put position publicly disclosed.\n\n[\\\\\"Fuck your puts\\\\\" -JPow](https://preview.redd.it/kw0u0igljta61.png?width=1947&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6aa82e353606c84433e230fcc51842de185e823)\n\nSecondly, the lower strike puts (Under $10) have significant OI. There is a specific block of puts, strike 5-10, totaling 57155 in open interest. These strikes have disproportionate OI to comparable strikes and other expiration dates. Melvin Capital is retarded but they aren't stupid. To hedge their long put position of 15 Jan 24 puts, they would open up put debit spreads to cap their max loss and cheapen their positions.\n\nImportantly, their 24 Put FD's are decently fuk. Accounting for the average expected move, their position has an 81% chance of closing ITM. Overall those puts have been destroyed by GME's increase in value and theta decay. If you remember Ryan Cohen just announced his board seat than Melvins position is looking seriously precarious. They cannot escape their position right now since they have gone all in on one strike which is significantly illiquid. Trying to sell would crater the bid/ask.\n\nAccounting for all of this, todays price action makes a good amount of sense. After the board announcement, the stock rose in PM over 21% briefly before getting crushed. Simultaneously, shares available to borrow on IBKR dried up from 45,000 to just 100 shares. Fidelity experienced similar action. Someone is going all in trying to keep the price down and it stands to reason it is Melvin, the only institution with FD puts and an underwater position. They have the capital to keep the price down for this week until their position expires and by no means face solvency issue.\n\nShort interest update will be updated tomorrow and I bet it is up bigly. All this selling pressure isn't coming from profit takers especially with such low borrowing availability.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tpuciifxlta61.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=23f0a371de79cffb21de32edce9d3249b87323a5\n\nThe most important factor here is delta hedging from whichever Market Makers wrote the puts for Melvin. Contrary to WSB belief, they are not out just to fuck over retards. They are supposed to be delta neutral to avoid conflicts with customer interest. This means they will hedge their short options positions with Delta\\*Contracts number of shares. For the week ending 15 January, the total hedging is disproportionately short at -8124390 shares. Those are all shares MM as an aggregate sold to neutralize their positions. As they unwind their positions on Friday, MM's will be buying back a decent portion of those shares. This unwinding happens every week however volume is typically more balanced and less of an effect is felt.\n\n*Processing img 4dn5x8zemta61...*\n\nAll of this evidence points towards massive upside for next week. Melvins short selling pressure should be off and a significant degree of institutional buying should be expected as those positions are unwound. Melvin will presumably start unwinding their short positions after their puts expire which will increase upward pressure. The shorts are more fuk than you would believe and if Melvins puts are worthless by Friday the top is blowing off.", "author_fullname": "t2_58lkkbu7", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null,
