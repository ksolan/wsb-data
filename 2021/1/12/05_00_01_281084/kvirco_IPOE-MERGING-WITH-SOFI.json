SoFi is a Fintech unicorn that I believe has the chance to become the Amazon and Netflix of financial services. They started off just re-financing Student Loans, but now they offer a full suite of products that includes a bank account, credit cards, personal loans, home loans, and an investment platform. Last April they acquired Galileo, a digital payments platform that enables checking and savings account functionality. Some popular companies that use Galileo are  Robinhood, Revolut, Transferwise and Chime.\n\nJust like Amazon and Netflix put an end to brick and mortar book stores and video stores, this the beginning of the end to brick and mortar banks. As more and more people are moving towards managing their finances digitally, there will be less physical banks that stick around. Currently, all major banks have a digital platform, but SoFI was built from the ground up to dominate this shift into a digital bank.\n\nLooking at SoFi's investor presentation, we can see that they have grown their members by 75% YOY, and expect to be EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) positive for the year 2021. In fact they just released that they just turned a profit this quarter. If we look at Tesla, they were trading sideways for several years, until they first turned a profit in late 2019. From there, we all know what happened to Tesla's stock. Based on projections, SoFi is expecting earnings for $1.177B in the year 2025. If Sofi is valued at the same PE ratio of Square, another fintech company, we can expect the stock to be priced at $495 in 2025 assuming SoFi manages to meet their projections. This would be an increase of over 25,000% over the next 5 years.\n\nTDLR: IPOE  \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "author_fullname": "t2_4ymouby6", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "IPOE MERGING WITH SOFI", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kvirco", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 31, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 1}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610449103.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>These are just my opinions, do your own due diligence.</p>\n\n<p>On Thursday, IPOE announced that they will be merging with SoFi.
