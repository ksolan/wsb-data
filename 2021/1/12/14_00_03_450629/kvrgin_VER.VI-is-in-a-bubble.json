{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Verbund AG ([VER.VI](https://VER.VI)) is a utility company in Austria that trades on the Vienna Stock Exchange and operates the Austrian high-voltage grid as well as a lot of renewable power plants in Austria and Germany. It's up more than 60% since September and I'll show why I believe it's in a bubble. \n\nFirst of all, let's have a look at its largest holders: Around 80% of all outstanding stock belong to the Austrian federal government (\\~51%) and to three municipal utility providers in Austria, which leaves only 20% of shares (around 66 million) floating.\n\nThe stock is included in several large ETFs, the most important of which being the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN), which tracks the S&P Global Clean Energy Index. The weight of the ICLN is 4.5 percent.\n\n* As of today, [VER.VI](https://VER.VI) is the ICLN's fifth-biggest position and the ICLN holds 3.1 million shares, or slightly below 5% of the total float. \n* This is up from 600 thousand at April 09, 2020 and 2.63 million at EoY 2020, which means that just this fund bought almost half a million shares in 7 trading days. \n* However, notice that the average volume of [VER.VI](https://VER.VI) is only slightly above 200.000 shares; the last days were busier than average with a total of 1.8 million shares traded this year. If you do the math, you'll find out that over one in every four shares traded in the last few days was bought by the ICLN. Assuming that a lot of the volume is generated by day traders, most long-term investment into [VER.VI](https://VER.VI) is done by the ICLN. \n* The ETF and green energy hype drove the price up because index funds HAVE to buy, they don't WANT to.\n* Once ICLN stops growing this fast, or the index rebalances at the expense of [VER.VI](https://VER.VI) (it rebalances in April and October), it will rebound to 40-50 euros. \n\nHow to get on this: I sadly can't trade any options, but there are good warrants around expiring between Q3 2021 and Q1 2022.\n\nBonus: It's very much possible that this applies to other stocks in the ICLN too (I didn't look at the others yet).  \n\n \n\nDisclaimer: This is of course not financial advice and it's up to yourselves to make any investment decisions.
