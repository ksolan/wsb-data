But how is this possible, I thought clean energy was invented in 2015 you say?? You see, in June of 2008 the a barrel of [West Texas Intermediate](https://imgur.com/a/jIggkVb) (WTI) spiked up to $147 and then down to $32 in December 2008.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[WTI \\($\\/barrel, not adjusted for inflation\\)](https://preview.redd.it/dhcusfsl9xa61.png?width=1692&format=png&auto=webp&s=b035d7440b567a06b2c5e2385c63eb7e1ccaa81b)\n\n## The Oil Crisis of 2008\n\nSomeone could do a whole write-up on that topic, but basically, oil supply and demand curves are highly inelastic. If oil supplier A is blown up in a terrorist attack or nationalized in a socialist revolution, oil supplier B can\u2019t just drill a new well immediately. That\u2019s basically what happened in 2008, due to the political situations in several different countries in a short time period, oil production was severely disrupted and with increasing demand, this caused the spot price to soar.\n\nCoincidentally, BlackRock offered ICLN to the public for the first time in June of 2008, at the peak of the oil spike at $50/share. With the spot price of oil at insane levels, talk of \u201cpeak oil\u201d in the zeitgeist, democrats talking about addressing climate change head on with a cap-and-trade bill, investors suddenly were dreaming of the post-oil future. There was a lot of interest in investing in green energy companies. Who wouldn\u2019t want to buy shares in Chevron in 1897, right?\n\nWell, unfortunately for the retards that gobbled up whatever BlackRock was peddling, June 2008 was a bad time to go long on any security, as Lehman Brothers would file for bankruptcy in September which would create a global recession and swift fall in oil prices as demand plummets during recessions. With a barrel of oil cheaper once again cheaper than a keg of bud lite, green energy stocks plummeted.\n\n# Climate Change\n\nIn case you were eating crayons in grade school,  you see, carbon emissions are heating up the planet and it\u2019s creating an increase in extreme weather events such as droughts, wildfires, severe snowstorms, tropical storms and the like. Even if you don\u2019t give a shit the polar bears or Australia\u2019s tourism industry or Florida, the extreme weather events are not ideal.\n\nSo let\u2019s solve climate change then? There is a big problem though. Actually solving climate change has this unfortunate effect of reducing the viability of companies in the O&G sector, which means if passed, O&G workers will lose their jobs.\n\nDoubly unfortunate for the democrats, O&G workers are concentrated in a bunch of swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Texas etc. These states have entire cities where the local economy is entirely dependent on O&G companies.\n\nYour average democratic primary voter though, does not live in one of those cities. Their general attitude can be (somewhat unfairly) boiled down to \u201cwe have to do this thing that\u2019s morally important to me, and we have to make some sacrifices, and you will have to lose your job and I will keep mine, but we have to make sacrifices, or the world will LITERALLY end by 2040.\u201d\n\n# The cap-and-trade bill of 2009\n\nThere is a quite straightforward solution to climate change: cap-and-trade. The idea is that every year government will offer permits to emit X tons of CO2 and sell these to the highest bidder. These will then be tradable assets. So it\u2019s a market based system, where the price of the permits directly reduce the competitiveness of fossil fuels when zero-carbon energy is also available.\n\nSo in 2009, Obama admin with Senate democrats came out with this plan to fix climate change, known as the [\u201cCap-and-Trade Bill\u201d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Clean_Energy_and_Security_Act).\n\nCap-and-Trade was immediately unpopular among Americans, republicans and blue dog democrats seized on the opportunity to shit on Obama for his job-killing tree-hugging agenda, with hilarious ads such as this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=20&v=xIJORBRpOPM&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=20&v=xIJORBRpOPM&feature=youtu.be)\n\nAs you can see in the ad, Joe Manchin eventually killed the cap-and-trade bill and West Virginia\u2019s coal industry was revived (no it wasn\u2019t, because coal isn\u2019t competitive with O&G anymore).\n\nFrom here on out, a rift emerged amongst democrats and republicans, because the liberal democratic party primary voters DEMAND action on climate change while the electoral college and the senate punish action on climate change. So the issue these days is more polarized than abortion (actually).\n\n# Biden\u2019s Energy plan\n\nNow, the environment & healthcare were and continue to be the top issues for the democratic base, including its most active voices. Biden may have lost some of these voters in the primary, but he brought them into his coalition in the general and won the white house.\n\nBasically Biden needs to throw some ~~red meat~~ vegan burger patties at the base.\n\nNow, Green New Deal doesn\u2019t include any mention of a carbon tax or cap-and-trade, I assume, because socialists hate market-based solutions that actually work. Instead it asks for a $100T in infrastructure spending.\n\nWith Joe Manchin still in the Senate, locked & loaded ready to shoot cap-and-trade again, that\u2019s not happening anyway.\n\nBut as it happens, this green infrastructure spending isn\u2019t such a bad idea. Because infrastructure spending is popular across the aisle. It creates jobs, and does not directly destroy O&G jobs. As we saw this year, the treasury can just sell trillions of bonds with no downside and JPOW will happily exchange them for real dollars.\n\nAnd the end goal of Democrats is to try to use that money to get a bunch of people in the Sunbelt and Texas employed in green energy, as an electoral counterweight to everyone employed in O&G.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSo Biden's plan will not include a carbon tax or cap-and-trade bill, or at least won't focus on it. Instead it will involve pumping trillions into green energy infrastructure with the goal of getting Americans across the Sunbelt & Texas employed in Green Energy, as an electoral counterweight to all those employed in O&G. Getting people dependent on green energy in swing states is the only path forward for democrats.\n\nIn other words, Biden will order Mama Yellen to sell trillions and trillions of Treasury bonds, which JPOW will happily exchange for real dollars, which will then be used to give fat government contracts to ICLN\u2019s holdings and beyond.\n\n# How to monetize this:\n\nICLN\u2019s holdings are only 34% US based. Which is less than ideal because Biden's platform includes \"Buy American\" and one of their political goals is to employ as many Americans as possible in green energy, so I expect them to prioritize American companies when handing out contracts. Though of course, if Biden is pumping a million trillion into solar, I can't imagine South Korean solar panel producers don't also get some of that.\n\nACES (another clean energy ETF) is 80% US and 20% Canadian, and TAN (solar focused) is 50% US. ACES is lower volume though and has fewer strikes so it's up to you, I think it's getting slept on here.\n\nAdditionally, if you don't already have enough exposure to TSLA through stock, options and ARKK, QCLN is another option similar to ICLN.\n\n# Positions:\n\n50 shares each of TAN, ACES. 100 shares of ICLN\n\n5x TAN 4/16 125c\n\n5x ICLN 7/16 31c\n\n4x ACES 6/18 96c", "author_fullname": "t2_845oem6r", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Clean Energy Politics DD: ICLN and more", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 86, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"dhcusfsl9xa61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 66, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dhcusfsl9xa61.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c7a3affc7247df2f228679d53558044154f2cc00"}, {"y": 133, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dhcusfsl9xa61.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f65b5b1608de79292837792aaf2745187b6a622b"}, {"y": 198, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dhcusfsl9xa61.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d566debc70da8a9a752494aeed12e7b30a9fe0d9"}, {"y": 396, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dhcusfsl9xa61.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=8a793839ee55c3d6927bd6901b3f69a5be9592f0"}, {"y": 594, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dhcusfsl9xa61.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b69165890d18d5c492f40172a558d28d88cc423c"}, {"y": 668, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dhcusfsl9xa61.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=514a32f7ebe9fad781b3e6dbf4b6396b3163b30b"}], "s": {"y": 1048, "x": 1692, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dhcusfsl9xa61.png?width=1692&format=png&auto=webp&s=b035d7440b567a06b2c5e2385c63eb7e1ccaa81b"}, "id": "dhcusfsl9xa61"}, "k9z54wmj9xa61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 55, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k9z54wmj9xa61.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c14038880f59111b29cec498c00581ba178fa65c"}, {"y": 111, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k9z54wmj9xa61.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=77c58307bc3914e3743c961423cc0896046375f4"}, {"y": 165, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k9z54wmj9xa61.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=fe09bbd7dbc7628c62a8144c2d9337d33a101e30"}, {"y": 330, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k9z54wmj9xa61.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=86bb209688921fd9a7573bbbc9629c08af77ac09"}], "s": {"y": 448, "x": 868, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k9z54wmj9xa61.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b05e63aae5750ba75bd9485d58ad49135f337d8"}, "id": "k9z54wmj9xa61"}}, "name": "t3_kvu91m", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 44, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {"content": "<iframe class=\"embedly-embed\" src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2Fa%2FjIggkVb%2Fembed%3Fpub%3Dtrue%26ref%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fembed.ly%26w%3D900&display_name=Imgur&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2Fa%2FjIggkVb&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FuzsWqqY.jpg%3Ffb&key=2aa3c4d5f3de4f5b9120b660ad850dc9&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=imgur\" width=\"600\" height=\"411\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Imgur embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>", "width": 600, "scrolling": false, "height": 411}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": {"oembed": {"provider_url": "http://imgur.com", "description": "Post with 0 views.
