SoFi hiring is seeking to fill key banking positions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Targeting $1 Billion in 2021 revenue & full year profitability**\n\nSoFi's target looks well within reach. They reported \\~$200MM in revenue and a return to profitability for Q3 2020.\n\n>... pulled in about $200 million in revenue in the third quarter and also generated positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and other exceptions, the first time it has done so since 2017, Noto wrote in a letter to shareholders last month.\n\nper [The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/sofi-q3-revenue-hit-200-million-aided-by-low-rates).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Credit Card**\n\nCurrently in Early Access, the [SoFi Credit Card](https://www.sofi.com/credit-card/) is expected to roll out to everyone in 2021. [Credit Card FAQs](https://support.sofi.com/hc/en-us/categories/360004370091-SoFi-Credit-Card-NEW-).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Financial Services Productivity Loop**\n\nThe \"FSPL\" is the core of SoFi's B2C products.\n\nFrom the [S-4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921002757/tm211402-1_s4.htm):\n\n>Our strategy, what we refer to as the \"Financial Services Productivity Loop\", is centered around building trust and a lifetime relationship with our members, which we believe will help build a sustainable competitive advantage. In order to deliver on our strategy, we must develop best in class unit economics and best in class products that build trust and reliability between our members and our platform. When we do this on a member's first product, and they later consider using a second product, they are more likely to start with our platform and we have a higher chance that they will select one of our products to meet their other financial needs. **This results in delivering more revenue per member with no second member acquisition costs, resulting in higher lifetime value per member.** This also reinforces the benefits of our platform, which simplifies the entire financial ecosystem for our members, helping them get their money right. We are able to use the increased profits to further improve member benefits and product experience.\n\nSoFi seeks to fulfill all of a Member's financial needs in one [super app](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErKm-aVVgAIxMyd?format=jpg&name=4096x4096). Here is a [FSPL visual](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921001951/tm211973d1_ex99x2x009.jpg).\n\nHow is it going? **SoFi reports 24% overall cross-buy of products for Q3 20. They hit 69% for Home Loans.** As SoFi's products mature and deploy, their cross-buy will continue to grow, while Member acquisition costs will decrease.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SoFi International Expansion**\n\nSoFi's international expansion was announced in Q2 2020 with the launch of [SoFi Invest in Hong Kong](https://www.sofi.com/blog/sofi-invest-comes-to-hong-kong/).\n\n>Obviously, we put a lot of thought into where we chose to go with our first international foothold, and Hong Kong made sense to us for several reasons. As one of the financial capitals of Asia and a global financial center, it has a strong base of both novice and sophisticated investors that would benefit from the innovation we could bring to the market.\n\nMembers in HK can trade over 15,000 US and Hong Kong stocks for free using the SoFi Hong Kong app. This is one of SoFi's FSPL \"[top of the funnel](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921001951/tm211973d1_ex99x2x024.jpg)\" feeder products. Look for HK offerings to expand.\n\nSoFi has long planned for international expansion. From targeting [mortgages in Australia (old)](https://australianfintech.com.au/us-fintech-sofi-targets-mortgage-lending-in-australia/), [expansion to Canada (old)](https://impactalpha.com/sofi-raises-500-million-to-expand-to-australia-and-canada-441b6d84f1f0/), [Asia and Europe (old)](https://www.altfi.com/article/2322_sofi_going_global_targets_asia_and_europe). SoFi is positioned for international deployment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SoFi Stadium**\n\nSoFi Stadium will drive brand awareness and accelerate trust building. These are both key for growth in consumer finance.\n\nSome major events are already lined up:\n\n>The state-of-the-art stadium re-imagines the fan experience and will host a variety of events year round including **Super Bowl LVI in 2022**, the **College Football Championship Game in 2023**, and the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the **Olympic Games in 2028**.\n\nLocated in LA, this massive stadium is packed with benefits for SoFi Members, including line skipping, 10% cash back on concessions and merch, free bag checking, and an exclusive **SoFi Member Lounge**.\n\nSoFi was planning to IPO at the end of 2022, which we can assume was in part due to the expected Super Bowl bump. More info at [SoFi Stadium](https://www.sofi.com/sofi-stadium/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Member Experiences**\n\nSoFi has hosted free in-person Member Experiences for years. These include social events at Top Golf, escape rooms, bars/dining, theaters, sport events, and so on. As well as teaching events in line with SoFi's \"Get Your Money Right!\" ethos. There are big celebration events for Members who have paid off their student loans in full.\n\nWhen the virus put a pause to in-person events, SoFi expanded their digital experiences. Over 20,000 Members registered for virtual SoFi events in 2020.\n\nAs virus re-openings expand, look for [SoFi Stadium](https://www.sofi.com/sofi-stadium/) opportunities and [Member Experiences](https://www.sofi.com/experiences/) to increase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Apex Clearing**\n\nRecognize that name from your brokerage tax forms? SoFi has a \\~17% stake in Apex Clearing, which provides brokerage clearing services, margin lending, compliance, transfers, and more.\n\nFrom the [S-4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921002757/tm211402-1_s4.htm):\n\n>In December\u00a02018, we purchased a 16.7% interest in Apex, which resulted in partial integration of the transaction clearing and asset custody functions integral to SoFi Invest. The investment has also **enabled us to participate in earnings from Apex's customer base**. As of September\u00a030, 2020, our ownership interest in Apex was 16.8%.  \n>  \n>Our equity method investment in Apex primarily benefits us in two ways: First, it facilitates better planning, coordination and integration in the technology stack for SoFi Invest, which requires clearing brokerage services. **Second, we benefit from the income earned on providing clearing brokerage services to other institutions, and earn fees for margin lending and pay-for-order flow, the latter of which consists of arrangements whereby exchanges and market-makers pay for routing them certain orders.**\n\nApex's clients include **Ally Invest, M1, Wealthfront, Stash, Betterment**, and others.\n\nLearn about [Apex Clearing's solutions](https://www.apexclearing.com/solutions/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Future acquisitions**\n\nOnce SoFi's public listing via spac merger is complete, look for more strategic acquisitions. SoFi will be loaded with \\~$3B in cash. Plus their newly public stock as acquisition currency.\n\nStrategic targets may include more infrastructure providers and geographically appealing startups.\n\nSoFi's entry into HK shows the global expansion model: Buy the local regulatory approvals overnight via a small startup, re-brand, and deploy SoFi's tech stack and talent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ARK Invest?**\n\nSoFi has been on ARK's radar for years. It is assumed that ARK will build a position, which will blanket SoFi in ARK's halo. Possible buyers would be funds ARKF (Fintech), ARKW (Next Generation Internet), and perhaps the queen, ARKK.\n\nCoverage at [https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kta42h/ark\\_invest\\_interested\\_in\\_sofi\\_since\\_2018\\_buckle/](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kta42h/ark_invest_interested_in_sofi_since_2018_buckle/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Possible tax solution & other additions**\n\nA couple months ago SoFi [surveyed Members](/r/sofi/comments/jec6xz/sofi_might_be_considering_tax_software/) about a possible tax filing solution. Maybe it will launch for this tax filing season.\n\nAt the start of 2021, SoFi asked for input on which new features to prioritize.

When we do this on a member&#39;s first product, and they later consider using a second product, they are more likely to start with our platform and we have a higher chance that they will select one of our products to meet their other financial needs. <strong>This results in delivering more revenue per member with no second member acquisition costs, resulting in higher lifetime value per member.</strong> This also reinforces the benefits of our platform, which simplifies the entire financial ecosystem for our members, helping them get their money right. We are able to use the increased profits to further improve member benefits and product experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>SoFi seeks to fulfill all of a Member&#39;s financial needs in one <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErKm-aVVgAIxMyd?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096\">super app</a>. Here is a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921001951/tm211973d1_ex99x2x009.jpg\">FSPL visual</a>.</p>\n\n<p>How is it going? <strong>SoFi reports 24% overall cross-buy of products for Q3 20. They hit 69% for Home Loans.</strong> As SoFi&#39;s products mature and deploy, their cross-buy will continue to grow, while Member acquisition costs will decrease.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>SoFi International Expansion</strong></p>\n\n<p>SoFi&#39;s international expansion was announced in Q2 2020 with the launch of <a href=\"https://www.sofi.com/blog/sofi-invest-comes-to-hong-kong/\">SoFi Invest in Hong Kong</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, we put a lot of thought into where we chose to go with our first international foothold, and Hong Kong made sense to us for several reasons. As one of the financial capitals of Asia and a global financial center, it has a strong base of both novice and sophisticated investors that would benefit from the innovation we could bring to the market.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Members in HK can trade over 15,000 US and Hong Kong stocks for free using the SoFi Hong Kong app. This is one of SoFi&#39;s FSPL &quot;<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921001951/tm211973d1_ex99x2x024.jpg\">top of the funnel</a>&quot; feeder products. Look for HK offerings to expand.</p>\n\n<p>SoFi has long planned for international expansion. From targeting <a href=\"https://australianfintech.com.au/us-fintech-sofi-targets-mortgage-lending-in-australia/\">mortgages in Australia (old)</a>, <a href=\"https://impactalpha.com/sofi-raises-500-million-to-expand-to-australia-and-canada-441b6d84f1f0/\">expansion to Canada (old)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.altfi.com/article/2322_sofi_going_global_targets_asia_and_europe\">Asia and Europe (old)</a>. SoFi is positioned for international deployment.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>SoFi Stadium</strong></p>\n\n<p>SoFi Stadium will drive brand awareness and accelerate trust building. These are both key for growth in consumer finance.</p>\n\n<p>Some major events are already lined up:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The state-of-the-art stadium re-imagines the fan experience and will host a variety of events year round including <strong>Super Bowl LVI in 2022</strong>, the <strong>College Football Championship Game in 2023</strong>, and the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the <strong>Olympic Games in 2028</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Located in LA, this massive stadium is packed with benefits for SoFi Members, including line skipping, 10% cash back on concessions and merch, free bag checking, and an exclusive <strong>SoFi Member Lounge</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>SoFi was planning to IPO at the end of 2022, which we can assume was in part due to the expected Super Bowl bump. More info at <a href=\"https://www.sofi.com/sofi-stadium/\">SoFi Stadium</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Member Experiences</strong></p>\n\n<p>SoFi has hosted free in-person Member Experiences for years. These include social events at Top Golf, escape rooms, bars/dining, theaters, sport events, and so on. As well as teaching events in line with SoFi&#39;s &quot;Get Your Money Right!&quot; ethos. There are big celebration events for Members who have paid off their student loans in full.</p>\n\n<p>When the virus put a pause to in-person events, SoFi expanded their digital experiences. Over 20,000 Members registered for virtual SoFi events in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>As virus re-openings expand, look for <a href=\"https://www.sofi.com/sofi-stadium/\">SoFi Stadium</a> opportunities and <a href=\"https://www.sofi.com/experiences/\">Member Experiences</a> to increase.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Apex Clearing</strong></p>\n\n<p>Recognize that name from your brokerage tax forms? SoFi has a ~17% stake in Apex Clearing, which provides brokerage clearing services, margin lending, compliance, transfers, and more.</p>\n\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921002757/tm211402-1_s4.htm\">S-4</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In December\u00a02018, we purchased a 16.7% interest in Apex, which resulted in partial integration of the transaction clearing and asset custody functions integral to SoFi Invest. The investment has also <strong>enabled us to participate in earnings from Apex&#39;s customer base</strong>. As of September\u00a030, 2020, our ownership interest in Apex was 16.8%.  </p>\n\n<p>Our equity method investment in Apex primarily benefits us in two ways: First, it facilitates better planning, coordination and integration in the technology stack for SoFi Invest, which requires clearing brokerage services. <strong>Second, we benefit from the income earned on providing clearing brokerage services to other institutions, and earn fees for margin lending and pay-for-order flow, the latter of which consists of arrangements whereby exchanges and market-makers pay for routing them certain orders.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apex&#39;s clients include <strong>Ally Invest, M1, Wealthfront, Stash, Betterment</strong>, and others.</p>\n\n<p>Learn about <a href=\"https://www.apexclearing.com/solutions/\">Apex Clearing&#39;s solutions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Future acquisitions</strong></p>\n\n<p>Once SoFi&#39;s public listing via spac merger is complete, look for more strategic acquisitions. SoFi will be loaded with ~$3B in cash. Plus their newly public stock as acquisition currency.</p>\n\n<p>Strategic targets may include more infrastructure providers and geographically appealing startups.</p>\n\n<p>SoFi&#39;s entry into HK shows the global expansion model: Buy the local regulatory approvals overnight via a small startup, re-brand, and deploy SoFi&#39;s tech stack and talent.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>ARK Invest?</strong></p>\n\n<p>SoFi has been on ARK&#39;s radar for years. It is assumed that ARK will build a position, which will blanket SoFi in ARK&#39;s halo. Possible buyers would be funds ARKF (Fintech), ARKW (Next Generation Internet), and perhaps the queen, ARKK.</p>\n\n<p>Coverage at <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kta42h/ark_invest_interested_in_sofi_since_2018_buckle/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kta42h/ark_invest_interested_in_sofi_since_2018_buckle/</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Possible tax solution &amp; other additions</strong></p>\n\n<p>A couple months ago SoFi <a href=\"/r/sofi/comments/jec6xz/sofi_might_be_considering_tax_software/\">surveyed Members</a> about a possible tax filing solution. Maybe it will launch for this tax filing season.</p>\n\n<p>At the start of 2021, SoFi asked for input on which new features to prioritize.
