{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Ok... let me explain.\n\nI briefly worked as an intern in the Hydrogen fuel industry in 2019. This, in turn, led me to invest a good sum of my earnings in Tesla, as I had thought I had a good understanding of the EV industry.\n\nFirst let me explain what solution Hydrogen is the answer to. I firmly believe it is not the answer to energy *production*, but possibly one day for storage. Hydrogen is not found naturally on Earth. It requires loads of energy, typically through hydrolysis (remember high school chemistry?) in order to isolate H2.\n\nSecond, Fuel Cell technology is years and years behind battery technology in recent years.

There are many additional factors that affect fuel cell functionality, such as air quality and temperature. These limitations are much less severe for batteries.\n\nAlso, look at the state of development of the two technologies. EVs are becoming more and more popular every year. Honda and Hyundai each have Hydrogen fuel cells on the market, but you never hear of or see them. Ever see a hydrogen gas refill station? Nope. They barely exist outside of Cali.\n\nNow, I understand much of the idea behind Hydrogen Technology is what's in store for the future, but what about batteries? In what world will we suddenly ditch these very successful batteries that work extremely efficiently today for fuel cells that run on hydrogen that may work well in 20 years?\n\nPreviously I said Hydrogen is not the answer for energy production, but maybe one day storage. Though storage is difficult and a pain in the ass, Hydrogen energy can be stored and shipped in tanks. One day, if we eventually as a country have so much excess energy that we can simply perform hydrolysis on water and store the excess hydrogen in a vat, then hydrogen may be the answer.
