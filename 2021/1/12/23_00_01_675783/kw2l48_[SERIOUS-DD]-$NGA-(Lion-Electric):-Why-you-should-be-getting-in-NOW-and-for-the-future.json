No company outside of 'Murica or China can be of interest right? ***RIGHT????*** Well, the EV credits in Quebec are pretty fucking insane, but other than that you are right.

Lion Electric, in fact, are already [registered as a business](https://michigan-company.com/co/the-lion-electric-co-usa-inc) in Michigan. Oh, and it just so happens that the rumored factory location is right in between two Amazon factories, and is not a mere coincidence (see more below on why this is pertinent).

Seriously, look at how many job listings are posted across America by Lion Electric by clicking [here](https://emploislion.com/en/jobs).\n\n\n\n#*So, why the FUCK should I care?* \n\n\n**Because fucking Jeff Bezos and Joe Biden care, idiot.** \n\n\nNews silently broke last week that **AMAZON** has come to an agreement to purchase up to 500 of Lions class-6 and class-8 delivery trucks per year from 2021-2025 (or up to 2500 over 5 years). Emphasis on 'silently' because this company, unlike many, lets their results do the talking rather than a PR team full of slimy fuckers. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention that Amazon has the option to purchase at least **2500 trucks per year (conservative number), or 1.1b worth** for the five years following 2025, with a possibility of acquiring up to [15.8% of the company](https://stnonline.com/news/school-bus-production-to-benefit-from-amazon-agreement-lion-electric/). \n\n**Yup. Amazon are in bed with Lion Electric, and you should be too.** \n\nAnd, before anyone asks, the Tesla semi-truck serves entirely different purposes. No point in comparing apples to oranges. Tesla's truck is specialized for a single purpose: long distance delivery from warehouse to retail. **The Lion-8 and Lion-6 delivery trucks are much more versatile, will be used by Amazon to deliver between Amazon's facilities, and most importantly they are already ready for MASS SCALE PRODUCTION**. So, no, they are not competing against the Tesla semi and will fill different voids in the market. [See here how diversified their truck lineup really is.](https://imgur.com/nJiXzp8)\n\n#*And what about Joe Biden?* \n\n**Sleepy Joe and his Clean Energy Plan have vowed to [electrify 500,000 school buses](https://thenextweb.com/shift/2020/11/14/what-bidens-environmental-plans-mean-for-electric-vehicles-syndication/) over the next 4 years**\n\nNO COMPANY better positioned to take a huge piece of that pie than Lion Electric. If that seems like a stretch to you, consider this: the CEO of Lion, Marc Bedard, will be speaking at a virtual event on the future of E-mobility this Wednesday (Jan 13), [where the Co-chair of Biden's Infrastructure Committee will be in attendance](https://my.demio.com/ref/vFksZ11nZGvHsaxG). Allow me to show you what the Lion Electric buses look like, and what their clients think of them, highlighted by [this dude](https://youtu.be/StpnGrItO4E?t=46) from California  labelling them as the **Rolls Royce and Tesla of school buses**. \n\nI\u2019m sure many of you will be aware of the merger completed today with Proterra, another electric bus manufacturer. Awesome right? [A real shame that, in their investors presentation, they did not mention Lion in the peer comparison section, as they would've admitted to being second best.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820630/000121390021001584/ea133141ex99-2_arclight.htm?fbclid=IwAR0X17En3iZX-fZhuNAneJG2lDvOX_pT-OcKlXVbKWmnAMFtuNbUsrqA4M0) \n\n\n**Proterra are also exclusively a bus play, while Lion expects nearly 90% of its revenue by 2024 to be from trucks. In fact, Lion's revenue from their trucks ALONE in 2024 is projected to trump Proterra's entire revenue in 2025.**\n\nAnyhow, none of these companies have anywhere near the capacity to electrify 25% of the American school bus fleet by themselves in 4 years. So I assure you that Lion will be shitting out school buses to Biden over the next 4 years, as will Proterra probably, since there are only 3 players that are READY in the industry to be in on this.\n\n\n\n#*Why should I buy RIGHT FUCKING NOW?*\n\n**Because tomorrow may very well be the last chance to get in $NGA under 30$.**\n\nJim Cramer is inviting Marc (the CEO) onto **Mad Money** [TOMORROW](https://i.redd.it/ucl54g5avaa61.jpg) after it was initially scheduled last week, but the events in Washington forced a postponement.
