{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Ok so, today i came across a post on wsb regarding an unusual activity of $ZNGA options in particular for the $10 strike call option expiring January 22, 2021.

Now, before i proceed into any further analysis, there is a 99% probability that what you guys are about to read is complete bs. I tried to come up with a rational explanation for the risky yolo and this is what i came up with.\n\nI was scratching my head for quite some time trying to rationalize why somebody would take such a big risky (besides being a complete retard, which is the most probable outcome). While my wife and her boyfriend were wrestling in the next room, i decided to take a walk so i can clear my head from the noise and try to concentrate on my thoughts. While i was walking and the sun was hitting my face, suddenly, a vision of Papa Elon smiling appeared to me. And then it hit me. Could it be? No, it is impossible! Tesla and Zynga have nothing in common. What does a game developer company have to do with electric vehicles, nothing in common whatsoever. I could not let go of the image of Papa Elon happily smiling at me and so i decided to dwell deeper into the rabbit hole. I started looking up, who were the original founders and investors of Zynga. To my surprise the names of Peter Thiel and  Reid Hoffman popped up, members of the paypal mafia.
