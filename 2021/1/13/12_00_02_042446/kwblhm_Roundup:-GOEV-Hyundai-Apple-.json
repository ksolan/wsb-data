Tim Apple [reportedly met with the BMW i3 team in 2015](https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/31/9081425/apple-bmw-i3-meeting-rumor) to learn about vehicle manufacturing. The report stated Apple \"may be eyeing the i3 as the foundation for its own, heavily rumored electric car.\" Who used to work on the i3? Stefan Krause, Ulrich Kranz, and Richard Kim -- i.e. the team behind the i3 and i8 birthed Canoo into existence.\n2. Canoo's philosophy is much the same as Apple's. They mention several times in their press materials and in their appearance on JLG that they sought to [\"rethink\" the car from the ground up](https://twitter.com/canoo/status/1229937399637139456?s=20).\n3. Canoo moved extremely fast compared to most EV players. They took 19 months to reach beta phase, have completed 50+ crash tests, have 32 beta vehicles, and 13 driving prototypes. Apple would like to see this kind of competence -- heck, any partner would.\n4. One of the few things that Canoo has not improved upon at all in their skateboard is battery tech, which Apple reportedly has in spades with their [reported \"breakthrough\" EV battery technology](https://www.engadget.com/apple-car-2024-233505759.html). What else has Apple been working on non-stop? Another of Canoo's weaknesses -- [autonomous tech with their fleet of Lexus SUVs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-project-titan-to-start-electric-vehicle-production-in-2024-says-reuters/).\n5. Hyundai and Canoo have [an existing engineering partnership to design a skateboard](https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2982) that will underpin \"small, 'cost-competitive' electric vehicles\" for Hyundai. Hyundai believes in Canoo enough to also invest directly in the company.\n6. Apple [is definitely working with Hyundai on securing a manufacturing deal by the end of Q1](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/10/apple-hyundai-apple-car-deal/), according to reports from South Korean media.\n7. Apple [reportedly wants the Apple Car to be \"a personal vehicle\u00a0for the mass market,\"](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/21/apple-targets-car-production-by-2024.html) which fits perfectly with what Canoo is engineering for Hyundai... or a variation thereof. Apple has also [long been rumored](https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/02/21/apple-project-titan-vehicle-could-turn-out-to-be-an-electric-van) to want to make something akin to an \"electric van\" for commuting.\n8. With the news report from The Verge surfacing, in which it's revealed Apple wanted to acquire Canoo, one can pretty easily see what is happening:\n   1. Apple approaches Canoo about an acquisition in January 2020\n   2. Canoo execs/engineers believe in their product too much to sell it. But -- and this is key -- there is no way you say \"no\" to Apple when you're in that bad of a financial situation (as reported in the same article). Maybe they said \"you can invest\", maybe they said \"let's partner,\" but I guaran-damn-tee you they did not tell the most prestigious company in the world to pound sand.\n   3. Backroom dealings happen in secret.... Then Hyundai announces their tie-up with Canoo in February. Did Apple approach Hyundai about approaching Canoo? Did Canoo and Apple jointly come to an agreement to bring a manufacturer in? Did Canoo-Hyundai happen organically to Apple's good fortune? Who knows...\n   4. Whatever happened, now it's reported that Apple hopes to reach a deal with Hyundai by end of March. Why? Because they want Canoo's skateboard tech, of course. They simply found a workaround.\n   5. Canoo-Hyundai-Apple allows each company to bring their incredible strengths to Apple Car. Canoo execs/engineers have 30+ years experience in automotive and the i3 and i8 under their belt; Hyundai have manufacturing at scale down; Apple have design/UX/software/battery tech/autonomous. This is the best possible outcome for Apple. In other words, Apple would probably want Canoo's experience.\n9. If Canoo knows their skateboard is valuable enough for Apple to want it, they surely are going to demand a profit from Hyundai in some way, likely through licensing their patents/tech out. No way they have a strictly engineering and investment agreement. There must be royalties or other fees at play here. Of course, we don't know at the moment because the details are being held close to the chest.\n10. Canoo has stated [in a slide deck](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022607/ea125677ex99-2_hennessy.htm) that their platform is \"fully autonomous compatible.\" \\*wink\\* \\*wink\\*\n11. Canoo stated [in a slide deck](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_270955872.png) that they have interest from a \"Tech Strategic... player in smart car and autonomous vehicle that has identified Canoo as a base platform to integrate systems.\" Sounds a lot like Apple or Uber or something of that ilk.\n12. Canoo has mentioned several times that they have a partnership announcement in Q1 2021. They recently posted \"\ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\ud83d\udd0b\ud83e\udd1d\ud83d\udccd\ud83d\udcf2\" as a tease [on their social accounts](https://twitter.com/canoo/status/1345145017975726080?s=20).\n13. The [reported timeline](https://www.autoblog.com/2021/01/10/apple-car-built-by-hyundai-america/) for Apple car is 2022 (prototype), 2024 (integrate Apple's battery tech). Whose timeline is similar to that? Canoo's. Canoo hopes to launch the Lifestyle Vehicle in 2022 and their MPDV in 2023, with future models in 2024 and beyond.\n14. ADDED: Canoo has designed their Lifestyle Vehicle and MPDV to [be completely screen-free except for your phone or tablet](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-unveils-worlds-first-subscription-only-electric-vehicle).\n15. ADDED: Canoo are currently [advertising 100+ jobs](https://canoo.breezy.hr/) between their Breezy jobs page and LinkedIn.\n\nAll signs point to Apple wanting to acquire Canoo for their technology and Canoo turning down an outright acquisition, so Apple went after Hyundai to back-door access the tech they wanted.\n\nCanoo has (in bold and large lettering) on some investor decks that they \"OWN PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY\" -- probably because they realized how valuable this was after the Apple overture.\n\nWith all that said, even if the Apple tie-up is completely unrelated to Canoo (which seems like a stretch at this point, it's more likely Canoo is involved in some way, imo), it's clear that $GOEV is legit, has valuable, protectable IP, and a team that believes in the product.\n\nMORE obligatory rockets: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nPosition: long GOEV, only 300 shares because I'm poor \ud83d\ude80", "author_fullname": "t2_rdmj6qg", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Roundup: GOEV-Hyundai-Apple \ud83d\ude80", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kwblhm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 66, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 66, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1610526828.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610551529.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Alright guys, newbie here, but I&#39;ma take a swing at this DD stuff.... with $GOEV popping in AH, I thought I&#39;d sum up why it makes sense that Canoo is likely to be profiting bigly off this Apple-Hyundai tie-up, despite the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev\">The Verge is reporting talks fell through on an acquisition.</a></p>\n\n<p>I had predicted (among friends only), that Canoo&#39;s skateboard and designs lent themselves perfectly to $AAPL, so I (at least purport to) have some legitimacy on this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some of this has already been covered,</strong> but I wanted to take the bajillions of threads on this thing and distill them into one with most of the info. <strong>Sorry if you have $GOEV fatigue, and I don&#39;t blame you...</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here goes.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Tim Apple <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/31/9081425/apple-bmw-i3-meeting-rumor\">reportedly met with the BMW i3 team in 2015</a> to learn about vehicle manufacturing.
