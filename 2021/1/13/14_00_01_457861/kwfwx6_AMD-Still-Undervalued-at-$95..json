{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "AMD is reporting their Q4 2020 results on the 26th (estimated). As a long-term investor and given all the events in the past months I believe AMD is still undervalued at $95.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Intel struggles**\n\nAs is known, Intel has been struggling to keep up with AMD when it comes to the CPU market. Intel is reporting their Q4 on the 21th. There is a chance that they announce any kind of further delays in their 7nm or an even weaker outlook than expected. This has been reinforced by the fact that Intel\u2019s CES presentation was disappointing to many. This could obviously be beneficial to AMD in the runup to their earnings. AMD popped 12% on Intel Q2 report when they first announced their delays. We could get a glimpse off production capacities (and issues) tomorrow when TSMC FY report comes out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**AMD Q4 and FY**\n\nEPS Q4 consensus estimate is 0.47 with a range between 0.43 to 0.58. I believe revenue will be higher than expected, mainly due to the huge demand in the console market (PS5/Xbox) but also the PC/notebook market in general since half of the world was in (semi) lockdown for some parts of Q3/Q4. The main thing I am hoping for is that profit margin stays (roughly) the same at 44%, even though margins on consoles are very thin. If they manage to maintain a margin above 40%, EPS could end up 0.55, which would be a 360% increase with respect to Q4 2019 and 280% year on year. That would be very impressive, given the fact that AMD is considered to still be in their growth stage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2021&2022 Outlook**\n\nBut the main thing to look out for is the guidance for the coming years. Given the continuing lockdowns, the fact that all the market segments they are in (consoles/PC\u2019s/laptops/servers) are booming and the fact that they have GPU\u2019s that can go head to head with NVDA\u2019s I think they could raise their outlook for the coming year as well as 2022. Especially when the Xilinx merger falls trough and they have an increased TAM (total Accessible Market). Estimated EPS for the coming years are 1.83 and 2.42 but with all the mentioned headwinds EPS targets of 2.00+ and 2.75 are not crazy. This would imply P/E\u2019s off 34 for 2022 which is lower than ASML\u2019s for example (50). Hence a stock price of 105-115 is a fair target in the short term and 137,50-145 as a long-term target.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Booming Market**\n\nFinally, we have been in the biggest bull market in a long time, mainly driven by central bank money. Biden is planning a 2.8T stimulus package in the coming weeks. The rising tide has lifted all boats, leading to insane PE valuations across the markets (Lemonade trading at 150x FORWARD P/E for example). A forward PE of 34 for AMD is a way better bet in my opinion.\n\ntl;dr: Buy AMD before we go 100+ \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nPosition:\n\n2750 shares, 5000 LT warrants, 200 29Jan\u201921 100Calls.", "author_fullname": "t2_14tsh9qh", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "AMD Still Undervalued at $95.", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_kwfwx6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610571430.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>AMD is reporting their Q4 2020 results on the 26th (estimated).
