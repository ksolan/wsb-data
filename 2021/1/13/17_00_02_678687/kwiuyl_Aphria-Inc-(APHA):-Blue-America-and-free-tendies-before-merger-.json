{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "This is a follow-up post to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kn4wck/aphria_inc_apha_yes_its_cannabis_yes_its_about_to/) I made two weeks ago which was an update to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k450e6/why_apha_is_set_for_a_50_gain/) by  [u/WatAb0utB0b](https://www.reddit.com/user/WatAb0utB0b/) a month ago. I suggest reading those before reading this post.\n\n# Introduction: a look back over two weeks\n\nPeople called me a bagholder, a shill, a clown... People said weed stocks sucked and one guy even told me to buy an Xbox instead... Others clowned on me for owning only 30 shares (i'm a poor student stfu)... Well look at APHA now, it was below $7 when I posted the DD and now it's above $9.6. If you retards listened to me you would have had at least a 35% gain in two weeks. My -20% loss has turned into a 10%  gain. Of course this was because of the democratic victory in Georgia which defied analysts' predictions. Like usual, cannabis stock posts start popping up here *after* the price jump (bandwagon andy's). A lot of them are missing crucial information in their DD's, so I hope you will listen to me now on why Aphria is the ultimate cannabis pick.\n\n# Democrats control everything\n\nThe cannabis industry will become unstoppable in the next four years. The price jump sinds the democratic victory is only the beginning. Daddy Biden will decriminalize it over the entire U.S.A. This thursday Biden will make his first plans as a president clear, mainly around the stimulus plans for you Amerifats. He might mention policy too, if he does mention the cannabis industry in anyway: expect another major price jump. Another date to look out for is the Biden inauguration on the 20th of this month, expect another price jump then as he will 100% mention the decriminalisation of cannabis there.\n\nI'm not a political expert as I'm an Europoor retard, but I've been reading in and the democrats basically have a majority in every important political institution. This means they can pass everything they want. Cannabis decriminalisation should be at the top of their agenda as it has been mentioned in political discourse for years now. For the long term, there's no way that cannabis stock prices don't reach the same heights as 2017/2018 in the next four years. You should have cannabis in your portfolio if you don't hate money. After Biden's administration, it will be a pain in the ass for a Republican leader to totally re-criminalize it as the entire economy and justice system will have adapted already. So this can be a short or long term hold, just depends on how good you are at diamond handing.\n\n# Arbitrage (free tendies) because of APHA/TLRY merger\n\nHowever, I still see autists in daily threads and DD's disrespecting Aphria, telling you that Tilray is the obvious better pick. TLRY has indeed been growing more profoundly than APHA, but I think there's something you guys don't understand about the merger. I repeat from my last post, about Tilray and Apha's merger: \"They will form under Tilray's ticker, but Aphria stock owners will get a 62% stake in Tilray while current Tilray owners will keep a 38% stake.\" I don't think you guys realized what that means, quote from merger announcement: **\"Aphria shareholders will receive 0.8381 Tilray shares for each Aphria share they own, while Tilray shareholders will see no adjustment to their holdings.\"**\n\nWhat this means is that the price of APHA should logically be 0.8381 times the TLRY share price. Aphria Inc's share price only matters relative to Tilray's price if held until merger. I'll spell it out for you retards. As of right now, APHA is noted at $9.76 and TLRY at $14.56. The ratio of APHA to TLRY is 0.6703, far from the 0.8381 split that will happen at merger in the second quarter of this year. That's a difference of 0.1678 Tilray shares that you get on top of what you actually should be getting.\n\n**What this means is if you buy in now, it's literally an arbitrage opportunity/free tendies at merger.** **By buying Aphria stock, you're indirectly buying Tilray at a discount.** From the point you buy in, it doesn't matter how APHA's price evolves as long as you hold until merger: you should only look at Tilray's price. Compare your cost per share with Tilray's share price, if Tilray keeps growing you'll only get more value at merger. The only possible risks are: the merger doesn't go through, one of the companies goes bankrupt or if somehow Tilray price falls badly and your cost per share to Tilray's price is suddenly above 0.8381. Chances of either of those events occurring are nihil.\n\n# TLDR:\n\nOn top of all the reasons mentioned in previous posts, the cannabis industry is more likely to boom short and long term than ever. American political developments are crucial and in favor of the cannabis industry. The reason Aphria is the best pick as an investor is because of its merger with Tilray. They will form the second largest cannabis company on the stock market under TLRY's ticker and APHA holders will get 0.8381 Tilray shares for each of their APHA shares. Currently APHA is valued below that split. This means that if you buy APHA and hold until merger in Q2 of 2021, APHA's price evolution doesn't matter because you basically buy Tilray at a discount (=free tendies).\n\nEDIT: I don't know what happens to APHA calls at merger guys, if someone can clear that up I'll add it to the post.
