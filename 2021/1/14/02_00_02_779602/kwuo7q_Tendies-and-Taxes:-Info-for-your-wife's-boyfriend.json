{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Sup fellow degenerates? Are you curious about how the government is going to steal your tendies or, more likely, if all of the losses from your degenerate yolo trades can actually help you at all? Well lucky for you, Papa is here to provide a basic overview of the tax process in FAQ style. Fair warning, no DD here and there will be a *TL;DR* so you can now scroll and ignore my labor of love. *This is 100% not legal advice and is intended for general educational purposes.*\n\n***Section One: For those with tendies***\n\n**Q: What is tax?**\n\n**A:** Google it.\n\n**Q: What types of tax are associated with stonks?**\n\n**A:** While not an inclusive list, the traditional tax types you will run into will be: 1. Long Term Capital Gains (\u201cLTCG\u201d); 2. Short Term Capital Gains (\u201cSTCG\u201d); 3. Long Term Capital Loss (\u201cLTCL\u201d); 4. Short Term Capital Loss (\u201cSTCL\u201d) (*applicable to 99% of you*); and 5. Dividend tax treatment.\n\n**Q: What is the difference between long term or short term?**\n\n**A:** Gain/Loss is long term verses short term based on, you guessed it, the duration of time you owned the qualifying investment. Over twelve (12) months is long term and under twelve (12) months is short term.\n\n**Q: Is my option long term or short-term gain/loss?**\n\n**A:** You most likely trade FDs, it\u2019s short term. \\* Semi-joke, but unless you owned the option for over 12 months, *e.g.*, leaps, then it is short term.\n\n**Q: Why does long term v short term matter?**\n\n**A:** Simply put, long term gain receives more favorable tax treatment as policy rewards longer term investments. While LTCG is tax at 0-20% effective rate based on your individual income, STCG is treated as ordinary income and is taxed at whatever your effective rate is. Therefore, it is at a great advantage of someone with either large amount of gain (no one here) or high income (also no one here) to hold investments longer to receive LTCG tax treatment.\n\n**Q: How do dividends factor into this?**\n\n**A:** Depends, if your also invested into stonk occasionally certain stonk will pay out dividend payments. These dividends are either \u201cqualified\u201d or \u201cordinary\u201d dividends. Without going in-depth into the corporate tax law, \u201cqualified\u201d dividends are treated at LTCG rate whereas ordinary dividends are treated as STCG = ordinary income.\n\n***Section Two: For those without tendies***\n\n**Q: I fucked up; can these losses be used for anything?**\n\n**A:** Thankfully the tax code knew people like us would inevitably try our hand at white collar gambling, and, unlike our degenerate sports betting cousins, the tax code has tax benefits for losses the first question is: do I have a net loss and, if yes, is my loss short term or long term? If you do have copious losses, good news they are deductible but there are limits.\n\n**Q: Ok, obviously I have losses\u2026 how do I deduct them?**\n\n**A:** Losses on your investments are first used to\u00a0offset capital gains\u00a0of the same type. So, short-term losses are first deducted against short-term gains, and long-term losses are deducted against long-term gains. Net losses of either type can then be deducted against the other kind of gain. And finally, if you have more losses than total gain, you can utilize the losses deduct up to $3,000 of ordinary income per year.\n\n**Q: Bro, I yolo\u2019ed and have way more than $3,000 of losses, what now?**\n\n**A:** Luckily, or unluckily, you are allowed to carry forward the losses indefinitely utilizing $3,000 each future tax year until you\u2019ve expended the loss.\n\n**Q: What if I still have questions or need help with some other legal matter?**\n\n**A:** You should consult with a professional \\*cough cough\\*\n\n*TL;DR* **File your taxes and consult with tax professionals**. I represent taxpayers across the country before the IRS and several northeastern state tax authorities and would like to see as many of you avoid dealing with them.\n\nSource References: See Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7\u202f 1222; 1211; 1212; 316; etc. and please consult with tax and legal professionals.\n\nThe above is intended to provide generalized financial information designed to educate a broad segment of the public; it does not give personalized tax, investment, legal, or other business and professional advice.
