{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**GameStop short squeeze is ON! Alibaba continues to push into the EV world. Intel spikes while AMD & TSM suffer. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news!**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market finishing mixed, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/qybhmjC) gaining .43%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YL4XS6m) also gaining .23% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/YTFwLcx) lost just 8 points to close out the day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/0r28dsT) dropping almost 5% again, continuing the downtrend after that huge spike with the Georgia elections, as it sits at similar levels to the ones before Christmas.\n\nDespite the positive gains for the broad stock market SP500, [OVERALL](https://ibb.co/PrDh7DD), we saw about 57% of the companies declining yesterday, with most of them trading below average volumes, as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average still sits over 70%, which is pretty high. Yesterday we saw 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/wJH4B8C) finish in the green with Real Estate and Utilities posting gains of more than 1% while the laggards were Energy, Industrials and Materials, as we saw large-cap growth companies finally [OUTPERFORMED](https://ibb.co/kKtRY96) for once in 2021, with small & mid-caps giving up some of the big gains they have posted in this short year, though, Large-Cap Growth companies are still underperforming by 3% compared to the next factor group in 2021.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Ms0qkCh) from yesterday, which shows pretty mixed results as expected, with most of the big tech companies posting small gains like Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix and the rest of the bunch, with Alibaba posting a 4% gain after some EV news popped up and Intel also gaining almost 7% and pushed the rest of the Semiconductors down with TSM and AMD both down over 3%.\n\nWe also got a lot of economic data yesterday as the US [DEFICIT](https://ibb.co/QXXDBrc) fell by $2B to $143B in December compared to the previous month, but is up 10 fold from the $13B deficit from the same period in 2019, and this doesn\u2019t even include any of the $900B stimulus packaged that passed late in December, while the December consumer price [INDEX](https://ibb.co/n1Jr9G2) increased by 0.4% m/m and Core CPI also increase by 0.1%, coming in-line with expectations, as the Atlanta FED business inflation expectations [ROSE](https://ibb.co/t2v98jw) to 2.2% in January compared to December, though sales and profit margins compared to normal, decreased since the last month, while one of the FED\u2019s Vice Chairs [RESTATED](https://ibb.co/WtNxQKM) that the FED won\u2019t raise rates until the average long-term inflation stands at 2% for a year.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/C79879d) we get lots of important economic data with Jobless numbers in the early morning, which are expected to come around the same numbers as the previous week and end with the Money Supply and FED Balance Sheet while the stock market will also turn its eyes to see what the FED Leader Powell announces in terms of the FED keeping the money printer going, and of course to see what Biden announces about a further stimulus packaged that is expected to be as big as $2T.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/9bHNxrx) spiking yesterday after the company decided on a change in leadership, this move put some selling pressure on rival companies like TSM, AMD & others, but I think this is more of a \u201chype move\u201d right now. Intel has still fallen behind it\u2019s competition and it will take massive Capex and R&D investments to catch up, so the selloff in other players should rather be a buying point, especially for AMD.\n\nWe also saw [Target](https://ibb.co/Phk4N4s) reporting huge comp sale increases with a 4.3% increase in traffic and a massive 12.3% increase in the average ticket, as comparable digital sales more than doubled. \n\nWe also saw, their same-day services post an impressive growth of almost 200%, as they remain one of the best plays in the consumer discretionary sector, as 95% of their sales were fulfilled by their 1600 store that are within 10miles of \u00be of the US population.\n\nAlso, guys, these small cap companies keep on giving me reasons to come back to the same points I have been making in the past weeks, with company after company issuing shares, with the latest ones being [Nano](https://ibb.co/qDRKJ7Y) Dimension which are diluting their shares by about 20% while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/27StT0c) has also increased their stock offering by another 300.000 shares.\n\nWhile in another kind of news we saw [GameStop](https://ibb.co/pLMSXrb) soar yesterday finishing the day up over 57%, after a huge short squeeze pushed the stock up as high as 90% at one point. This has happened after GameStop has [PUSHED](https://ibb.co/F3S2XTT) for a change in leadership with plenty of experience in the e-commerce and online marketing world, with 3 veterans from Chewy, which has been an impressive performer in the online e-commerce business. The [STOCK](https://ibb.co/y8XVnd7)  Is up another 20% in pre-market right now as the short squeeze keeps increasing the pressure on the bears.\n\nWe also saw [Alibaba](https://ibb.co/vjKdwKW) making a couple of headlines yesterday, which helped push the stocks 4% higher, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US is expected to continue to allow investments in Alibaba, Baidu & Tencent, while also continuing their charge into the [EV](https://ibb.co/0tVsJSS) world, with a new electric sedan that features wireless charging in cooperation with China\u2019s state owned SAIC Motor. This is their latest push into the EV world, as Alibaba is also an investor in Xpeng. This news, might help the stock see a recovery, that could be boosted if Jack Ma finally appears and the Ant Group IPO eventually receives the green light.\n\nAnd one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Z8RSWQL) is that Affirm went public yesterday and started trading at just over 90$, more than 80% above the IPO price, as the IPO mania keeps on pushing any recent IPO to big pops on the first day of trading, but unfortunately, retail investors do not benefit from this, as the actual return for people who manage to buy right at the open price, is under 10% while also risking a severe drop in the next days. Hopefully more companies will move to direct listings IPOs which will allow retail investors to get part of the action, which will benefit most of the people, not just the \u201cbig players\u201d who get in at much lower prices.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/T8wRNxc) Markets are in the green while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/LkrrWtc) are also pointing to a good open.\n\n \ud83d\ude4fThank you everyone for reading!\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!
