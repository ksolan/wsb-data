Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-14-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Wall Street looks to start another mixed session\n\n> * Dow and S&P 500 futures rose but Nasdaq futures dipped slightly Thursday, a day after a mixed session left all three stock benchmarks less than 1% from their record highs. Shortly after Wednesday\u2019s market close, the House impeached President Donald Trump for inciting an insurrection at the Capitol last week. Premarket stock reaction was relatively muted because the House vote was widely expected.\n\n> * Investors will also focus on the Labor Department\u2019s weekly jobless claims data at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are calling for a rise to 800,000 in weekly new filings for unemployment benefits.\n\n> * Delta Air Lines cut in half its cash burn and narrowed its losses in the fourth quarter as the coronavirus pandemic drove the carrier to its worst year ever. Shares in the premarket rose more than 1%.\n\n> * Shares of BlackRock were higher by more than 1% Thursday after the New York-based firm reported better-than-expected profits and revenue in the fourth quarter. BlackRock\u2019s assets under management surged to a record $8.68 trillion at the conclusion of the quarter.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. 10 Republicans vote for Trump impeachment\n\n> * Ten Republicans joined all of the House Democrats in a 232-197 vote to impeach Trump. GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell, majority leader until Georgia certifies the Democrats\u2019 two runoff election wins, said the Senate won\u2019t start Trump\u2019s trial until Tuesday. That\u2019s one day before President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration, which is expected to be locked down with unprecedented security. In a video released Wednesday, Trump sent his clearest condemnation yet of last week\u2019s Capitol riot. However, he took no responsibility and made no mention of impeachment.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Biden to unveil Covid mitigation plan\n\n> * Biden is expected to unveil Thursday a coronavirus action plan, centering on a mass vaccination program and closer coordination among all levels of government. The Biden plan comes as the U.S. battles another surge in Covid cases and deaths.\n\n> * Mainland China on Thursday reported its first Covid death since May as authorities try to control a spike in cases just outside of Beijing. The flare-up unfolds as a WHO team arrives in Wuhan, where the coronavirus was discovered in late 2019, to investigate the origins of the virus alongside Chinese scientists.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. J&J\u2019s one-shot coronavirus vaccine safe: Study\n\n> * Johnson & Johnson\u2019s one-dose Covid vaccine is safe and appears to generate a promising immune response in young and elderly volunteers, according to trial data published in the New England Journal of Medicine. J&J is expected to release results from its 45,000-person phase three trial later this month, which could then lead to a third vaccine approved for emergency use in the U.S. by the FDA. J&J is using the same technologies behind its Ebola vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna employed a new approach for their respective two-shot vaccines.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. Petco, Poshmark set to debut on Nasdaq\n\n> * Two initial public offering are debuting on the Nasdaq on Thursday. Petco priced its IPO at $18 per share, above the expected range of $14 to $17, valuing the pet products retailer at nearly $4 billion. Poshmark priced its IPO at $42 per share, above the expected range of $35 to $39. The offering gives the online secondhand goods seller an initial valuation of more than $3 billion.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/BRd9Yd4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MS8vXxs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/kxhhvOm.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mRvY2KC.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/Dr7cIXH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/fuVlrhi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/nM5oV77.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/xVZMg74.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DTmidUm.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Z39U4RB.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/duiiAuN.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/wsMxjtf.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/xSJAWwz.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-gamestop-tesla-nordstrom-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **GameStop (GME)** \u2013 GameStop is jumping once again in premarket trading after surging the past three days in what some analysts are calling a short squeeze.
