{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "GPRO has had some recent momentum but it's about to be the bigger turnaround  story of 2021. Some people were asking why and so I\u2019m sharing my  compelling case why they will not only crush their upcoming Q4 earnings,  but also establish a record turnaround with consecutive quarter  profitability, hype, and \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b  getting short squeezed.  No excessive  rocket emojis, no edgy lingo trying to be \"one of the gang\", just some  solid DD:\n\n**Summary**\n\n* Revenue for **Q3 2020 exploded to $281 million, +109% QoQ from $134 million in Q2 2020**.   With record ecommerce industry sales in 2020 and Q4, GoPro\u2019s already  successful direct-to-consumer pivot, and new subscription income  channel, I expect them to hit new Q4 revenue and profit records  exceeding their $565.94 million recorded from Q4 2019. Oh and add a  short squeeze on top\n* Subscribers to their paid subscription program **passed 670k, up 35% QoQ and 65% YoY**.  Based on growth rate, it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll hit 1 MILLION before end of  Q1. I explain below why there is so much momentum and goodness that will  come from this\n* They were **PROFITABLE in Q3 and CRUSHED expectations**,  beating Non-GAAP EPS of $0.20 beats by $0.14 and GAAP EPS of $0.02  beats by $0.09. GAAP gross margin for Q3 2020 was 35.4%, up from 21.7%  year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q3 2020 was 36.2%, up from  23.4% year-over-year.\n* Not only were they profitable, but they reduced non-GAAP operating expenses by $90m, -9% YoY, and reduced **a whopping 25% year-over-year**.  We should expect to see more efficiencies in Q4\n* GPRO is flush with $147 million in cash and investments, that\u2019s **up to +85% YoY**!!\n\nAnd now they\u2019re likely about to post record-breaking profitable Q4 earnings. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Q4 Monster Earnings is Likely**\n\n**Successful Direct-to-Consumer Pivot -**  2020 has been a record year for all ecommerce, and GoPro has already  shown a successful pivot from big box retailers to growing their own  direct-to-consumer online programs, saving margin by selling directly  from their own website without needing to pay commission.  GoPro's  direct business has grown more profitable in recent years with millions  of unique visitors each month and in 2019 it was already generating more  than 20% of revenue in top European markets and nearly 20% in the  United States. The Covid pivot of 2020 has likely pumped those rookie  numbers up.\n\n**Q4 Will Confirm a Profitable Trend -**  GoPro hasn't had two consecutive profitable quarters in five years.  Typically, it reaches profitability with a new camera launch. Last year,  the company launched their H8 camera in the fourth quarter. This year, it  launched the H9 camera in the third quarter and we know they saw record  Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. I am AMPED that Q4 results will  confirm the turnaround trend.\n\n**Covid, Vaccine, &amp; Seasonal Goodness**  \u2013 Covid has been a blessing in disguise for GoPro due to lockdowns  pushing people outdoors, the perfect use case for their action camera  segment. In 2021 we will continue to see more goodness for 3 reasons: 1)  as vaccine rollout expands, in-store retail purchases will likely  climb, reviving a major revenue channel, 2) coming spring/outdoors  season will likely increase more sales, driven by pent up demand for  post-lockdown travel, 3) You can buy like 5 cameras with Buyden\u2019s  2k stimis\n\n2. **Consumer Brand to Tech Company - Profitable Cloud Storage Subscription Service**\n\nLast  quarter was a record quarter for GoPro\u2019s subscription program,  essentially a cloud storage service. If you didn\u2019t know, in 2020 GoPro  launched a new subscription service for \\~$5/month that includes  unlimited video storage in the cloud, discounts on accessories, and a  device warranty. It\u2019s since turned into fast growing revenue and profit  channel. Regardless of where consumers purchase, GoPro now owns the  post-purchase customer relationship with its subscribers and is driving  repeat purchases and revenue through member-only discount programs and  monthly storage fees, increasing the lifetime value of every purchasing  customer. The subscription program has only accelerated, pushing past  670,000 subscribers from record Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales,  meaning more customers than ever that are providing greater returns than  ever. Based on 2020 growth rates, I have a hunch they\u2019ll announce a new  subscription milestone between 750k or past 1m by feb earnings announce  and start seeing real bottom line impact from their cloud storage  service.\n\n3. **Short Squeeze Likely**\n\nThe  current short interest ratio is near historic highs at 15%, and while  not GME level high, there are \\~16m shorted shares at a volume of $147m,  the highest in at least 2 years. The increased buy volume ahead of  expected earnings + what I expect will be a downright righteous Q4 beat  will be a catalyst to push the price as bears buy back to cut their  losses.\n\n**Target and Positions**\n\nEarnings  is likely 2/3 and I can see it confidently reaching 11 or as high as 15  from a milestone Q4 beat and turnaround. I think positive momentum  could push it as high as 18-20 by May if they can pull a profitable  trifecta. Personally I have mostly shares plus some 2/5 11c and 4/16 9c  &amp; 15c, which seem to have the best available volume and open  interest, though like GME shares are my long term play.\n\nThere  are probably some good counter arguments why I'm retarded, but GoPro  makes solid products,  record profits, and is evolving into a true Tech  company with it's cloud service &amp; GoPro Labs\n\nEdit: adding excessive \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 per request", "author_fullname": "t2_yoi8u", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "[Serious DD] GoPro is About to Be The Next Turnaround Story and Short Squeeze", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_kx6s1x", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 30, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 30, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1610635825.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610663742.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>GPRO has had some recent momentum but it&#39;s about to be the bigger turnaround  story of 2021.
