{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Hello brothers and sisters in GameStop. My sermon today is an examination of why some of our fellow autists have become millionaires while I continue to live in a cardboard box. \n\nI was an early-ish follower of the $GME faith, but when tribulations came my faith was shaken. I still went to church, but my heart wasn't in it like those we look up to. We must reflect on our failures to grow as followers in Cohen. \n\nThis testimony is long (sorry). I needed to force myself to actually examine things so I don't fuck up the next opportunity for tendies. This is my penance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**: Retard examining why I made small gains off $GME despite being in months ago. I keep track of all my trades. $GME has been a rollercoaster of emotions and opportunities in a very short time, so lots to learn. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Takeaways\n\n1. I never truly committed or believed in the position. It remained a small % of my portfolio and I was always hedging because being down even a couple % hurt, let alone -20% swings. To find 20X return you have to invest in companies that have significant uncertainty (and volatility). That  means persuasive arguments on both sides. If you lack conviction you won't be able to stay in.  \n2. Follow those charts and imagine you don't know where we end up. Put yourself in that moment. Holy fuck. **Am I buying the dip or catching a falling knife**? This has been bumpy and uncertain. We can all pretend this was a sure thing, it wasn't. It still isn't.\n3. We've all heard Fear and Greed rule the market. Its one thing to say that. Its another to feel it and observe it in yourself. My mood on $GME has flipped from \"This motherfucking boomer CEO is burning all my $\" to \"Fat FIRE, this year, motherfuckers\" 4 times in as many months. I felt intense emotions (still feeling them during the current run). W/o acclimating to balance that out I think its impossible to make good decisions. \n4. I'm very glad I kept detailed notes on what I was doing. Write down your thoughts and reason for taking a position. Revisit these. We're all retards. But that doesn't mean we can't learn our bad habits and improve. I'm stunned looking back by how often I was paralyzed and couldn't take action. \n5. None of this was obvious. There were strong cases that the business was undervalued. It was a good bet. But it was a bet. (Blasphemy you say? The true prophet, RoaringKitty said on yesterday's stream that as June turned into July and August and no PE firm or other investors stepped in he began to wonder if he was right). The business was bleeding cash, it just wasn't hemorrhaging like bears thought. The management is out of touch. COVID could have been worse. The broader market could have sold off, offsetting anything $GME did (and probably making sentiment even worse). \n6. I believe at $30-$40 the core business is reasonably priced and the value thesis is proved out. There are other stories (short squeeze and the business transformation) that remain. IMO these are far less certain, but in this market a good story might be worth $100. \n\n# Charts + comments\n\n[Entering via CCPs](https://preview.redd.it/kyuu2rh4rab61.png?width=2769&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ce9dc1dc310e756ff294b88061557fad2726a50)\n\nI hear about $GME. The business model of buy kids consoles for pennies on the dollar seems lucrative, video game sales in general are good, but COVID + things going digital are big question marks. The stock is up a lot from lows, but only liars buy at the low and sell at the high. Still seems reasonable, I sold weekly $10P (felt good about this).  Put premiums were good (3.6% for 3 days) and I figured I could get write for a couple weeks before being assigned. \n\nAlso, picked up some 1/15/21 $30C (retard FOMO, I even noted as much \"Getting in w/o doing full research based on Burry and Ryan Cohen + extremely high short interest. Very speculative at this point. Console refresh upcoming + GME while not vibrant is healthy balance sheet wise\").\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Assigned... Ok, time to wheel](https://preview.redd.it/8746byjkrab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=c210980355934995c97ea8151066f07a9d449b48)\n\nAssigned on the first set of Puts. Fuck. Down 3-ish%. No worries, I'll collect more of that sweet premium w/ CCs at $10. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MSFT News hits](https://preview.redd.it/8x1iv0kesab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=791ec4aec2a3929bc6622a3427539f11c6a0c42a)\n\nMSFT news released. No real details. Some people are mocking it saying it is just an agreement to buy MSFT products. Yeah, that's one way to read it. (We're 3 months past this date and still don't know the specifics...). Missed a 40% jump that settled around 20%. The wheel gave me a 7% return instead. $30C bounced up. Continue to do option writing strategies (purchasing for CCs or near the money Puts). Unsure whether I'm being an idiot and should just go long, but things feel speculative and I like the idea of generating returns now (even lower) to buffer against the downside. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3jtvwmdgtab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=be9dea874271eef7c638f105e7d4d85603836579\n\nWe rocket again! Can't even remember their being news. Shorts are getting squeezed for sure. I'm missing out.  I buy 1000 shares at $15.06. I kind of feel retarded so I hedge it by selling CCs against half the position. Weekly at first, but then $16C 6 weeks out. \n\n$30C still have massive bid/ask spreads but have gone up nicely (150%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d11ov8twuab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=c822ab096d7312bde938adfac6de41ed6ffe2b16\n\nJesus fucking Christ. So glad I sold those longer dated CC, but still took a bath. Really wondering if I'm just an idiot buying in at the top. I also really start considering longer dated $10 Puts (20% for 2 months was available), but pussy out. \n\nI dump the $30C as well on the way down ($1k profit off a $1k position)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1lkmd59vab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=123b123f3eecde3f236e7d29db7f716b1c65cc4a\n\nCohen sends a letter to the board. Market doesn't seem to care. The embarrassment of holding GameStop grows in me. I do a bit of buying to sell ATM CC's. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwv65lwqvab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bad068ef1a0d5780545dbc580737a45d774008e\n\nShit runs up again. Intense FOMO. Feeling like an idiot for not buying when things went back to \\~10. I'm doing the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do. A week ago I thought $GME was shit. Now I want to back up the truck... I held off buying at $13 (It'll pull back), $14, $15 (c'mon). I finally buy at 500 shares @ $16.01, 300 shares at $17.22, 700 more at $19.10. Watching this run up while holding a small position is ruining my Thanksgiving holiday...\n\nFeeling like a sucker I hedge w/ CC's. IV is thru the roof going into the Earnings call. I expect some detail on the MSFT deal. Hopefully the terms they got were good. Ideally they talk about similar deals w/ Sony and Nintendo (They got Reggie on the board, that's got to be a layup, right?). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sherman gives a terrible CC](https://preview.redd.it/o8xq3fmiwab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d93203eea9a8e1a1ed17f6087cffaa7f22e3dd9)\n\nJesus. The numbers weren't that bad, but it'd be hard to shit the bed more if he tried. \n\n\\- No earnings guidance\n\n\\- No partnership deal details\n\n\\- $100M in possible share dilution via a Shelf offering. \n\n\\- No discussion of Cohen or other large holders who have presented suggestions for a turnaround (but we got \"Omnichannel\" boys!)\n\nI go from feeling like a moron for not having more to feeling dumb for holding any of this POS. How is this stock going to go up when the management has its head up its ass? I'm fucked. Holiday #s are the next big news item and these idiots will downplay them. Fuck. FUCK!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cohen ups to 13.1&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/ubwu5lkbyab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffb32464ea1644732caba3752a03921d2cc1a55a)\n\nThere was serious talk of Cohen walking away. He had a low enough cost basis to make a good profit.  He re-affirms and ups his share. \ud83d\ude80 back on the menu. Why don't I have more of this? I missed another golden opportunity...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Random drop](https://preview.redd.it/u398ihwbzab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce4aa76f4c7b0fb3dd3cd19cb6b7a14fb81f8de5)\n\nI sold some CCPs near the top, pretty far out of the money. Would have been assigned at $18. Instead, I close the position for a small profit on the premium, don't want to up my $GME holdings. Already feels like too much exposure. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Yesterday](https://preview.redd.it/4x2txed31bb61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d3202709646cdffdf214d4747df21903d128db7)\n\nCohen and the board were added Monday. Mild move up (10%). TBH I'd barely processed that news when the 60%+ day occurred. \n\nI had 1500 shares w/ only 3 CC's written against them. Proceeded to sell CC's (8 contracts) at $25, $26, $29. I was expecting the move to stop at 15-30%. Obviously misjudged that but that's been my experience. I also really wanted to do the smart thing for once and take profits (relax, not selling shares, just writing contracts) on the upswing vs my normal retarded MO of buying high hoping to sell higher. \n\nWas eye-balling selling the $40C when it hit 600IV ($6 premium for 3 days...), but by that point I was so gunshy (every call I'd written to that point was blown by) and convinced this was going to infinity. I'm resisting the urge to buy, but its hard. Instead I sold some CCP's at $15k worth of $25 (4% return over 3 days). Those 1/15/21 $30C, even w/ massive theta decay, are selling for 3X what I got. \n\nAs confident as the market re-affirming my beliefs makes me $GME still isn't turning a profit yet. Details around the turnaround are scarce. I'll ride it up since my cost-basis is much lower, but I think I missed the opportunity for obscene gains.", "author_fullname": "t2_k0xmj", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0,

My sermon today is an examination of why some of our fellow autists have become millionaires while I continue to live in a cardboard box. </p>\n\n<p>I was an early-ish follower of the $GME faith, but when tribulations came my faith was shaken. I still went to church, but my heart wasn&#39;t in it like those we look up to. We must reflect on our failures to grow as followers in Cohen. </p>\n\n<p>This testimony is long (sorry). I needed to force myself to actually examine things so I don&#39;t fuck up the next opportunity for tendies. This is my penance.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Retard examining why I made small gains off $GME despite being in months ago. I keep track of all my trades. $GME has been a rollercoaster of emotions and opportunities in a very short time, so lots to learn. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Takeaways</h1>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I never truly committed or believed in the position. It remained a small % of my portfolio and I was always hedging because being down even a couple % hurt, let alone -20% swings. To find 20X return you have to invest in companies that have significant uncertainty (and volatility). That  means persuasive arguments on both sides. If you lack conviction you won&#39;t be able to stay in.<br/></li>\n<li>Follow those charts and imagine you don&#39;t know where we end up. Put yourself in that moment. Holy fuck. <strong>Am I buying the dip or catching a falling knife</strong>? This has been bumpy and uncertain. We can all pretend this was a sure thing, it wasn&#39;t. It still isn&#39;t.</li>\n<li>We&#39;ve all heard Fear and Greed rule the market. Its one thing to say that. Its another to feel it and observe it in yourself. My mood on $GME has flipped from &quot;This motherfucking boomer CEO is burning all my $&quot; to &quot;Fat FIRE, this year, motherfuckers&quot; 4 times in as many months. I felt intense emotions (still feeling them during the current run). W/o acclimating to balance that out I think its impossible to make good decisions. </li>\n<li>I&#39;m very glad I kept detailed notes on what I was doing. Write down your thoughts and reason for taking a position. Revisit these. We&#39;re all retards. But that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t learn our bad habits and improve. I&#39;m stunned looking back by how often I was paralyzed and couldn&#39;t take action. </li>\n<li>None of this was obvious. There were strong cases that the business was undervalued. It was a good bet. But it was a bet. (Blasphemy you say? The true prophet, RoaringKitty said on yesterday&#39;s stream that as June turned into July and August and no PE firm or other investors stepped in he began to wonder if he was right). The business was bleeding cash, it just wasn&#39;t hemorrhaging like bears thought. The management is out of touch. COVID could have been worse. The broader market could have sold off, offsetting anything $GME did (and probably making sentiment even worse). </li>\n<li>I believe at $30-$40 the core business is reasonably priced and the value thesis is proved out. There are other stories (short squeeze and the business transformation) that remain. IMO these are far less certain, but in this market a good story might be worth $100. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1>Charts + comments</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kyuu2rh4rab61.png?width=2769&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ce9dc1dc310e756ff294b88061557fad2726a50\">Entering via CCPs</a></p>\n\n<p>I hear about $GME. The business model of buy kids consoles for pennies on the dollar seems lucrative, video game sales in general are good, but COVID + things going digital are big question marks. The stock is up a lot from lows, but only liars buy at the low and sell at the high. Still seems reasonable, I sold weekly $10P (felt good about this).  Put premiums were good (3.6% for 3 days) and I figured I could get write for a couple weeks before being assigned. </p>\n\n<p>Also, picked up some 1/15/21 $30C (retard FOMO, I even noted as much &quot;Getting in w/o doing full research based on Burry and Ryan Cohen + extremely high short interest. Very speculative at this point. Console refresh upcoming + GME while not vibrant is healthy balance sheet wise&quot;).</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8746byjkrab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c210980355934995c97ea8151066f07a9d449b48\">Assigned... Ok, time to wheel</a></p>\n\n<p>Assigned on the first set of Puts. Fuck. Down 3-ish%. No worries, I&#39;ll collect more of that sweet premium w/ CCs at $10. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8x1iv0kesab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=791ec4aec2a3929bc6622a3427539f11c6a0c42a\">MSFT News hits</a></p>\n\n<p>MSFT news released. No real details. Some people are mocking it saying it is just an agreement to buy MSFT products. Yeah, that&#39;s one way to read it. (We&#39;re 3 months past this date and still don&#39;t know the specifics...). Missed a 40% jump that settled around 20%. The wheel gave me a 7% return instead. $30C bounced up. Continue to do option writing strategies (purchasing for CCs or near the money Puts). Unsure whether I&#39;m being an idiot and should just go long, but things feel speculative and I like the idea of generating returns now (even lower) to buffer against the downside. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3jtvwmdgtab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be9dea874271eef7c638f105e7d4d85603836579\">https://preview.redd.it/3jtvwmdgtab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be9dea874271eef7c638f105e7d4d85603836579</a></p>\n\n<p>We rocket again! Can&#39;t even remember their being news. Shorts are getting squeezed for sure. I&#39;m missing out.  I buy 1000 shares at $15.06. I kind of feel retarded so I hedge it by selling CCs against half the position. Weekly at first, but then $16C 6 weeks out. </p>\n\n<p>$30C still have massive bid/ask spreads but have gone up nicely (150%)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/d11ov8twuab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c822ab096d7312bde938adfac6de41ed6ffe2b16\">https://preview.redd.it/d11ov8twuab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c822ab096d7312bde938adfac6de41ed6ffe2b16</a></p>\n\n<p>Jesus fucking Christ. So glad I sold those longer dated CC, but still took a bath. Really wondering if I&#39;m just an idiot buying in at the top. I also really start considering longer dated $10 Puts (20% for 2 months was available), but pussy out. </p>\n\n<p>I dump the $30C as well on the way down ($1k profit off a $1k position)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/d1lkmd59vab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=123b123f3eecde3f236e7d29db7f716b1c65cc4a\">https://preview.redd.it/d1lkmd59vab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=123b123f3eecde3f236e7d29db7f716b1c65cc4a</a></p>\n\n<p>Cohen sends a letter to the board. Market doesn&#39;t seem to care. The embarrassment of holding GameStop grows in me. I do a bit of buying to sell ATM CC&#39;s. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gwv65lwqvab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bad068ef1a0d5780545dbc580737a45d774008e\">https://preview.redd.it/gwv65lwqvab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bad068ef1a0d5780545dbc580737a45d774008e</a></p>\n\n<p>Shit runs up again. Intense FOMO. Feeling like an idiot for not buying when things went back to ~10. I&#39;m doing the exact opposite of what you&#39;re supposed to do. A week ago I thought $GME was shit. Now I want to back up the truck... I held off buying at $13 (It&#39;ll pull back), $14, $15 (c&#39;mon). I finally buy at 500 shares @ $16.01, 300 shares at $17.22, 700 more at $19.10. Watching this run up while holding a small position is ruining my Thanksgiving holiday...</p>\n\n<p>Feeling like a sucker I hedge w/ CC&#39;s. IV is thru the roof going into the Earnings call. I expect some detail on the MSFT deal. Hopefully the terms they got were good. Ideally they talk about similar deals w/ Sony and Nintendo (They got Reggie on the board, that&#39;s got to be a layup, right?). </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/o8xq3fmiwab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d93203eea9a8e1a1ed17f6087cffaa7f22e3dd9\">Sherman gives a terrible CC</a></p>\n\n<p>Jesus. The numbers weren&#39;t that bad, but it&#39;d be hard to shit the bed more if he tried. </p>\n\n<p>- No earnings guidance</p>\n\n<p>- No partnership deal details</p>\n\n<p>- $100M in possible share dilution via a Shelf offering. </p>\n\n<p>- No discussion of Cohen or other large holders who have presented suggestions for a turnaround (but we got &quot;Omnichannel&quot; boys!)</p>\n\n<p>I go from feeling like a moron for not having more to feeling dumb for holding any of this POS. How is this stock going to go up when the management has its head up its ass? I&#39;m fucked. Holiday #s are the next big news item and these idiots will downplay them. Fuck. FUCK!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ubwu5lkbyab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffb32464ea1644732caba3752a03921d2cc1a55a\">Cohen ups to 13.1&#37;</a></p>\n\n<p>There was serious talk of Cohen walking away. He had a low enough cost basis to make a good profit.  He re-affirms and ups his share. \ud83d\ude80 back on the menu. Why don&#39;t I have more of this? I missed another golden opportunity...</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/u398ihwbzab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce4aa76f4c7b0fb3dd3cd19cb6b7a14fb81f8de5\">Random drop</a></p>\n\n<p>I sold some CCPs near the top, pretty far out of the money. Would have been assigned at $18. Instead, I close the position for a small profit on the premium, don&#39;t want to up my $GME holdings. Already feels like too much exposure. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4x2txed31bb61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d3202709646cdffdf214d4747df21903d128db7\">\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Yesterday</a></p>\n\n<p>Cohen and the board were added Monday. Mild move up (10%). TBH I&#39;d barely processed that news when the 60%+ day occurred. </p>\n\n<p>I had 1500 shares w/ only 3 CC&#39;s written against them. Proceeded to sell CC&#39;s (8 contracts) at $25, $26, $29. I was expecting the move to stop at 15-30%. Obviously misjudged that but that&#39;s been my experience. I also really wanted to do the smart thing for once and take profits (relax, not selling shares, just writing contracts) on the upswing vs my normal retarded MO of buying high hoping to sell higher. </p>\n\n<p>Was eye-balling selling the $40C when it hit 600IV ($6 premium for 3 days...), but by that point I was so gunshy (every call I&#39;d written to that point was blown by) and convinced this was going to infinity. I&#39;m resisting the urge to buy, but its hard. Instead I sold some CCP&#39;s at $15k worth of $25 (4% return over 3 days). Those 1/15/21 $30C, even w/ massive theta decay, are selling for 3X what I got. </p>\n\n<p>As confident as the market re-affirming my beliefs makes me $GME still isn&#39;t turning a profit yet.
