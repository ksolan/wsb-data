{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "There was some action in another thread about this, but thought I'd summarize my math on possible dealer/MM forced selling friday. **At present, it appears that  as many as 15.3m shares of GME will get dumped between now and the close Friday, and GME has float of 46m shares. This is essentially the reverse of yesterday, when I believe banks/dealers/mms essentially bought a good fraction of that, or maybe even a bit more using longer option exposures, on the way up, causing the huge melt up we saw.**\n\n**I'm not saying GME is a bad or good stock, and I'm not saying Cohen's plan is good or bad. I'm not saying there isn't a future further short squeeze. I'm just saying that a massive block of selling may occur Friday on dealer hedging behaviors. And I am saying congratulations to all the longs who made a ton of money here (I certainly did earlier).**\n\nI went through and counted all of the open interest of all options expiring on GME Friday - calls and puts - and then multiplied that by deltas when GME stock at $40. It's changed a bit since then. I used yahoo finance data, which may be slightly stale and cause some inaccuracy here. \n\nAssumption: 90% of all calls and puts have a dealer on the short side hedging. If there are more named thetagang sellers, the implications are lesser, but I find it unlikely these aren't mostly dealer options.\n\nFindings:\n\nAssuming the 90% hedging, total shares to hedge options expiring on Friday is as follows: calls is around 15.85m shares. Total shares SHORT to hedge puts is around 525 thousand.  This means total shares or equivalents being held long by dealers/banks/mms to hedge right now JUST FOR FRIDAY (does not include longer dated options) is long 15.3m shares.\n\nWhen Friday is ending, a few things happen:\n\n1. If options are held to close, they get GME stock settled. Those won't affect price, assuming those who get the GME stock hold. But most people would not do that as option traders.\n2. If you dump your massive tendie bearing options, you dump them to a dealer who in turn uses that call to neutralize their exposure, so they sell the delta exposure of your stock. If you sell a $20 call right now, a dealer is going to immediately dump 99.5 shares of GME stock.\n3. OF course, if you do #2, then promptly buy new GME options, you offset some of this, but you won't offset most of it. A massively in the money call has a delta of 1, while a decently OOM call has a delta in the .1 to .3 range, which means net selling of 70 per contract , unless you buy a LOT more contracts, and options are getting more expensive. Of course, while a lot of us will roll to other GME calls, I'm sure some of you will take money out for taxes, or go buy other options on other things, or even take the put side of this trade.\n4. And here's the kicker. Brokerages start forcing liquidations on these options as the close on friday approaches. If you would be out of margin compliance on the exercise of your massively appreciated options (by having a ton of GME stock and a huge negative cash balance after exercise), they'll simply force you to sell your options at the bid the MMs are offering. That then starts the cascade I just outlined in #2. You can then roll that into 3 if you want.\n\nBe really careful here. This could entirely moon even higher next week. And there's a ton of longer dated OI I did not analyze. But Friday and early Tuesday looks really scary in terms of dealer de-hedging, and the massive run we had these past few days looks like a gamma squeeze where these banks/dealers/mms had to accumulate shares to hedge all of their short options. Remember, there\u2019s a huge gamma ramp in the 20s and low 30s that shot this up yesterday. That same ramp can shoot this stock down too. \n\n**This is one of the largest dealer unwinds we've seen in any stock, and really anything could happen. More importantly, there's not currently a lot of gamma ramp above this, in part because it was hard to buy options at higher strikes until basically today. The fact the stock is levitating up today is in part because there\u2019s no share supply due to how much dealers are holding to hedge options.**\n\nDisclaimer: I did buy deep oom puts targeting NEXT week, and would make a ton of money if this came to pass. I put in about $100k in capital mostly in Jan 22 $28 puts.  This week makes more sense, but I'd get liquidated too by my broker if GME pukes Friday, so the trade won't work.
