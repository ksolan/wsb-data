{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**Introduction**\n\nFord is an American multinational automaker that has its main headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903. The company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand, and most luxury cars under the Lincoln brand. Ford also owns Brazilian SUV manufacturer Troller, an 8% stake in Aston Martin of the United Kingdom and a 32% stake in Jiangling Motors.[7] It also has joint-ventures in China (Changan Ford), Taiwan (Ford Lio Ho), Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand), Turkey (Ford Otosan), and Russia (Ford Sollers).\n\nFord was recently recommended by Cramer as a [buy](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stock-market-today-with-jim-cramer-ford-amazon-deutsche-bank-trump). After he did so, I began my DD.\n\n**The Current State of Ford**\n\nFord has done what many other automakers have done - they have shifted to unibody platforms allowing production to swap based on demand. We all know the F series is Ford's bread and butter - they have been able to capture a large portion of the light-truck market for years. That isn't what has me excited and the stock tanking over the last 5 years while they have had that market is why.\n\nIt's no secret that Ford was behind the ball on shifting to new technologies. Their previous CEO, Jim Hackett, was slow to adapt and shares fell 40% under him - they should have had an EV out years ago but had the mentality that what we have is good enough.\n\nThat hasn't been the case under their  new CEO - in October 2020 Jim Farley began a massive multi-billion restructure of Ford to shift their focus away from milking the F-Series market and focusing on autonomous vehicles, EV vehicles, and higher profit margins. \n\n**The Positives I see**\n\nThere are three factors that I think provides Ford a big opportunity to grow in the short and long-term.\n\n* Factor 1 - Ford is severely undervalued in the market. Ford is the fifth largest auto maker and has had a small rally of 26.78% over the last three months. That still puts them well below their five-year high (-$23.44% over the last 5 years) with only a current market cap of 38.909B. GM by comparison, has made a 53.65% run in the last 3 months and has a market cap of 69.748B. Tesla, has a market cap of 809.90B. Ford has a lower market cap than many much smaller auto makers - it has room to roll. Ford took a large stock hit at the beginning of the pandemic, but, the reality is their sales were largely unaffected - it was production that hurt Q4 20 sales. There was an over adjustment here.\n\n**Factor 2 - EV Fleet vehicles. Ford has already dipped their toes into the EV market with the Mach E. I don't believe Ford electrifying their F-Series trucks is a large future just based on the lack of overlap between EV demographics and the F150 demographic. What I do believe is the future is using the E-450 platform for commercial uses, like electric shuttle busses and more. There are other companies whos business model is to [use the E-450 platform to do so](https://www.phoenixmotorcars.com/products/). Ford having the platform and now technology in place (including a partnership with Rivian) leads me to believe this is going to be an emerging commercial sector.\n\n**Factor 3 - Profit margins are at the forefront. Ford was always able to capture volume - their problems with profit margin have been between production and warranty costs. This has been a large center of focus under Ford's new leadership - there's only so much you can do to reduce production costs. The focus has been on reliability to reduce warranty costs which is something Ford has severely needed to do.\n\n\n**My Positions**\n\ntldr; Ford is undervalued and has a bright future under current leadership, which is focusing on emerging technologies. \n\nHere are my current positions:\n\n1.
