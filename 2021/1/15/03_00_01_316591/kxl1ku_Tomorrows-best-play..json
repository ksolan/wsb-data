Anything this woman touches turns to gold, as if $PLTR wasn\u2019t already. Not only has ARK been consistently purchasing $PLTR since it\u2019s DPO but just yesterday she happened to purchase another 500,000 shares. Why would someone do that for an analyst rated stock at $15? That\u2019s because Citigroup is one of the lowest institutional shareholders on the board. Yet they never sold any of their shares even after the valuation they gave? That\u2019s what you call legal market manipulation, and if you didn\u2019t know they were trying to get a lower buy in. However, Cathie has once again saved us all.\n\nHere\u2019s the play: Theres a huge amount of short puts expiring tomorrow 1/15, and now every single one of those puts are OTM and will expire worthless. This is the best opportunity to double down on all shares if you don\u2019t already own, I definitely recommend getting in now. If everyone is on board with the same mindset, this is the 2021 shit show I had mentioned in my previous post. Tomorrow is the day, and I promise that even on a 10%+ premarket for PLTR, it is still a great buy. I say this because half the people in my last post were comments about \u201cAm I too late to get in?\u201d No, you\u2019re not. You just had a better opportunity to make even more, except there\u2019s still more to be made. Inaugural rocketship \ud83d\ude80.\n\nHere\u2019s a little more in depth about reasons to buy PLTR in the most simplest form because I know how retarded some of you are.\n\n1: PLTR DPO\u2019d, not IPO\u2019d. What the fuck does that mean? It means it gave every single one of us a chance to buy the stock at an extremely low price because institutional investors didn\u2019t get the chance to bid the stock price up like with a traditional IPO. Think of DoorDash or AirBnB, two IPO\u2019s that debuted at an absurdly high price. That\u2019s normal for IPO\u2019s, which is what happened with one of PLTR\u2019s competitors, $SNOW. Go look at their current price and do the math, similar company with a fraction of the amount of contracts that PLTR has but has a higher stock price. DPO\u2019s are something Institutional Investors hate, because retail investors (us) get to make the money instead of them, which is why they downgrade the stock in order to get lower buy-ins.\n\n2: Cathie Wood. Like I said earlier, she has the Midas touch. She will literally carry us to the moon if it\u2019s the last thing she does, and this is just the beginning.\n\n3: HUGE presentation on 1/26, that\u2019s literally 12 days away. This presentation will showcase PLTR\u2019s tech and give a better representation of what they really do since people don\u2019t seem to know. (They\u2019re the TOP of data collection, surveillance, etc. and have been doing this for 17 years.) Not only that but this presentation will have earning reports, which we all know are way above the predicted numbers.\n\n4. Tons of contracts already signed, and continually adding more almost weekly. They even have deals with the US Army. Are you fucking kidding me?\n\n5. Lockup. Now you\u2019d think that lockup means that PLTR stock will go down, which is possible and doesn\u2019t matter because the short squeeze happens before the lockup ends either way. BUT this is more than just a squeeze, because lockup doesn\u2019t mean that the price will necessarily go down. It\u2019ll undoubtedly go up even more before this because insiders want to capitalize on as much money as possible when they\u2019re allowed to sell their shares again. No one wants to sell at $25 when they can double that. Another reason why lockup CAN be a good thing is because it allows institutional investors to get back into the stock, with a much higher volume surfacing it gives them the chance to purchase FAT amounts of shares rather than minimal amounts like currently. There\u2019s only 20% of shares floating right now, and retail investors own 60% of that 20%, so institutions can\u2019t really buy anything right now. Which is why it\u2019s been sideways for so long. \n\nTL;DR: PLTR is going to rocket like crazy the next week or two, tomorrow is the beat day to perform a huge squeeze and fuck shorts over since Cathie Wood has just purchased 500k shares even after a downgrade by analysts. I really recommend you read this post, I\u2019ve dumbed it down quite a lot.\n\nPOS: I\u2019m now at 700 shares @25.52, never sold my calls that expire tomorrow because I had faith even though they were down 70%, but are already passed BEP in after-hours. Will be up huge tomorrow. 1/15 26c, 1/15 27c, 1/22 25.5c, 1/22 28c.\n\nEDIT: PLEASE just buy shares, calls are extremely high theta with PLTR and are painful to watch.
