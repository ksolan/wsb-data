{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Key qualitative strengths why BB is winning cybersecurity. Some stuff from my head, others from presentation at JP Morgan conference. I have been long BB since June 2019, waiting for this pop to happen. I used to work at RIM/BB (10 years ago) - nothing confidential here but I know the security culture well.\n\n1. **Pervasive security culture** that's decades long from history of building the most secure phones, networks, and servers. End to end encryption is not a new thing to BB. It has been a thing since the very very early days. Only in the last few years are other companies starting to talk about it. I worked there 10 years ago and the security culture was insane. It was harder to go into the prototype plant (RIM 8) than airport security. There's a reason why BB sold phones without cameras because we needed them ourselves. If your BB had a camera, you leave it at the door with security.\ud83d\ude80\n2. **Strong customer base** of critical infrastructure that cannot fail or get hacked - think nuclear power plants, the International Space Station, and cars driving down the road. All the top G20 governments, all the top 10 global banks. Remember Obama had a cell phone. It was a BlackBerry and was the first device ever to get approved for use by a president. This was 2008 but he wasn't using a fucking iPhone.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n3. **Strong enterprise and government sales experience** \\- BB has so much experience selling into the enterprise. B2B sales is not easy as any startup would know but they have been able to do so since the first RIM pager, to BlackBerry smartphones, and enterprise servers. Back in the day, BlackBerry was the only phone to work in disasters because they had dedicated networks and servers - BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS) and BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES). All your traffic gets routed separately from the general public.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n4. QNX **security certifications** for defense, government, automotive, medical, industrial.  ISO 26262 ASIL D, 61508 ASIL 3. These come from a fundamental design principles used for QNX and if competitors are to copy, they would have to start from scratch. QNX hypervisor uses microkernel virtualization to compartmentalize critical processes from non-critical ones. So if you have your autonomous driving or steering system controlled by BB software, your music app that gets hacked ain't touching the steering system. Other companies run through the same kernel, meaning that it is easier to hack.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n5. Customer **markets are growing massively. Autonomous driving and connected cars** is blowing up. That means automakers need to either build their own or buy secure software platforms. Considering the cost and time, everyone is buying (except maybe Tesla). As more cars are connected, you also attract more hackers and bad actors, which make automakers more likely to buy industry leading platforms like BB. It's a positive feedback loop. And more customers on this same platform mean more and more security because it makes fixed costs (hiring engineers) make more sense. More customers > more secure > more customers > more secure.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n6. Most cars use multiple chips to run the different systems. One for the infotainment, one for the drive system, one for the dashboard, etc. Increasingly, automakers are consolidating into single, high performance controllers (ECUs). What this means is that point A.4 above is increasingly more relevant, because a single chip needs to be uber secure. **QNX is designed for this. And 19 of the top 25 EVs already use QNX**\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n7. **AWS partnership to create middleware (IVY)** that allows more companies to build applications to use with the QNX platform. You can have all the best tech in the world, but if no one knows how to use it, or no one has easy access to it, it's useless. Well, this solves that problem as software engineers can now build on it much more easily. SWEs are like water and they use the tools with least resistance. This will create an ecosystem that Amazon and BB will push to the OEMs together.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n8. AWS IVY (the middleware) is OS and **cloud agnostic**. This means that if Amazon is being a shit partner, they can leave and move somewhere else. Obviously this is not ideal and would require some work, but it's not the end of the world. What this means is that Amazon won't be able to hold BB hostage with more fees if this takes off. It's **50/50 partnership with Amazon**. Think of the concept where you are a restaurant and you are getting good sales. The landlord sees that and they raise your rent. Well shit, you just did more work and your profits stay the same.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n9. **Pivot from hardware to software means subscription revenue.** What this means is that it is going to go on forever and customer has zero leverage until they want to rebuild their software. If you're an OEM and you build a car around this platform, you're paying BB until you redesign the car from the ground up - all the while you are paying BB every, single, fucking month. And if the OEM's contract with BB is running out, well, BB can raise their rates even higher. What is the OEM going to do? Stop producing a car and spin up another platform, redesign another car around that platform, and retool factories to build it? That takes years and billions, so they pony up to BB whatever fee increases they want. This is how AWS makes so much money.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80  \n\n\nEDIT: To put in some \ud83d\ude80 from popular request!", "author_fullname": "t2_5393c1xp", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "BB DD: 9 Reasons Why BB is \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 from former BB employee", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kxknrl", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 217, "total_awards_received": 3, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 217, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1610678519.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 1}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610705578.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Key qualitative strengths why BB is winning cybersecurity.
