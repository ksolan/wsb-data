Well here you fucking go because it is not too late, not by a long shot.\n\n**1.THE SHORTS ARE FUCKED.** I know you know this but honestly the evidence to so obvious but it just so fucking hard to believe because the shorts are almost as retarded as us. ALMOST.\n\n**Short Interest:** We have been collecting shorts faster than we are losing them. The fee to borrow the shares is now at 45% per year **meaning** shares are becoming very scarce (normal rates are 0.3%) and there are only 100,000 available short. An estimated **77.44 MILLION SHARES are still short.** While the daily volume of shares traded has has surged well beyond 70 million, most of the trading has not been short covering and lots of it has been shorting. \n\n**The Shorts are still in massively, shorts are currently deep underwater, holding each day costs them a ton, they will scrabble for the nearest exit as quick as they can ONCE it really gets going, DON'T GIVE THEM AN EASY EXIT.

Our lord and Savior Ryan fucking Cohen. He took Chewy from nothing and now its worth **47 Billion** and he started from scratch. Oh but what about \"digital downloads and amazon and other retailers killing GME business\". Did your Pets go hungry before Cohen created CHEWY? NO. Did Cohen capture a huge chuck of the market share of well established businesses with innovative thinking and create a company that was focused on the customers and E-commerce. YES\n\n3. **Fuck the** \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\n\n**E-Commerce**, say it with me E-Commerce, it's up 800% year-over-year, and the E-commerce genius, **RYAN COHEN,** just stepped in by buying 13% percent of the company. GME is not a dying company and we have't even got close to the fair market value. When the company wasn't posting profits and we had a board full of Boomers holding onto way too many poorly located retail stores I could see why people lined up to short this thing. But with **THREE BOARD SEATS** our soon to be CEO is going to pull off the most massive turnaround of any company we have ever seen. He said **GAMESTOP will be the Amazon of Games and MORE.** And games is big big fucking business, 44 Billion in the US and 165 Billion globally last year and growing fast. \n\n4. **GME to the MOON** \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80and staying there \ud83c\udf15\n\n**Cohen** is going to gut the unprofitable stores (we all know there were way too many in dying malls) and make the remaining stores the hub for all things even remotely gaming or high end consumer electronic related. The stores he does keep will be the thousands of wonderful little warehouses delivering your **NEW and USED** games, consoles, phones, drones, monitors, high end PC parts, and so much more. Not to mention the fact that gamestop will almost certainly start selling **used digital games.** If your buy your digital copy at gamestop they will let you sell it back to them so you can make a few bucks and they can make a lot more. Win Win. Oh and how about some store credit to keep Gamestop customers loyal. This will come to pass and it will be hugely profitable for Gamestop and rip the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bthesis to fucking shreds. \n\n5. **Market Cap Expectations are all that Matter**\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nWe all know that **expectations** front run real winners by a huge amount. Many of you have been feasting on Tesla and EV stock tendies for a while now. Tesla is now worth more than the largest nine car companies combined while only selling a tiny fraction of the cars. WHY???  Because it is lead by a visionary who can deliver. He will deliver and so will Cohen. Ryan Cohen will be a household name soon. **Gamestop is not stopping at $100** because that would put its market cap at **6.96 Billion.** I think **25 Billion or $360 a share** is fair value. \n\n**I am not SELLING!**\n\n**TLDR part 2: Buy more shares because Gamestop is still extremely undervalued and you should expect price to go to at least 100 but very likely way higher on fundamental expectations alone. Add in the short squeeze and we will be in Valhalla soon if YOU DO YOUR PART AND FUCKING HOLD!**  **The shorts can't exit unless we let them. We are an army and we are in this together.**\n\nPositions or Ban right...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8lsi46lajhb61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=9df640ff8afb7464b384ea0a587f21ea89dcc8fd\n\nIf you are still looking for more confirmation bias, because I know you know GME is going to Moon, check out this DD with links to more DD with links to more DD.

The stock was GSX. CITRON and all the other\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b were recommending the short because the company is obviously a total Chinese fraud. The shorts piled on like they have on GME and guess what it squeezed hard. Real Hard. Went from $30 to $141 and everyone, I mean everyone knew and still knows its a fucking fraud. It is hovering around $60 today and its garbage. Just think what GME can do when people actually want to own and hold it because Cohen will make this the most profitable game retailer in the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GSX chart.
