{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Hello, fellow autists.\n\nAmongst the understandable euophoria engulfing everyone over the past few days with positions in GME, or people looking to FOMO in, I would like to take a moment to break from the shitposting, hyping, and autistic rejoicing to spell out a couple of important things to consider. Keep in mind all of the following is coming from a GME bull with a significant position, backed by a mantra of 'IM NOT FUCKING SELLING'.\n\nFirst, a very general point: **Price oscillates**.\n\nI have been repeating this for the past few days hoping it will register with a few of you autists, but please keep in mind no matter what your sentiment to this play or any other is, price will oscillate and will never be green dildo after green dildo. You have to take the ocassional red bear dick up the ass before strapping on the impending green dildo thats forming.\n\nNow, specifically looking at the current GME situation, some things to consider:\n\nWhat we have witnessed over the past two days has been a gamma squeeze driving the price up. The true short squeeze has not initiated as the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b are currently scurrying to form potential exit strategies.\n\nNow your immediate reaction to the above might be \ud83d\ude80, but it might not be so simple. The way I see it, there are two possibilities:\n\n1. Best case scenario: \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b realize they are fuk, start to liquidate short positions in the upcoming week/s\u27a1\ufe0f valhalla for WSB. Pretty straightforward. Also, unfortunately, I would say the most unlikely scenario, \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b are too \ud83c\udf08 for it to be that easy, but it is in no way impossible. Here the only thing to worry about is at what price do you cash in, which is a discussion in and of itself.\n2. Most realistic scenario: \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b start to fear they are fuk, and begin to pull out every trick in the short selling book to suppress price and spread FUD in order to minimize the damage. Depending on how much these tactics work, this would initiate a short squeeze over a long period of time as shorts unwind. What this means is that if you believe in the bull thesis of GME+RC, you must \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1aand equally ride through all the gains along with the dips into valhalla.\n\nThe most important message I am trying to convey is that it all comes down to you and your resolve. If you are in this just to ride a quick intraday wave and book your baby gains, fair enough. However, if you truly believe in the fundamentals of the short squeeze, the fundamentals of RC turning this ship around, every time you consider selling, you're betraying your own belief in your judgment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Winning in any scenario requires knowing who youre up against, what to realistically expect, and most importantly, resolve.
