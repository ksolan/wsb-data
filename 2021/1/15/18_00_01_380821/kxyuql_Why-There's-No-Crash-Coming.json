Janet Yellen is known to be extremely dovish, which at the very least won't hurt\n4. We're currently in what is likely to be the worst phase of the pandemic, meaning: the worst economic news is coming out now and the latest round of stimulus isn't reflecting yet in the economic data\n5. While vaccinations are starting to pick up steam, by no means are they close to the point where society begins to reopen, which will likely begin happening in late March/April.\n6. There's MASSIVE pent-up demand from 2020 that will be pulled forward to 2021: going out, dining, travel, nightclubs, bars, retail, entertainment, sports, seeing friends and family - this will provide an epochal stimulus to the U.S. economy, and we will see truly blockbuster GDP growth numbers after Q1 2021\n7. The savings rate for Americans is at an ATH\n8. Consumer debt is at an all-time low\n9. Fintech firms like Robinhood, laugh at them as we may (even though most people here use them), simply have made equities and derivatives accessible for the average person.

Transformational industries like EV's, hydrogen power, big data, cloud computing, renewable energy - this is really happening, and happening now. And without Trump in the way, these trends will only accelerate (climate change, electrification, and so forth). Industries like clean energy have taken decades to get to this point. While DoorDash and Uber are cool, they're also just consumer conveniences, so people can spend $33 ordering pizza and wings to their overpriced apartment. While the story of the 2010's was consumer convenience, the market potential of the 2020's we will go back to major, earth-changing industry.\n12. While there are certainly mini-bubbles, isn't that more healthy than one massive bubble? If investors overprice hydrogen power stocks and they correct by 25%, it doesn't ruin the economy like the dot-com boom, subprime crisis etc.\n13. Rents went down in major metropolitan areas like NYC, San Francisco, etc. - which means people, specifically MILLENNIALS whose assets topped $10 trillion for the first time recently, will have more disposable income to save and invest. While rents won't stay low forever, this will provide a massive short-term stimulus for the millions of people who call these areas home. Moreover, incentives - like 1/2/3/4 months free - will put more money into savings of younger people, who spend more than boomers.\n\nI see interest rates going up, inflation, and mispricing of future income from these new industries like EV's, renewables, and so forth (aka \"bubbles\") being the biggest counterarguments here, but interested to hear what the smart money on wsb is thinking\n\nEDIT: added \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80", "author_fullname": "t2_4r1lx0mn", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Why There's No Crash Coming", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Discussion"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_kxyuql", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 52, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 52, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1610731308.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610759411.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>TLDR: stonks go up in 2021 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 </p>\n\n<p>No doubt 2020 was an epic year for the market.
