{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "This is long, if you\u2019re uninterested skip to the ten tips list or TLDR\n\nA while ago I started mixing unusual options activity into my gambling.  At first I lost a shitload of money chasing dumbass whales with zero plan, but now I actually have a pretty good feel for it.  I still fuck up alot, but more often I do not fuck up.  This is to help those of you who want to start chasing whales, or are at a basic level and want to do it better.\n\nI'm using some plays from this week as examples because they are fresh in my mind and I have a couple screenshots.\n\n**Tools**\nI use barchart.  You can honestly get by using their free version, you just can't sort as well.  They have a free month trial too.  I also pay the 20 bucks for Unusual Whales to confirm what I scan.  I have zero affiliation to either, just saying what I use.\n\nThere are way more technical ways to do this, but I like to use my eyes to scan sporadically throughout the day like a boomer.\n\n**Basic Concept**\nLong story short, you're ideally chasing the options purchases of what are, presumably, deep-pocketed individuals or institutions.  UOA identifies certain options contract orders that are higher than the average daily contract order.  For example, if the average daily option volume on an GME weekly is 4,000, and an option order enters for 4,000 or higher, it's flagged as unusual activity since it's a multiple of that daily average volume--sometimes it shows as multiple orders if \"they\" push through a few smaller purchases that produce heavy volume.\n\nMM are sneks who like to move in silence, which they can do with with stock positions via dark pools and shit.  However, they can't get away with that with options activity--it all shows.  That fact, young autist, is your slingshot against the institutional goliath.\n\n**Hunting the Whale**\nSo I've got my unusual options activity page open on barchart or wherever for the current day.  I adjust the expiration date option so that the options I'm looking at don't expire past a couple weeks out (more on why later), then I'm ready to eye scan.\n\nI typically start by looking for **one of two things: 1) large clusters of orders that belong to one ticker  or 2) sporadic orders for a ticker that consistently show up over a couple hours, but belong to non-hot, non-meme stonk that does NOT have earnings imminents.**  To make sure I'm looking at something potentially weird, I choose to exclude options that expire more than a couple weeks out.\n\n**1) Clusters of orders\u2014ABNB example**\nThe way I scope it is kind of a tiered process.  *First*, I'm looking to see if there are any clusters of orders that catch my eye on a quick scan.  *Second*, I'm looking to see if those clusters of orders contain both calls AND puts, with some OTM activity and spreads preferred.  *Third*, I look to see if the number of seperate call orders outweighs the number of put orders (or vice versa), and additionally I look to see if the volume of the calls drastically outweighs the volume of the puts (or vice versa).  \n\n**Why?  Because it helps you determine if the options order is just a hedge, or if it\u2019s hedging against itself as it\u2019s own positio**n. This is super important so try to follow along-- most UOA is just institutions hedging; Mr. MM has a nice, busy life and fancy yacht and can't just exit his positions back and forth all day like a WSBer.  He also has like a billion shares of his stonks, so if he dumps it when he's got paper hands it will siginficantly tank the value and cause a ripple effect.  So, *instead* of hedging by dumping his shit, he hedges by adding OTM options against his position--next level fucking diamond hands.  That would be the type of whale order from Mr. MM we don't want to follow.  *But*, if Mr. MM buys 4,000 FB call options in a few blocks, and you see like 1,000 in FB puts go through right alongside it, the odds are that someone is betting big on FB and using the puts as a hedge, since it's a smaller volume.  Instead of the options being a hedge for a bigger bet in their stocks, those type of option clusters indicate that potentially the option order itself is the big play, and it's hedging itself.\n\n**Then I do an easy confirmation**.  I check their general trend the past week or so in a chart, do a news search on twitter with their ticker for news catalysts and sentiment, and google and YouTube to see if the crayola kids think it's a good nerd play.\n\n**Example**: Here's the screenshot on some ABNB UOA I noticed and played this week.  It went to 200% and change within a couple hours, but I had unortunate diamond hands and sold for about half that.\n\n[ABNB UOA](https://i.imgur.com/mYDXYmN.jpg)\n\nSo, this a softball.  **First**, you can see that ABNB all of a sudden explodes with all those options showing up at 12:52, that's our cluster.  **Second**, the clusters have both calls and puts in that minute, with some put orders at the bottom.  Some of the calls are deep OTM, as far as 200c.  **Third**, the call orders far outweigh the put orders in both amount and volume.  Awwwww shit, looks like we got more than a hedge--we're onto something.\n\n**Confirmation time**: ABNB had been on a general uptrend, and I typically don't like to chase, but I combed twitter and saw their were rumors of the CEO speaking the following day, and that news had just broken of their DC booking cancellations.  I looked back into the morning, and saw a few more unusual blocks, and a few more rolled in just after that one.\n\nPassed the smell test.  Options bought, tendies gained.\n\n**Sparse Orders: SNAP example**\n\nThe same principles can apply to orders on tickers that pop up individual orders, not large clusters,  which **a) haven\u2019t had much attention b) have been on a steep downtrend\u2014this makes the order unusual and/or c) seem to keep popping up in single orders over a few hours to a day.**The same principles as above apply, but if you see these types of orders with very little time left until expiration, you can assume assume it's probably not a hedge.  SNAP isn't the best example of the week because there wasn't a put order in this block.  But, there was positive TA sentiment when I searched, SNAP had been on an oversold downtrend, and I don't have screenshots left of the better ones I saw and went after.  **Plus, importantly, IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY** (this is huge, EOD is prime time for AH news whales)\n\n[SNAP UOA](https://i.imgur.com/GGr5bra.jpg)\n\nA better example from this week though is SPCE, which had only a few orders sprinkled throughout the day, and a one toward the end of the day which was DEEP, DEEP OTM expiring 1/15.  **That\u2019s a flag for us\u2014sporadic listing throughout the day, OTM toward the end of the day. ** BAM! EOD Otm calls sprinkle in, ARK invests \n\n**Sparse Orders Patterns: Connecting the dots on tech rebound with FB and SNAP**\n\nSeeing the SNAP orders above sharpened my eyes to looking for a pattern with tech on the whole, since big tech had been so royally gaped the past week.  I kept seeing FB options like this pop up\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/muVGtq2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T54peER.jpg)\n\nSometimes you can put together sporadic listings and create a working theory based on a sector.  Because this and similar FB orders were deep OTM and one day out, I knew there was a risk they could a hedge, but also knew that the tech sector was due for a rebound and saw SNAP posting sporadic OTM as well.  **So, I bought my options for each of those two another week out and closer to ATM (important, more below), to give the whale some breathing room** in case was it was a hedge, even though the technicals agreed with the bounce.  The whales were right, and it was an easy little overnight profit.\n\n\n**How I\u2019ve Fucked Up 1: Don\u2019t get tricked by trends**\n\nAlthough we like to believe institutions are ahead of the curve, often they are just dick-riding lemmings who follow what's already way, way up.  They buy the top, just like WSB tardies such as yourself specialize in.  When you see shit like this think before you get excited:\n\n[NIO UOA LIKE THIS WAS NONSTOP](https://i.imgur.com/JCZBx2s.jpg)\n\nIt was the same for all the memes: PLUG, FCEL, MARA, and RIOT all week, dominating the orders.  If something is already too popular, just stay away from it.  You can ride something up, but when you see massive orders on shit that's already like 400% IV, just...don't.\n\n**How I\u2019ve Fucked Up 2: DO give the MM\u2019s some breathing room**\n\n*Even if you\u2019re confident in a move you see that is a few days out, extend your play a week or two further out minimum, and strike it closer to ATM.*  If you can't do either of those things because you can't afford the premium  just skip that play and check back for something new later, I promise better opportunity will arise.  You can recover from bagholding, but you cannot recover from blowing your account on an incorrect 0DTE.\n\nBreathing room is also important because often whales will have the news but not the exact timing.  Two months ago I followed a DDOG whale on a Thursday 1DTE that expired worthless the next day.  The following Monday (1 trade day later) DDOG made the announcement that rocketed them like 20%--if I'd given them a week's breathing room, it would've been a 15 bagger.  Fucking F.\n\n**So, to review:** look for order clusters or sporadic ticker order that a) have a mix of calls and puts with one dominating the other b) unpopular tickers that have deep OTM or close expirations c) always check chatter afterward and fundamentals and d) try to put together a narrative of things that are related that catch your eye (this Monday's EV run or this Friday's tech bounce could be next week's airline dominance or cruiseline craze--connect the dots).  Initially look for options expiring soon, as they indicate the most riskiness--and therefore confidence--if the MM is not hedging.\n\n**10 Things That Will Help You Not GUH):**\n**1)** Monday and Friday morning/afternoon are the most accurate whale times, according to data from Unusual Whales\n**2)** If you don't have PDT always save some spending power for EOD shopping\n**3**) If you don't have PDT never, ever follow a whale with a weekly.  Sometimes the news the whales bets on is a 'sell the news' event\n**4)** Always give the whale breathing room by purchasing an expiration at least a week further out\n**4b**) Always give the whale breathing room by going closer to ATM strikes than theirs\n**5)** Sign up for barchart monthly trial and unusual whales--they're each like 20 bucks and thats way less than you spend on an FD\n**6**) You don't need to learn TA, but you need to check technicals on the tickers you want to chase--almost every major ticker has youtubers or fintwits giving their daily or weekly TA.  This way you know if it's a proper breakout happening if the whale hits, and you're not just guessing at when to take profits.  Remember, they can buy wayyyyyyy OTM and sell for massive profit at any point--they aren't bagholding until it's in the money\n**7**) Leave at least 10% of your account spending power free each day.  I promise, the one time you go full boat you will see the most obvious whale play at the end of the day.  Then you won't be able to do shit about it and you'll hate yourself when it's a 10 bagger overnight.  Trust me.\n**8**) Make sure the ticker you're chasing isn't just ER anticipation/bets.  Always check earnings dates before buying.\n**9**) Remember whales are people, so they can be stupid, too.  Don't baghold a position that is clearly fucked for some news that looks unlikely to come.  They are gambling addicts just like you, except they have more money.\n**10**) Always take profits if you ask yourself if it's time to.  If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close the position.\n\n**Positions**:\nDumped a ton of stuff and loading up Tuesday because long weekends scare me, but saw some ineresting 2/5s I held including\n\nWKHSc\nPLTRc\nSPYc (1/19, 1/22)\nLMNDp\n\nAnd a couple tickers that I couldn\u2019t post lol.  also have AAPL and JD leaps\n\n***\n\nTLDR\nUse a service to follow whales so you can get ahead of announcements.  Look for clusters of options activity that hedge themselves via call/put ratio, and do a legitimate check for TA and catalysts to confirm their moves.  Never follow a whale into a weekly, but use weeklies are your best screener.\n\n***\n\n*I might do a pretty consistent DD post (a couple times a week) on what I\u2019m seeing at the end of each day if there is interest, and if it\u2019s not a day I don\u2019t have a ton of real work.  If something quick catches my eye I usually throw it up on my twitter @yourboymilt.  I\u2019ll also probably throw some more potential Monday positions on here over the weekend once I decide to do some more research.
