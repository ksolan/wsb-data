{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Hello, fellow retards \n\nTLDR: GME to the moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nI want to talk to you about the possible short squeeze and the comparisons between GME and VW. \n\nAs you possibly know, the infinity squeeze at VW was orchestrated by Porsche, by gaining control of over 70% of all outstanding shares through options and share purchases. Since Porsche's goal was to overtake VW at that time, selling for a profit was never an option. They only stepped in, when short sellers were begging them to sell them shares for an unbelievable amount of money to close their position. That's what really caused the \"infinity squeeze\" we are often referring to. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eb6zqvx4iob61.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe6d9fcd635c3070a3245368dec153a06ce89439\n\nBut there lies the problem with GME. Many of the 1.8 Million Degenerates in here have acquired shares of Gamestop because of the uncountable DD's & Memes about this stock.  Many of those, except people like u/deepfuckingvalue, u/cpthubbard and other OG GME Bulls who are playing the long game, did this in hindsight of a potential squeeze so that they could sell it after a short time for a profit. We're experiencing it right now that FOMO really kicks in and we just don't know at what time, people will say to themselves: \"Okay, this is getting ridiculous, I have a profit of 1000%. I should sell my shares and lock in those gains\" \n\nBut let me tell you one thing. You'll never regret anything more in your life, than selling GME too early. I mean it! I had 1800 Shares and sold 900 yesterday (01/15 for $41,38). At first I thought, wow nice, I made a lot of money on this, but after an hour or two, i started to doubt my decision. I started to wonder why I decided to do this. And i felt real regret, since I let Papa Cohen and all of you guys down. I am talking about that \"i didn't pull out behind my local wendy's and now I have to pay child support for the rest of my life\" - kind of regret. \n\nSo what did I do? I fucking bought all of my shares back, sitting strong again on 1800 Shs, costbasis of 20$ and am ready to visit Andromeda for a trip. But are you? Are you strong enough to see past the 1000% gains and realize that we are the ones in control? That we can dictate the price we want to sell for? That 420,69 or 694,20 is f\\*cking reachable if all toilet paper hands decide to grow DFV hands and hold the line like Spartan Soldiers at the mountain pass of Thermopylae. \n\nOUR TIME HAS COME, AND IF SOMEONE CAN FUCK THIS ONE-IN-A-LIFETIME TRADE UP- it's only US. \n\nKEEP THAT IN MIND, BUY MORE AND STAY STRONG! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "author_fullname": "t2_8mui9b0x", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "GME: Autists in control", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Discussion"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 89, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "media_metadata": {"eb6zqvx4iob61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 69, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eb6zqvx4iob61.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=560857d81f0d8d2cf8a190a8115f8be2ce7a60f0"}, {"y": 138, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eb6zqvx4iob61.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0e86a4da32b058557e4093ad1c92406a6cc5a12e"}, {"y": 205, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eb6zqvx4iob61.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=dd248c93e5f7309a97f1a4bd29c4b5c04eea9dd3"}, {"y": 411, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eb6zqvx4iob61.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e15c34c8da4075a4df0fe0a21f04099e44e36232"}], "s": {"y": 501, "x": 780, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eb6zqvx4iob61.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe6d9fcd635c3070a3245368dec153a06ce89439"}, "id": "eb6zqvx4iob61"}}, "name": "t3_kyh9zv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 32, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 32, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/SoCthdOXmKezJqt0ko_QSa1K0eK4Wtmq-fcwJWQjUUo.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610824932.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello, fellow retards </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: GME to the moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80</p>\n\n<p>I want to talk to you about the possible short squeeze and the comparisons between GME and VW. </p>\n\n<p>As you possibly know, the infinity squeeze at VW was orchestrated by Porsche, by gaining control of over 70% of all outstanding shares through options and share purchases.
