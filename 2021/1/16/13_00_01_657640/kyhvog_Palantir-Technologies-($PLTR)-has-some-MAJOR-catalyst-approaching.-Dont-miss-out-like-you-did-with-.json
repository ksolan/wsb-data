Regardless, there\u2019s a number of reasons to be loading up on SHARES before the \ud83d\ude80 takes off.\n\n1. Institutional\u2019s are loading up on PLTR prior to the major catalysts (ARK recently upped their stake by 497,100 shares and so did another number of firms).\n\n2. Demo Day: 26th of Jan we\u2019ll see PLTR do a demonstration day of their main product offerings. This will undoubtedly draw attention and traction to the stock as people better understand the recent standardisation of PLTR\u2019s software. This standardisation is what has enabled them to target over 6,000 large institution/enterprise customers across all verticals. Ultimately this will show their commercial viability outside of what they\u2019re known for (governmental contracts) and will result in a stock uptick due to their future viability.\n\n3. Earnings Day: Early February we shall see PLTR\u2019s earnings report for Q420. This should also cover some of the forward-looking aspects of it\u2019s recently acquired contracts alongside projections. If you are unaware of those contracts, see the link here: [LINK](https://investors.palantir.com/home/default.aspx)\n\nAs Palantir will most likely pass $1bn in revenue, this is likely to be a big day.\n\n\n4. Lockup period: Employees and the like are able to liquidate some of their positions come mid February. This has obvious negative connotations to it but for the most part what most people don\u2019t understand is that there will only be a minuscule amount of shares which will be CASHED in. Employees will not cash in all their shares as they will also notice and realise the growth potential of their stock options. They will maybe cash in a small amount if needed but the firm has just began properly marketing their product and concentrating on business development, employees and us alike know the growth potential of this stock.\n\nOnce a lower-than-anticipated amount of stock is liquidated, this will most likely have an inverse effect. People will realise that this dip won\u2019t happen and there will be a scrambled influx to buy in. Most likely driving the stock up and pushing it to ATH (unless we have another Citi downgrade bcos IBs love a bit of MM).\n\n\nThat\u2019s all.\n\nTLDR; Buy PLTR shares NOT calls for the time being or you will see beautiful \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 and realise you have missed out on the next $GME / $TSLA", "author_fullname": "t2_4zu95h1t", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Palantir Technologies ($PLTR) has some MAJOR catalyst approaching.
