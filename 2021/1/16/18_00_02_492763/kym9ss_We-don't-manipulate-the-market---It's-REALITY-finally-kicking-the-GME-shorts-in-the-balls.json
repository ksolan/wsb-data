That's right 6 billions\n\nDo you know the current market cap after the crazy week we had ? 2,4 billions\n\nDo you know how much cash per shares GME has on hand ? 5$ of NET cash per share. \n\nThat's right boys even after all the price action we had the P/S ratio is not even 0,5. Just to give you an idea of what this represents Best Buy is at 0,8.\n\nGME is a short bubble, just like before 2008 the market maker were too stupid to just read the fucking mortgage bonds to see they were filled with shit loans, the big player are too stupid to just read the balance sheet and guidance of the company they are betting against. \n\nAnd now that the market begins its correction, all the people for who it was a sure bet that \"GME is the next Blockbuster\" are not accepting the fact they were wrong, so they are blaming other for their mistakes. \n\nRight now the narrative is clear : WE are responsible for a pump and dump purely to crush them, so they are not responsible for anything and they have a perfect story to tell to accuse us of market manipulation while scaring every other investors who would think about getting on the GME train. \n\nBut THEY have been the one doing market manipulation ! It's NOT us who have suppressed the price for so long, it's NOT us who have put this stock of the threshold security list for 27 TRADING DAYS STRAIGHT !\n\nIf we actually had the power to trigger a short squeeze we would have done it a while ago, we have been BEGGING for it for months ! And right now according to latest data shorts have not even began to cover...\n\nSaying we are triggering a short squeeze is as dumb as saying Burry and the big shorts before 2008 are responsible of the housing crash. No it's REALITY finally showing up and triggering that short squeeze, us, GME bulls, are just riding the correction !\n\nFor the new crowd : NO we cannot trigger a short squeeze on your new shitty stock just because the short interest is high ! NO we don't manipulate the market \n\nAnd for my beloved GME gang, as Daddy Cohen said it's going to be a bumpy ride, stay strong and don't worry : this is not a pump and dump, we are still far away from fair value not even accounting for RC magic, just let the shorts cry like baby and don't pay attention to people trying to give us power we don't have.\n\nEdit : forgot my position, 340 shares", "author_fullname": "t2_1196ou", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "We don't manipulate the market - It's REALITY finally kicking the GME shorts in the balls", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Discussion"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_kym9ss", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 286, "total_awards_received": 3, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 286, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1610817095.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 1, "gid_2": 1}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610844280.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>TLDR : We don&#39;t manipulate the market, it&#39;s the short who can&#39;t manipulate it anymore and have reality kicking them in the ball, right now they are to happy to blame us for it.</p>\n\n<p>First I have to say first congrats to the GME gang, for some of us it will be the trade of a lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>But right now this sub is becoming crazy.
