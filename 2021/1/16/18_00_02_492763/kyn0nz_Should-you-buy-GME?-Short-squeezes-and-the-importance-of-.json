{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "# TL;DR at the bottom\n\nLong-time lurker here, finally starting to post with the imminent GME squeeze\n\nThought it would be helpful to give a VERY BRIEF, slightly more serious explanation on the current situation to the influx of new members:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore we start, here's a nice little glossary of autistic terms used around here:\n\n\ud83d\ude80  = stock gonna go up\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 = holding onto a stock like a god\n\n\ud83d\udcdd\ud83d\udc50 = selling like a loser\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, currently Gamestop (GME) is on a pretty inevitable short-squeeze path, what does that mean? It means it's about to do something like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[fuckin ridiculous am i right, a more recent example would be tesla \\(TSLA\\) if you think this is old boomer shit](https://i.redd.it/frjx9fil1qb61.gif)\n\nNow the mechanics of it why short squeezes happen are a little complicated for beginners but here are some threads and other links explaining them IF you want to learn more:\n\n[WSB Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/)\n\n[Video explanation if you can't read like many of the autists here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRyWZ6CXqM)\n\n[Boring Boomer website explanation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp)\n\nThere also a lot of other factors at play here, but go search that on your own, there's tons of good threads here on WSB\n\nAND if you're really serious about it, ACTUALLY RESEARCH GAMESTOP, its annual revenue, market cap, stocks in general, but lmao none of y'all gonna do that so:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo should you buy GME stock asap?\n\nDo you like free money? Fuck yeah buy that shit \ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHOWEVER here are some VERY IMPORTANT things you should be mindful of in these upcoming weeks:\n\n* The very tippy top of Short-squeezes last fairly long, in the picture above (Volkswagen) it shot up and stayed there for a whole day (at around $600, it did spike at a crazy $1000 for a couple hours though), SLOWLY coming back down over a few days, then finally dropping. THIS MEANS this isn't some minute-by-minute play here, you have some time, just make sure you are prepared.\n* In these coming days (or maybe weeks) GME price will waver up and down as the big corporations (Melvin \ud83d\udc7f) start trying to cover their asses until eventually it will start spiking like crazy, the Short-squeeze will have started\n* Some shit might go down this TUESDAY, it might not, but some shit will ***definitely*** go down within the next week or so as corporations are losing big amounts of money as time goes by\n* THE LONGER PEOPLE HOLD \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 ONTO THEIR STOCKS, THE HIGHER CORPS LIKE MELVIN WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM, this brings me to my next and final point\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The importance of holding \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\n\nThe price of GME will most likely STAIRCASE upwards (going UP then down then UP, etc), as corps begin to short, people with \ud83d\udcdd\ud83d\udc50 (pussies) will begin to sell because of the \"profit\" they're making\n\nNot only will you regret it when the squeeze hits its peak, but you are letting the shorters get off easy by giving them cheap stocks\n\nImagine this:\n\nyou bought GME at $35, it goes up to $100, you panic sell cuz holy shit thats profit, you check again in an hour and see that GME is now $200 because of the many godlike \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 we have in this sub, then you start crying because not only did you hurt the cause, you missed out on a shit ton more money\n\n***This is the importance of holding \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso if you read the DD (basically theory on future prospects) on Gamestop, you'll realize that it actually does have a pretty bright future, so while this may be a pump and dump for many, **I'm sure this stock will actually reach quite a large number in the not so distant future** (just google Ryan Cohen)\n\nMy current estimation for the price target is:\n\nIt will ***definitely*** hit $100 within the next week\n\nIt will probably spike to around $200-$300 for a day or two\n\nIt has a small chance of going fucking nuclear and going past $300   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80  (small chance but definitely possible)\n\n***It of course, also has a chance of doing absolutely fucking nothing***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I didn't want to speak boomer but this is important as this subreddit is quite literally an addiction for a lot of people, DON'T PUT MONEY IN THIS STOCK IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE, WE'RE LITERALLY A BUNCH OF RETARDS (sometimes smart retards)\n\nTHIS IS NOT FINANACIAL ADVICE AND IF YOU LISTEN TO ME OR ANYONE ELSE ON THIS SUBREDDIT YOU ARE ALSO RETARDED LIKE ALL OF US\n\nThis squeeze is most likely NOT (fully) caused by us, (assuming we're around 10% of the shares) but I mean, 10% is quite a big number so we do have a little control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TL;DR: THE MORE OF US THAT HOLD \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 THE HIGHER GME WILL  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80\n\n# IT MIGHT BE A ROUGH FEW DAYS OR WEEKS BUT DO NOT WAVER, HOLD\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 AND YOU WILL BE REWARDED, SELL\ud83d\udcdd\ud83d\udc50 AND YOU'LL FOREVER GET LAUGHED AT BY EVERYONE HERE LMAO\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthank you for coming to my ted talk, and yes i do have many shares", "author_fullname": "t2_17djq2", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "Should you buy GME?
