If I make a reddit post, quite literally, there is no possible way I can be insider trading because I literally just posted the information on a public domain... thats like saying when  CNN or Bloomberg news posts an article that its insider information lol.  \n\nIts a public domain, and what you choose to do with that information is up to you.  CNN says \"Amazon to buy walmart for 1000$ a share\" then odds are its true.  If i make a post on here, odds are its not.  But if it was true, that wouldn't make it insider information because its open for the world to see.  \n\nNot to mention, no information anyone has ever posted on this sub would be insider information.  Because \n\n1.  None of you know anything about shit\n2. Once you post it, its no longer insider info\n3.  If you had it, no one would believe you\n\nAlso, the SEC wouldn't just shut us down.  The SEC would probably send a letter to reddit, saying \"they committed illegal activity\" and then reddit would notify the mods and tell us that it can't happen again.  If it was really bad, they would probably fine reddit.  Or maybe, reddit is looking for a reason to shut us down and would say \"you violated our rules, goodbye\". \n\nIf they felt like it was something that couldn't be fixed, then they would just tell reddit to shut us down, but if they haven't shut us down now, odds are they won't.  \n\nThis also assumes, the SEC doesn't like what were doing?  You really think after just DECADES of getting cucked by hedge funds, they're going to shut down a bunch of retail investors teaming up to cuck hedge funds and boomers?  Fuck no.  \n\nThe worst thing we have committed is pump and dump schemes, but that would require \"false or misleading information\" and typically 1 person with enough money to dump enough shares to move it.  Odds are this wouldn't be the case since we don't allow posts for microcap companies, and we dont allow false information, and several other things to prevent this.  \n\nSo all this \"GUYS STOP WITH THIS SEC GONNA GET US\" is the dumbest shit ive ever seen.  You don't know what you're talking about.  Shut up.  We're owned by reddit.  So its not like there's some magical button the SEC presses to say \"poof\" no more wsb.
