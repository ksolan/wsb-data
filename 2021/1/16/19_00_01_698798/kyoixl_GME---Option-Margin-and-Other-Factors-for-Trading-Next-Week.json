I actually lost money on my puts because the expressed vol was less than I thought, and Friday ended up playing out in a basically neutral way from a bull/bear perspective with a mere 10% drawdown. That post is here. I correct predicted the outcome, but didn\u2019t predict the magnitude well enough and thus my trade sucked:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxb7dy/analysis\\_of\\_massive\\_potential\\_gme\\_forced\\_selling/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxb7dy/analysis_of_massive_potential_gme_forced_selling/)\n\nIn this new post, I\u2019ll cover what I know about current option structure (and will update once updated data for Friday comes out), and the implications (TLDR: Mostly, expect vol around multiples of 5 in stock price), as well as other trading dynamic topics that I think are misunderstood or rarely spoken of.\n\nI\u2019m not going to talk about my opinion of the value of the stock or the turn-around plan. I\u2019m actually in what is a modest put position for me at the moment (jan 22 $38 puts x 80), but I fully acknowledge this could go to the moon  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80  next week and I'll feel like a miniature Melvin capital (though shorting at $38 is a lot smarter than at $17) and probably deserve it in that case.\n\n**Current Option Structure:**\n\nI will update this as new data gets in, but you can see big concentrations of options at 30, 35, 39/40 and 45. There isn\u2019t open interest data for Friday, but volume suggests there are further ramps at 50/55/60, but they are probably smaller than the 39/40 and 30 ramps. Normally, dealers are going to be long calls (from people selling covered calls) and short puts (From people buying protection). On GME I think we all know it\u2019s short calls and short puts, since people are buying tons of calls from them, and also speculating with puts. As such, dealers are extremely short gamma, and that means that prices accelerate from dealer activity greatly. When the stock sells, the dealers have to dump stock (or short it). When the stock goes up, dealers have to buy.  **I believe that the Wednesday melt-up was as much a short squeeze as a gamma squeeze, as the price moved over a bunch of OTM options, forcing dealers to buy as much as 1/3 of the total float of the company to hedge!**\n\nThese patterns are most sharp at these large concentrations of strike prices, so the stock can jump from 39 to 41 a lot easier than from 36 to 38 as an example. On average, it\u2019s about $1m of stock bought/sold by dealers per percent change. To put in context, there was a jump Friday where about 250k shares got bought and moved the price 5%. That means that if accurate, dealer activity might have been up to half in that flash.   **We don\u2019t yet have the Friday data, but there was a lot of Friday volume. This amplification may be greater next week. This week had a gamma event on Wednesday, after which there were a ton of ITM WSB calls and OOM Melvin puts that don\u2019t have gamma, and thus the price de-volatilized somewhat. But we may now be in a situation with a lot of near the money options, which means we could see very large gamma squeezes up or down again.**\n\nHere\u2019s the structure, I\u2019ll update once there is Friday OI data available. This chart assumes that calls are positive gamma \u2013 they will all be negative gamma in this case, so predict accordingly.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/czrKy6X](https://imgur.com/a/czrKy6X)\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the expirations next week. Here\u2019s the current structure for next week, using Thursday data, which I\u2019ll update once I get Friday data:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/4wKTspB](https://imgur.com/a/4wKTspB)\n\nThis is a lot less bearish than the Friday we just had, but again, I\u2019ll update once I get the data. It\u2019s still a net sell on Friday as those option positions get cleared out (people sell to realize, and then buy other things in general), but more like under 1/10th of float vs the 1/3 of float we were staring at this Friday. Unless people piled into ITM calls Friday, which I find highly unlikely. As such, the downwards force this coming Friday, if this Friday was -10%, is more like -2 or -3% in a vacuum.  However, the higher the prices go into Friday, the more selling this in turn causes Friday, so in a world where we end at $55 on Thursday, I'd definitely not go into Friday long as this forced selling increases.\n\nMy sense out of all of this is:\n\n\\- The current gamma structure provides more ramps up than down from $35, but there are strong ramps in either direction. BUT, the volume suggests a lot of new put positions were established. On net \u2013 volatility up, not bearish or bullish.\n\n\\- There is some forced selling this coming Friday, but if that was the driving force yesterday, it would be a -3% or -2% not a -10%.  Slightly bearish.\n\n\\- If the stock moons this week, I would encourage you to approach Friday with care, and a more bearish or defensive mentality, even if fundamentally bullish.\n\n\\- A LOT of capital went into OOM puts and calls this week targeting the week after. If the stock is not volatile, a lot of speculators bleed out on both sides.\n\n**Margin Changes**\n\nThere was a lot of talk about how various brokerages have increased margin requirements on GME stock. Some set to 100% (Schwab), others set up a bit (TDA from 70% to 75%),  others rumored to be planning but haven\u2019t (IBKR). The reaction of the sub is that this is bullish. It\u2019s actually bearish.\n\nThe reason is that most of the shorts, in my opinion, are institutional. Retail will typically short with OOM puts which don\u2019t cause much actual selling to hedge. Institutions short GME are going to have that in a giant account with a ton of other assets, so changes on margin placed on them, if indeed that happened, wont margin call them except in scenarios where GME goes up 20x in a day or something.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are a retail trader where half or all of your positions are GME, this margin change does effect you, especially if you were out on margin, and it makes it harder to buy more shares. I don\u2019t think many retail traders are directly short the stock.  Anyone want to raise their hand and admit they are 50%+ GME and on margin to do it?\n\nAlso, consider the context -retail brokerages just did this on the back of everyone here buying shares long. That to me suggests they are looking at customer accounts, seeing some over-extension, worrying about it, and setting the rule to prevent themselves being burned. Some of you have a net worth of mostly GME in your levered account. If that gets squeezed down and a liquidation is forced those brokerages won\u2019t be seeing the money.\n\nSo, I think the margin changes are bearish. I would also urge you bulls to not set yourself up to be squeezed, which is my next point.\n\n**Squeezes and Short Interest**\n\nIt\u2019s true that this stock has high short interest. There\u2019s contradictory evidence as to if the shorts went up this week or went down. IBKR share availability suggests it may have went down, other sources suggest up, and I'll update once we have solid post-Friday data that someone posts. However, just because the short interest is high, doesn\u2019t mean that it can be squeezed easily from here \u2013 Wednesday I think was that squeeze. A lot of the old shorts may have covered then, and we may be looking at new shorts.\n\nAdditionally, while GME longs here on stock are not squeezable if not on margin, those of you on OOM call options ARE squeezable, and those of you on ITM options are in a sense even more squeezable. OOM call options decay if the stock doesn\u2019t go up, and then the shares dealers bought to hedge the call they sold you get sold back into the pool. ITM options, when sold, do the same but more powerfully \u2013 selling a very ITM call option on GME means a dealer immediately goes out and dumps 100 shares of GME on the market. If you in turn buy 100 shares, it\u2019s netural, or if you buy a bunch of NTM calls, you might even cause a net buy. But, those will tend to cause selling if people take money off the table and as time goes on.\n\nAnd yes, there are a TON of new put options, and those get squeezed out too.\n\nSo there is a dual squeeze potential here \u2013 shorts vs their losses and borrow fees and decaying option positions which cause dealer buying, and longs using margin and longs in call options fighting time and also watching dealers dump their hedged longs.\n\n**Yield Enhancement Program**\n\nA pro tip I have for this sub is \u2013 if you intend to hold a ton of long stock that is in high demand by short sellers, you should get paid to lend it to short sellers. That\u2019s how the option dealers make a lot of their money \u2013 I\u2019m sure citadel is making a killing holding a ton of GME stock to hedge, and promptly lending it to hedge funds at 30% borrow rate, while having very little risk.\n\nMost brokerages don\u2019t pay you for lending your shares out, but IBKR does. Right now, if your GME shares are loaned out, you get something like 15% annualized in rebates. This doesn\u2019t work if the shares are in margin, they have be fully paid and settled, but it is a substantial extra if you are a long-term believer in the stock, and on other brokerages, they get paid instead of you.  If any other brokerages have this feature that are non-institutional, please post and I\u2019ll add.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI think the major factor here remains simply the desire of this sub to pile new money in. However, it\u2019s hard to maintain this volatility level and ever higher prices for more than a few weeks without additional catalysts because options are getting pricey and decay will set in.\n\n\\- The margin changes, again, are definitely bearish. How bearish? That depends on how many of you guys bought a ton of GME shares on margin and whether or not we gap down Tuesday. I don't think it affects the short interest much.\n\n\\- The option situation is probably net bullish Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday, but net bearish Friday (slightly)\u2026 but does mean that next week can be insanely volatile\n\n\\- Price moves are easier in the vicinity of $35, $30, $39, $40, and to a lesser extent, $45, $50, $55, $60 due to gamma 'ramps'.\n\n\\- I\u2019ll post new data when I get it", "author_fullname": "t2_2ksvu6ky", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "GME - Option, Margin and Other Factors for Trading Next Week", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_kyoixl", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1610823223.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610851140.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>TLDR:</strong> GME likely to be very volatile next week around $30, $35, $39-$40 especially.
