If you already bought BBY on accident this thinking it was BB or BBBY and need some reassurance, you're in the right place. First, going over my retarded investing tenets to make sure my dumb plays align with it: \n\nOverall:\n\n1. I'm a retard and don't know anything.\n\nBull Market specific tenets (if you're a gay bear move on):\n\n1. The market is undervalued, and \n\n2. Small businesses are getting crushed by governments to the benefit of big business, due to COVID.\n\nWhat's that mean? Stocks may be overvalued, but the entire market is UNDERvalued, so your own internal stock valuations don't mean shit. Ask yourself, \"where the fuck else would I put my money?\" If you put it in a bank, printer goes BRRRR and you lose value. The only option is real assets: equities and real estate.\n\nSo this play, another boomer ass retail chain, sounds dumb as hell when I say it. That means it MUST be good. It's a big business, which our government is bending over backwards to give free money to. Big stores have cash on hand, which smaller businesses it competes with don't. It has an online presence. Online presence sounds \"duh\", except COVID is forcing the move to online quicker than even a skilled executive could pivot. And COVID/WFH means they get to drop their unprofitable stores, employee benefits, and dead weight faster without any blow back from consumers.\n\nAll of this is even BEFORE I look at [BBY specifically](http://investors.bestbuy.com/investor-relations/financial-info/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=14535249). Let's get into it:\n\nUpside:\n\n* BBY has cash on hand, $5.1B to be exact (which doubled since COVID began, from $2.2B to $5.1B. See? What did I say?)\n\n* They grew online sales by 174%, AND store sales by 23%. They're being forcefully pivoted online, which is exactly what they NEEDED to do, so even if their leadership was dumb COVID has helped them. Additionally, every boomer is heading to Best Buy to set up their WFH setups with a blank check from their jobs that they can expense.\n\n* They surprised with an EPS of $2.04 last quarter vs $1.70 expected. Margins are only getting better as they can reduce benefits, track every minute of an employee's logged in time, and shut down stores / fire people without any public backlash due to COVID.\n\n* Remember how we all jacked off about GME console sales? BBY is BIGGER and sells more. Basically guaranteed revenue bump from this quarter that wasn't there last year, which will impress wall street because they're retarded like us and like when numbers go up. [The website has crashed over and over due to video game demand](https://www.pennlive.com/business/2020/12/ps5-xbox-series-xs-soon-to-be-restocked-online-at-best-buy.html). That sounds bad, but it's like with PTON being unable to fulfill orders... so many people want it that they're crashing the site.\n\n* They're still below their ATH of 123 from just 2 months ago and they've only been performing the same or better since then.\n\n* Most importantly in my mind, they are still undervalued because they didn't provide good guidance last quarter. Last quarter they beat every metric but the stock dropped from ATH of 123 to ~113 because [they said Q4 sales likely wouldn't be as high due to their high Q3](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/23/best-buy-bby-q3-2021-earnings.html).
