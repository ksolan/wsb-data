{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I initially wrote this as a comment but wanted to share it with the rest of you retards. There have been a lot of posts about GME this weekend but none have really gone into the implications of the [changes in margin requirements last week.](https://twitter.com/BooRileyMusic/status/1350159960877879296) This post gets long and rambly so up front **TLDR; retail shorts will be forced out creating upwards price pressure, but making the squeeze smaller and shorter** \n\n- The first question is, why are banks increasing margin requirements or removing margin altogether? \n\nThere are two possible answers. Either the banks can't find the shares or they're trying to protect themselves from potential losses. Not being able to acquire shares seems unlikely, if that were the case we should be seeing low availability and high interest [which just isn't there.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) People assuming banks are worried about their clients money are wonderfully optimistic but woefully na\u00efve. You can take your account from 100k to zero and the bank won't blink. What they're worried about is you taking your account from 100k to -100k. \n\n- The banks are protecting themselves. But from what? \n\nThe longs, with 75% margin requirement, would have to take 75% losses before losses exceed their collateral, and after that their losses are capped. For a GME bull that entered at 35$ that means a share price of < $8.75. **Shorts, on the other hand, have their losses exceeding collateral at any price > $26.25 (assuming 35$ price) and are exposed to potentially unlimited losses.** So banks are exposed to far more risk from the short positions than the long ones.\n\n- Banks are limiting their indirect exposure to shorts by restricting or removing client's margin. Why does this matter? Aren't most shorts institutional and not affected by margin requirements?\n\nIt's true, most of the short volume is big players, but there is a large amount of retail shorts as well. Not only will you have contrarians looking to capitalize off the correction, you'll have all the boomers and casual investors who see Cramer, CNBC, and SA articles predicting the fall. The assumption that most retail shorts are in puts I think is false. If you ask anyone on WSB they would probably make that play, but most retail investors aren't degenerate retards. Most are boomers who favor slow steady growth and get hard thinking about their 2% dividend from MCD. When they see Cramer railing millennials for taking some deadbeat stock through the roof, they log into fidelity or schwab and sell shares short. They're not on RH blowing their retirement on FD puts at 30+% premium.\n\n- Boomers short. Banks restricting margin. What happens from here?\n\nLast week we saw Schwab increase margin requirements first to 100% and then eliminated it altogether. Fidelity increased their requirements from 70 to 75%. Rumors are IKBR were planning to do the same. It's important to note that while removing margin does decrease bank's indirect short exposure, it has the possible effect of triggering a short squeeze if too many clients are forced to close their positions at once. That might explain why IKBR didn't end up changing their margin requirement on the same day as Schwab, and why these changes haven't been widely publicized by the banks themselves. So lets assume that banks take a gentle approach, progressively rising margin requirements before removing margin altogether. This forces some longs and shorts out of their positions over time as they become too high for the trader. But there's an interesting difference when the longs are forced to cover vs. the shorts. Say I'm long 200 shares of GME, 100 bought on margin. If the margin requirement increases from 75% to 100%, I can sell 12.5 shares and I now have enough collateral to cover the remaining position. If I'm short 100 shares with 75% collateral and the requirement goes to 100%, and I close part of the position with my collateral, my margin requirement will decrease but my collateral will decrease by an equal amount. **This means that the traders who forced out of long margin positions will only have to close a portion of their position while those forced out of shorts will have to close the entire position.** Moreover, given the recent price increase, it's likely that on average the shorts will need to cover more collateral than the longs. So shorts are more likely to be in financial distress and will have to close larger proportions of their positions than longs. The overall effect is net buying. \n\n- Short squeeze intensifies. Retail shorts forced out.\n\nAt this point in the lifecycle of a short squeeze with the stock running to new highs you typically have more and more short pressure- old shorts double down, new shorts see Cramer having a seizure and get fomo, some retard checks RH and sees a giant green dildo he doesn't agree with. This can potentially start the lifecycle over, if a new catalyst can force this new generation of shorts out. **By limiting retail shorting, big banks are effectively turning off the gas for squeeze continuation down the line.** \n\n- What does that mean for you? What do you do with this info?\n\nWhatever the fuck you want. GME will probably have some amount of upwards buying pressure this week as banks further restrict margin, the magnitude of which will be proportional to the volume of retail shorts. Combined with /u/unlucky-prize's [prediction](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyoixl/gme_option_margin_and_other_factors_for_trading/) of volatility due to gamma hedging, I'm betting it's going to be a hell of a week. \n\nPositions: short 35p 3/19, 35p 4/16, 60p 1/29, long spread 50-60c 3/19\n\nEDIT: Forgot \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nJust to clarify, I would love to give a more precise prediction, but I don't think it's possible without knowing the volume of retail shorts.
