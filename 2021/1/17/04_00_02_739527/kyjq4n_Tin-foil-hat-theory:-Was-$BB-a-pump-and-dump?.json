Something to help distract even a portion of a large group of users away from their quarry? Astroturfing is a real big thing, it's been used all over reddit for at least the last 5 years or so, facebook, etc. With the recent election wrapped up, I suspect these troll farms probably have a lot of availability for large firms who have a lot to lose. For just a couple million dollars, they could save hundreds of millions, by infiltrating this subreddit. And I wonder if they have? I think it's a safe assumption they know about us. Especially after the mainstream attention we're getting.\n\nSo that's the hypothesis. And here's some of my supporting ideas that I'd really hesitate to call \"evidence\".\n\nGME starts the blowup on Jan 13th. The very next day, the long dormant BB starts blowing up a little bit. I don't know when BB started getting pumped on this subreddit and I don't know where to find out, but I *suspect* that started on **the day** GME started blowing up.\n\nOn Friday the 15th, the day a lot of shorts have to be paid back in there was a massive push by brand new accounts, heavily pushing BB, and a lot of other things. A lot of \"fellow kids\" kinds of posts, every 10 seconds there was a new one. Most were filtered out by the mods, and a lot of them were down-voted quickly by people on /new. I'd be really interested in seeing some figures on this though, or maybe an opinion on how much more active Friday morning was compared to a normal day from a mod like /u/zjz for instance who I know was cleaning up a huge amount of garbage posts. \n\nTo be fair there were a huge amount of garbage GME posts too. But I'd like to think after a 100% gain over 2 days there would be substantial buzz here, and with the MOASS on the horizon that we ALL know about, you'd think that GME would be once again the only topic of discussion here. But it was far less posted about from my totally subjective, totally biased perspective. \n\nAfter hours on Thursday, BB was also pumped up quite a massive amount. This is what I see as the bait at the end of the fishing hook. But then despite all of the YOLO posts I saw on /new the stock continued to drop throughout the day, ending back where it started at the EOB on Thursday. I don't know how much it would cost to pump BB from $9 to $10, but I bet it costs less than the billions hedge funds stand to lose on GME going through the roof.\n\nSo I know this sounds nuts. I know I'm biased, and I'm trying to make sense of yesterday. But also, doesn't some of this align too well?
