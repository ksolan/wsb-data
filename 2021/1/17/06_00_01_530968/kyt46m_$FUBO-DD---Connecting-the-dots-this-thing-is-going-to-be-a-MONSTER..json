{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Pretty sure most of you know $FUBO has been shorted like crazy since the news of their Victory acquisition. It shot up 33% with the news and has since lost most of those gains. I'm here to tell you why the shorts are wrong and why this is a MASSIVE opportunity for us.\n\nFirst, I'd like to address the issue of profitability. It was founded in 2015and being a young, growing company and isn't profitable yet. To put things into perspective, even Netflix which was founded in 1997 wasn't profitable until 2003. Fubo has more competition today than Netflix did back then, but it's still growing rapidly. \n\nQ3 Results: [https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html)\n\n* Revenues were $61.2 million, a 47% increase year-over-year on a pro forma basis, or +71% excluding 2019 licensing revenue from the FaceBank AG business, sold in July 2020. This growth was driven by continued subscriber expansion, an increase in subscription Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and growth of advertising sales:  \n\n   * Subscription revenue increased 64% year-over-year to $53.4 million.\n   * Advertising revenue increased 153% year-over-year to $7.5 million.\n* Paid subscribers at quarter end totaled 455,000, an increase of 58% year-over-year.\n* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) per month was $67.70, up 14% year-over-year.\n* Total content hours streamed by fuboTV users (paid and free trial) in the quarter increased 83% year-over-year to 133.3 million hours.\n* Monthly active users (MAUs) watched 121 hours per month on average in the quarter, an increase of 20% year-over-year.\n\nQ4 Preliminary Results:\n\n[https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx](https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx)\n\n* Q4 total revenue is expected to be between $94-$98 million, a 77% to 84% increase year-over-year.\\* Prior guidance was $80-$85 million.\n* Paid subscribers at year-end are expected to exceed 545,000, an increase of more than 72% year-over-year. Prior guidance was 500,000-510,000 subscribers.\n\nIt smashed its previous guidance because sports and normality are returning. Also note that Fubo was still growing rapidly during the pandemic despite the lack of sports which is its primary focus. This is huge and it will continue to grow faster as sports start to return to normal. \n\n*FUBO* is estimated to announce *earnings* between Jan 25, 2021 and Feb 03, 2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of us know that Fubo was opportunistically  hit by short sellers (Kerrisdale/Rich Greendfield) as their lock up period expired. This made the stock tank considerably from it's high of $60. The short argument is that integrated sports betting is a pipe dream, and that its not profitable yet. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, it took Netflix a while to scale up and become profitable. At the rate Fubo is growing, they are going to be profitable sooner than later. This isn't even an argument to me, as they scale up a few things will happen:\n\n\\- Customer acquisition costs will become a lower and lower percentage of revenue.\n\n\\- Since they license their content, they need scale to turn those licensing costs to profit (just like Netflix did)\n\n\\- More customers mean they can charge more for advertising. (More on this later)\n\nFubo very clearly addressed the issue of integrated sports betting with the acquisition of Vigtory. The bear thesis is weakening significantly. Almost nonexistent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, on to the NBA:\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5)\n\n\"Over the past few years, Sky Media led investment rounds in FuboTV along with Fox for a 39% stake. This investment round was increased in late 2017/early 2018 with Sky Media holding Board positions. The former NBA commissioner was also part of the last $15 million round. Media has gone through some very big M&A shifts at the top-level with Comcast acquiring Sky and Disney acquiring 21st Century Fox. However, for FuboTV\u2019s formative years, the company was influenced by arguably the top sports betting company in the world \u2013 Sky Media from the UK. The Comcast-owned Sky Media is still a backer for FuboTV along with Disney.\"\n\nDavid Stern, the late former NBA commissioner was involved in funding of Fubo. The current NBA commissioner Adam Silver worked extremely closely with his mentor.
