{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I saw u/Unlucky-Prize post about the technical factors for $GME and felt inspired to make a post about the reasons why I\u2018m long this stock, which is the fundamentals.  I don\u2019t do options or techincal analysis so please refer to other posts for that info.\n\n$GME had been on my radar for quite some time but I finally dipped my toes in two weeks ago.  The basis for that wasn\u2019t the potential for a short squeeze or short interest but the underlying fundamentals behind $GME.  I had posted a long comment in a previous thread and will expand on that to explain why I\u2019m bullish long term for $GME.  I hope this helps.  This post is meant to be a personal opinion and not advice to buy or sell Gamestop.\n\n\ud83d\udc3b Case: \n\n1.  Digital sales will make Gamestop the next Blockbuster.  \n\nThe digital game sales argument, like all \ud83d\udc3b  arguments, are weak.  The shift to digital will possibly occur in the next console cycle.  So maybe the \ud83d\udc3b are right, but they\u2019re right in 8 years which means they\u2019re wrong now.  Additionally digital sales growth has decelerated and are returning to pre-covid levels as more\npeople go back to stores.  This trend should continue if the pandemic improves.  Additionally game publishers don\u2019t care about the fractionally\nlarger margins from selling digital direct.  They only care about moving as many units as quickly as possible.  If they could sell the games on floppy disks they would.  Go read the public filings for any game publisher and they will tell you that they only care about selling what customers want and guess what, they still want physical. \n\nBlockbuster died because Carl Icahn got involved, killed Blockbuster\u2019s attempt to pivot to a Netflix model by offering an online rental service and Blockbuster\u2019s old business model relied on late fees.  Icahn insisted that Blockbuster's greatest asset was its physical location and late fees, killed the pivot and forced them to triple down on their old strategy.  Carl ended up losing 98% of his investment in Blockbuster.  There continues to be demand for physical movie rentals as evidenced by Red Box locations and Netflix still has a few million dvd by mail subscribers.\n\nGamestop has also recently started to pivot away from software sales into other areas and now software sales now make up large minority of Gamestop's total sales.  They're pivoting more towards physical goods and not just Funko Pops but also plan to expand more into new areas like PC gaming and hardware.  \n\nEveryone knows that they signed a revenue agreement with Microsoft where Gamestop will get a cut of the lifetime revenue from Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.  This shouldn't sour the relationship with Sony or Nintendo.  If anything, Sony and Nintendo should be compelled to offer a similar revenue share agreement because Gamestop will inevitably push Microsoft products if Gamestop stand to profit more from it.  This will be a bigger deal in later years as console availability increases and consumers actually deciding to cross shop consoles as opposed to getting whichever new one is available right now.  Sony and Nintendo won't stop selling products through Gamestop because of this agreement with Microsoft, it's too large of a sales channel to give up.\n\n2.  Gamestop will go bankrupt\n\nThis is highly unlikely to happen.  Gamestop managed to survive the single worst brick and mortar retail sales environment in modern history and ended the year with a cash surplus of a few hundred million.  Now its the new year and the beginning of a new console cycle.  This console cycle should last as long as the previous ones which is close to a decade, plus or minus a few years.  During that time, they will be printing money hand over fist selling consoles, new games, used games, accessories, protection plans, etc.\n\n3.  Brick and mortar retail is dead.  Gamestop locations are shutting down left and right, this must mean they're going bankrupt.\n\nGamestop's average lease durations are actually quite short.  A lot of brick and mortar shops have lease duration lasting a decade but the average lease duration for Gamestop is just 2-4 years.  This allows them to close underperforming stores and open new ones very quickly.\n\nGamestop's saw e-commerce grow by 250% last quarter.  The company has been and continues to pivot towards a \"digital-first, omni-channel ecosystem for games and entertainment\"\n\n\ud83d\udc02 Case\n\nThis MOASS could be long and protracted like Tesla in all of 2020 as many continue to bet against Gamestop, instead of a sharp spike like Volkswagen, where Porsche played a large role in spiking the share price.  Keep in mind that at 1x sales, the share price should be $80-100.  Compare that with another retailer Chewy, which has a p/s of 6-7x.  Pet products also has a much lower TAM than gaming.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t even factoring in a complete turnaround that RC has to be planning.  Look at the newest board composition.  Newest members are Reggie (my body is ready), the head of cloud 9 esports, and the current president Petsmart and Chewy. board member.  Ask yourself, are these the people that would join the board of a company that is expected to die in 5 years due to digital game sales.  \n\nThis has moved beyond a short squeeze yolo to a long term hold.  If RC succeeds in transforming this into the next Chewy, you\u2019re looking at a 20x multiple.  This is based on fundamentals and industry tailwinds.  I added 10k shares weeks ago and added 20k shares at $38 because this thing is going much higher and idgaf about a few bucks in share price right now.  Also don\u2019t attempt to time the market because you could be left behind at the launchpad.  \n\nSimply put, if I told you there was a business that served a $200 billion total addressable market with very discerning and loyal customers with a lot of disposable income to spend on this market.  They have over 5,000 retail locations all across the world.  Last quarter, they saw Ecommerce grow by nearly 300% and ended a year where many other brick and mortar retailers went bankrupt with hundreds of millions of dollars in extra cash.  This company has a database called PowerUp consisting of tens of millions of customers that pay them a yearly premium membership.  They're starting a multiyear pivot into several new growing areas and have new board members that are industry leaders in each of those respective areas at the start of a new product launch cycle that will last a decade.  A young visionary founder who made his billions by creating a customer centric experience that defeated Amazon, who is well known to focus on one idea to the point of obsession, just became this company's largest shareholder and now controls the board.  I tell you this company trades at .5 sales.  Would you short or long this company?\n\n\nTLDR:  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 But not because of the MOASS.\n\nEdit: I forgot I had 5000 shares in my YOLO account so position is actually 35,000 GME", "author_fullname": "t2_3ahn5", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "$GME DD- Fundamentals: Why WSB Just Bought a Value Stock.", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kyyoa0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 221, "total_awards_received": 3, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 221, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1610865199.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610884074.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I saw <a href=\"/u/Unlucky-Prize\">u/Unlucky-Prize</a> post about the technical factors for $GME and felt inspired to make a post about the reasons why I\u2018m long this stock, which is the fundamentals.
