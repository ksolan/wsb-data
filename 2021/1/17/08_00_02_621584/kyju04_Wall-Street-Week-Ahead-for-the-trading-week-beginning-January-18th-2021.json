I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 18th, 2021.\n\n# **Biden heads into inauguration with a stock market tailwind - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/biden-heads-into-inauguration-with-a-stock-market-tailwind.html)**\n*****\n> President-elect Joe Biden moves into the White House in the coming week with the biggest stock market tailwind since a presidential Election Day going back to at least 1952.\n*****\n> According to CFRA data that begins that year, the near 13% gain since Nov. 3 would be the biggest increase in the S&P 500 between the election and inauguration if the gains hold. President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 8.8% gain had been the best, followed by President Dwight Eisenhower, with 6.3%, and President Donald Trump, with 6.2%.\n*****\n> Biden\u2019s promise of the $1.9 trillion relief package he announced Thursday is one of the reasons for the stock market\u2019s surge, and it will be a big focus of markets in the week ahead as investors handicap its chances of winning congressional approval.\n*****\n> The Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday starts off the week, and over the next four days several dozen S&P 500 companies report earnings. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Intel and Procter & Gamble are among the companies reporting.\n*****\n> # Biden will have no honeymoon\nThe $1.9 trillion stimulus package is at the top of the agenda. But there is also significant focus on whether his administration will be better at controlling the pandemic and rolling out the vaccine, as he has promised.\n*****\n> \u201cThis is the number he came in at. Where do negotiations go from here?\u201d Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, said of the $1.9 trillion package. She pointed to worries about a weakening economy, evident in December\u2019s retail sales data, down a surprising 0.7%, and weekly jobless claims, at the worst level since August.\n*****\n> \u201cYou could argue this is Covid-related and therefore what is most important going forward is to see the logistics of the vaccines, inoculations gain orderly momentum. That is crucial for the market,\u201d she said.\n*****\n> Krosby said the market is focused on the inauguration.\n*****\n> \u201cThey want to see it go smoothly, and that there\u2019s not any security lapse. The market absorbed the events of Jan. 6. The market looked ahead and figured out that at this point it was a one-off, and the market ended higher on Jan. 6,\u201d she said. \u201cBut always the market becomes much more defensive if what we considered an isolated event suddenly broadens out.\u201d\n*****\n> There will be heightened security surrounding the inauguration after a mob of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol while Congress was in the process of confirming the Electoral College vote. The House last week voted to impeach Trump for inciting the mob, and now there is concern about further incidents in Washington or at state capitals.\n*****\n> # Stimulus and stocks\nMarkets are also watching carefully to see whether Biden can bridge some of the deep divide between Republicans and Democrats, who now hold a thin majority in Congress.\n*****\n> \u201cWe\u2019re getting stimulus, and now the question is \u2018OK, you\u2019re supposed to be this great compromiser,\u2019\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Political strategists expect Biden will get his stimulus package but it will be trimmed down. Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, said the package could be cut to about $1 trillion based on the size previously discussed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n*****\n> \u201cDoes Congress want to have a bipartisan show of support after what has been an extraordinarily tenuous beginning of this year, to put it mildly?\u201d Mills said. He said the stock market should continue to do well because it is going to get stimulus spending.\n*****\n> \u201cD.C. is going to be there with more spending, or consumers are going to be there with more spending if they have the ability to get to a post-vaccine world sooner,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> Stovall said that if history is a guide, the stock market should do well with Biden. The average gain of the S&P 500 in the first 100 days for Democratic presidents is 3.5%, going back to 1952. For Republicans in the same period, it\u2019s been an average 0.5%.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 has also gained an average 11.3% in the first year of a Democratic president, but just 5.7% for Republicans, going back to World War II.\n*****\n> The stock market will continue to monitor the bond market, after the 10-year Treasury yield reached a high of 1.18% this past week, the highest since March. It since slid back to about 1.08% Friday after the weak data.\n*****\n> \u201cOther things are going on in the back room. Bond yields have moved up of late, and it was a change. It gave you a sense of how fast rates can move,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cIt might be a preview of what you can expect this year.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/NdqXqj3.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/78MvG08.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HogqBPe.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yPgkKR9.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/o6jTeP5.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7BeafeZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zGNf0yh.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MhhsYpF.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yhXOGJz.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1E2Rohq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a74UeZP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/a97ysV9.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/skrsU4T.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading: Leans Bearish\n\n> Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 23 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.81% by DJIA to 0.16% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last nine years. S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/67df4ce1594bee9748fb885a5316ff07/b5f21cb74511d020-c9/s500x750/218ed920ea1a67d95ff97fd05a5b9bbdf2454805.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Seasonal Soft Patch Ahead Starting Next Week\n\n> With nine trading sessions of the New Year complete, January and 2021 are off to a solid start. DJIA is up 1.26% as of today\u2019s close, S&P 500 stands at 1.05%, NASDAQ 1.74% and small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 are up a whopping 9.14%. These gains all point to and confirm the return of seasonality that we have recently noted.\n\n> Last September was weak as it has historically been, then October exhibited it historical tendency toward volatility while November and December were both positive, in line with typical seasonal patterns. A positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days are also encouraging indications that seasonal forces are once again tracking. We expect seasonality will continue to present itself going forward as extraordinary efforts are made to quell the pandemic and return to a pre-Covid, open-for-business, way of life.\n\n> Due to the reemergence of seasonality, we would not be surprised to see some market weakness in the second half of January next week that could persist throughout the rest of January and possible spill over into February. In the following seasonal pattern chart of January, the last 21 years of data for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been plotted with January 2021 through today\u2019s close plotted on the right vertical axis.\n\n> Over the last 21 years, it has been NASDAQ leading at the halfway point, this year it is Russell 2000. Other than that, the major indexes have been tracking their historical patterns fairly well. There was strength early on, followed by sideways action. Should the current trend follow historical patterns then weakness after the eleventh trading day (January 18) is possible.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c921e48e1e14dd8a61d2ad5cc18d7f94/f775f74bce597bb1-b6/s500x750/409599af0a5ca5a6fbb2ba71a5b1ead87d5852f8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # 5 Charts on the Democratic Blue Wave\n\n> One of the top questions we\u2019ve received recently has been what a blue wave may mean for investments. After the Democrats won the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia, they will now control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Our January 11 Market Policy Projections for 2021 gave some of the immediate and longer-term policy impacts of the Democratic \u201cblue wave,\u201d and here we surf the blue wave with some interesting charts.\n\n> First off, blue waves have not been bearish for stocks, with the S&P 500 Index higher 6 of the past 7 times and up a respectable 9.1% on average since 1950.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog-1.15.21-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We shared this chart in 2020, and it shows that historically, stocks do better if an incumbent president wins versus a new president in office. This makes sense, as a new president will bring in new policies and likely question marks\u2014while you know what you will get with a re-elected president. Remember, markets hate uncertainty and surprises.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cMake it all nine new Democratic presidents since 1900 to bring with them both the House and the Senate. In fact, stocks do quite well that first year under such circumstances, up nearly 12% on average,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMaybe investors shouldn\u2019t fear a blue wave after all.\u201d\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when a new Democratic president has brought with them the House and Senate, stocks gained that first year of their new presidency 6 of 8 times. What stands out to us for 2021, though, is the House majority is only 11\u2014the smallest for a new Democratic president since 1900.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-1.15.21-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Looking at all of the times the Democrats controlled the House (since the 35th Congress when it was Democrats and Republicans), the 11-seat majority is the lowest since 9 seats in 1879. Yes, the Democrats are in power, but this small majority will make it very tough for any of the more extreme policies to pass.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-4.png?ssl=1)**\n\n> Lastly, the Senate is split a perfect 50/50, which is again extremely rare. In the chart below we share the seat difference between the two parties. \u201cA 50/50 Senate coupled with only an 11-seat majority in the House, and it is safe to say we have about as close to a perfectly divided government as we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Detrick.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-5.png?ssl=1)**\n\n*****\n\n> # Rest of the World Catching Up\n\n> Over the past year, US equities\u2014proxied by the S&P 500 (SPY)\u2014have consistently outperformed global equities more broadly. As shown below, over the past year the S&P 500 (SPY) has risen just over 16%. That compares to 11.26% for the rest of the world as proxied by the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex US ETF (VEU). Breaking that down a bit further by developed and emerging markets, US equities have outpaced both emerging and other developed markets. While emerging markets (SPEM) are right on the heels of the US with just under a 14.78% gain, developed markets (SPDW) have lagged with just a 10.56% gain. So far in 2021, though, the rest of the world has been outperforming the US. Whereas SPY has risen around 1% YTD, VEU is up almost 3 times that. Emerging markets in particular have shown the greatest degree of strength currently having risen 3.87%. Meanwhile, SPDW has gained less (2.7%), though, it is still outperforming the US.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-ETFs.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the ratio of SPY to these other ETFs. A rising line would indicate that the US is outperforming these other measures of global equities while a downward trending line indicates underperformance of SPY. As shown, the longer-term trend has pretty consistently been US outperformance over the past decade but that has faltered at the tail end of 2020 and into 2021. In the case of emerging markets, the line has been on the decline throughout the second half of 2020 as the ratio has hit its lowest level in a year in the past week. The S&P 500's underperformance relative to other developed markets (SPDW) has been more recent as that line peaked in early September but the trend remains the same over the past few months with SPY weaker than global equities more broadly. That is further exemplified by the recent downtrend of SPY versus the All World ex US ETF (VEU).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-RS2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Small Business Owners Didn't Like the Election Results\n\n> Today's release of the December Small Business Optimism Index from the NFIB saw a large drop as the index dropped from 101.4 to 95.9. After a sharp drop in the wake of the COVID outbreak, the index bounced back nicely but now looks like it's really rolling over.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Chart.png))**\n\n> Not only was this month's headline index weak, but it caught economists completely off guard. While the index fell to 95.9, economists were expecting a drop to 100.2. That 4.3 spread between the actual and expected reading was the biggest miss relative to expectations in more than five years (July 2015) and was the third weakest reading relative to expectations since the December 2012 report.\n\n> Given the big drop in the headline index and the fact that it was so weak relative to expectations, should we be concerned about a double-dip? As an investor, we should always be worried about what could go wrong, but in the case of this report, you can probably wait for further confirmation from other data. The reason for the skepticism is that you could argue that politics plays a role in this report. To illustrate this, we would note that going back to 2010 (as far back as we have data) and right up through Election Day 2016, the NFIB only topped expectations 42% of the time. Following Trump's election in 2016, though, this index surged and has since topped expectations 63% of the time. Since Election Day 2020, though, the headline index has now missed expectations three times.\n\n> From a longer-term perspective, dating back to 1974, the average reading of the NFIB Small Business Index during Republican administrations has been 100.1 while the average level under Democratic Presidents has been 96.2. Now, that would make sense if the economy was also in a recession more often in those periods, but over that same span, even though the percentages are low for both political parties (<20%), the economy has actually been in a recession a higher percentage of the time during Republican administrations than it has in Democratic administrations.\n\n> The lesson to take from all this is that even if it's often hard to separate when it comes to business or investing (or a lot of other aspects of our lives for that matter), it's usually best to leave politics outside.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Survey.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/yhXOGJz.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DAPsqr2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR FINANCIAL COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/aC5hzkZ.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR NASDAQ 100 COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/zIQniHK.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 1.18.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 8.8% gain had been the best, followed by President Dwight Eisenhower, with 6.3%, and President Donald Trump, with 6.2%.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Biden\u2019s promise of the $1.9 trillion relief package he announced Thursday is one of the reasons for the stock market\u2019s surge, and it will be a big focus of markets in the week ahead as investors handicap its chances of winning congressional approval.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday starts off the week, and over the next four days several dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Intel and Procter &amp; Gamble are among the companies reporting.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>Biden will have no honeymoon</h1>\n\n<p>The $1.9 trillion stimulus package is at the top of the agenda. But there is also significant focus on whether his administration will be better at controlling the pandemic and rolling out the vaccine, as he has promised.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is the number he came in at. Where do negotiations go from here?\u201d Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, said of the $1.9 trillion package. She pointed to worries about a weakening economy, evident in December\u2019s retail sales data, down a surprising 0.7%, and weekly jobless claims, at the worst level since August.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>\u201cYou could argue this is Covid-related and therefore what is most important going forward is to see the logistics of the vaccines, inoculations gain orderly momentum. That is crucial for the market,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Krosby said the market is focused on the inauguration.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>\u201cThey want to see it go smoothly, and that there\u2019s not any security lapse. The market absorbed the events of Jan. 6. The market looked ahead and figured out that at this point it was a one-off, and the market ended higher on Jan. 6,\u201d she said. \u201cBut always the market becomes much more defensive if what we considered an isolated event suddenly broadens out.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>There will be heightened security surrounding the inauguration after a mob of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol while Congress was in the process of confirming the Electoral College vote. The House last week voted to impeach Trump for inciting the mob, and now there is concern about further incidents in Washington or at state capitals.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>Stimulus and stocks</h1>\n\n<p>Markets are also watching carefully to see whether Biden can bridge some of the deep divide between Republicans and Democrats, who now hold a thin majority in Congress.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting stimulus, and now the question is \u2018OK, you\u2019re supposed to be this great compromiser,\u2019\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Political strategists expect Biden will get his stimulus package but it will be trimmed down. Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, said the package could be cut to about $1 trillion based on the size previously discussed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>\u201cDoes Congress want to have a bipartisan show of support after what has been an extraordinarily tenuous beginning of this year, to put it mildly?\u201d Mills said. He said the stock market should continue to do well because it is going to get stimulus spending.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>\u201cD.C. is going to be there with more spending, or consumers are going to be there with more spending if they have the ability to get to a post-vaccine world sooner,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Stovall said that if history is a guide, the stock market should do well with Biden. The average gain of the S&amp;P 500 in the first 100 days for Democratic presidents is 3.5%, going back to 1952. For Republicans in the same period, it\u2019s been an average 0.5%.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 has also gained an average 11.3% in the first year of a Democratic president, but just 5.7% for Republicans, going back to World War II.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The stock market will continue to monitor the bond market, after the 10-year Treasury yield reached a high of 1.18% this past week, the highest since March. It since slid back to about 1.08% Friday after the weak data.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>\u201cOther things are going on in the back room. Bond yields have moved up of late, and it was a change. It gave you a sense of how fast rates can move,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cIt might be a preview of what you can expect this year.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr/>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1><strong>This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/NdqXqj3.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices for this past week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/78MvG08.jpg\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Futures Markets as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/HogqBPe.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/yPgkKR9.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/o6jTeP5.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/7BeafeZ.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/zGNf0yh.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a></strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/MhhsYpF.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/yhXOGJz.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Here are the upcoming IPO&#39;s for this week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/1E2Rohq.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Friday&#39;s Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/a74UeZP.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/a97ysV9.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/skrsU4T.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading: Leans Bearish</h1>\n\n<p>Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 23 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.81% by DJIA to 0.16% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last nine years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/67df4ce1594bee9748fb885a5316ff07/b5f21cb74511d020-c9/s500x750/218ed920ea1a67d95ff97fd05a5b9bbdf2454805.jpg\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Seasonal Soft Patch Ahead Starting Next Week</h1>\n\n<p>With nine trading sessions of the New Year complete, January and 2021 are off to a solid start. DJIA is up 1.26% as of today\u2019s close, S&amp;P 500 stands at 1.05%, NASDAQ 1.74% and small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 are up a whopping 9.14%. These gains all point to and confirm the return of seasonality that we have recently noted.</p>\n\n<p>Last September was weak as it has historically been, then October exhibited it historical tendency toward volatility while November and December were both positive, in line with typical seasonal patterns. A positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days are also encouraging indications that seasonal forces are once again tracking. We expect seasonality will continue to present itself going forward as extraordinary efforts are made to quell the pandemic and return to a pre-Covid, open-for-business, way of life.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the reemergence of seasonality, we would not be surprised to see some market weakness in the second half of January next week that could persist throughout the rest of January and possible spill over into February. In the following seasonal pattern chart of January, the last 21 years of data for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been plotted with January 2021 through today\u2019s close plotted on the right vertical axis.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last 21 years, it has been NASDAQ leading at the halfway point, this year it is Russell 2000. Other than that, the major indexes have been tracking their historical patterns fairly well. There was strength early on, followed by sideways action. Should the current trend follow historical patterns then weakness after the eleventh trading day (January 18) is possible.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/c921e48e1e14dd8a61d2ad5cc18d7f94/f775f74bce597bb1-b6/s500x750/409599af0a5ca5a6fbb2ba71a5b1ead87d5852f8.jpg\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>5 Charts on the Democratic Blue Wave</h1>\n\n<p>One of the top questions we\u2019ve received recently has been what a blue wave may mean for investments. After the Democrats won the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia, they will now control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Our January 11 Market Policy Projections for 2021 gave some of the immediate and longer-term policy impacts of the Democratic \u201cblue wave,\u201d and here we surf the blue wave with some interesting charts.</p>\n\n<p>First off, blue waves have not been bearish for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 Index higher 6 of the past 7 times and up a respectable 9.1% on average since 1950.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog-1.15.21-1.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>We shared this chart in 2020, and it shows that historically, stocks do better if an incumbent president wins versus a new president in office.

Remember, markets hate uncertainty and surprises.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-2.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>\u201cMake it all nine new Democratic presidents since 1900 to bring with them both the House and the Senate. In fact, stocks do quite well that first year under such circumstances, up nearly 12% on average,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMaybe investors shouldn\u2019t fear a blue wave after all.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when a new Democratic president has brought with them the House and Senate, stocks gained that first year of their new presidency 6 of 8 times. What stands out to us for 2021, though, is the House majority is only 11\u2014the smallest for a new Democratic president since 1900.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-1.15.21-3.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Looking at all of the times the Democrats controlled the House (since the 35th Congress when it was Democrats and Republicans), the 11-seat majority is the lowest since 9 seats in 1879.

As shown below, over the past year the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has risen just over 16%. That compares to 11.26% for the rest of the world as proxied by the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex US ETF (VEU). Breaking that down a bit further by developed and emerging markets, US equities have outpaced both emerging and other developed markets. While emerging markets (SPEM) are right on the heels of the US with just under a 14.78% gain, developed markets (SPDW) have lagged with just a 10.56% gain. So far in 2021, though, the rest of the world has been outperforming the US. Whereas SPY has risen around 1% YTD, VEU is up almost 3 times that. Emerging markets in particular have shown the greatest degree of strength currently having risen 3.87%. Meanwhile, SPDW has gained less (2.7%), though, it is still outperforming the US.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-ETFs.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>In the charts below, we show the ratio of SPY to these other ETFs. A rising line would indicate that the US is outperforming these other measures of global equities while a downward trending line indicates underperformance of SPY. As shown, the longer-term trend has pretty consistently been US outperformance over the past decade but that has faltered at the tail end of 2020 and into 2021. In the case of emerging markets, the line has been on the decline throughout the second half of 2020 as the ratio has hit its lowest level in a year in the past week. The S&amp;P 500&#39;s underperformance relative to other developed markets (SPDW) has been more recent as that line peaked in early September but the trend remains the same over the past few months with SPY weaker than global equities more broadly. That is further exemplified by the recent downtrend of SPY versus the All World ex US ETF (VEU).</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-RS2.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Small Business Owners Didn&#39;t Like the Election Results</h1>\n\n<p>Today&#39;s release of the December Small Business Optimism Index from the NFIB saw a large drop as the index dropped from 101.4 to 95.9. After a sharp drop in the wake of the COVID outbreak, the index bounced back nicely but now looks like it&#39;s really rolling over.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Chart.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Not only was this month&#39;s headline index weak, but it caught economists completely off guard. While the index fell to 95.9, economists were expecting a drop to 100.2. That 4.3 spread between the actual and expected reading was the biggest miss relative to expectations in more than five years (July 2015) and was the third weakest reading relative to expectations since the December 2012 report.</p>\n\n<p>Given the big drop in the headline index and the fact that it was so weak relative to expectations, should we be concerned about a double-dip? As an investor, we should always be worried about what could go wrong, but in the case of this report, you can probably wait for further confirmation from other data. The reason for the skepticism is that you could argue that politics plays a role in this report. To illustrate this, we would note that going back to 2010 (as far back as we have data) and right up through Election Day 2016, the NFIB only topped expectations 42% of the time. Following Trump&#39;s election in 2016, though, this index surged and has since topped expectations 63% of the time. Since Election Day 2020, though, the headline index has now missed expectations three times.</p>\n\n<p>From a longer-term perspective, dating back to 1974, the average reading of the NFIB Small Business Index during Republican administrations has been 100.1 while the average level under Democratic Presidents has been 96.2. Now, that would make sense if the economy was also in a recession more often in those periods, but over that same span, even though the percentages are low for both political parties (&lt;20%), the economy has actually been in a recession a higher percentage of the time during Republican administrations than it has in Democratic administrations.</p>\n\n<p>The lesson to take from all this is that even if it&#39;s often hard to separate when it comes to business or investing (or a lot of other aspects of our lives for that matter), it&#39;s usually best to leave politics outside.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Survey.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/yhXOGJz.png\">CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK&#39;S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/DAPsqr2.png\">CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK&#39;S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/aC5hzkZ.jpg\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR FINANCIAL COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/zIQniHK.jpg\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR NASDAQ 100 COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1><strong><em>Monday 1.18.21 Before Market Open:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY&#39;S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())</h6>\n\n<p>NONE.
