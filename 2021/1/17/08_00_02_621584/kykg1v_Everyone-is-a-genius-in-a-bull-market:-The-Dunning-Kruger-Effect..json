task.\n\nIronically this is incorrect. I know that this is also the common explanation (which is even more ironic) because it is not accurate to what the [paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Unskilled-and-unaware-of-it%3A-how-difficulties-in-to-Kruger-Dunning/f2c80eef3585e0569e93ace0b9770cf76c8ebabc?p2df) reads.\n\nThe Dunning-Krueger Effect is better understood to be a simple failure of metacognition. In short-hand: \"You don't know that you don't know something and you can't realize that you don't know it.\" Overconfidence is a side-effect but not actually the effect itself; self-assessment typically is overdrawn but the parabolic effect isn't as \"outlandish\" as popular media makes it out to be; for instance people who are just starting with options might say, \"I understand the greeks\" but then turn around and ask something that requires you to understand the greeks *but* that shouldn't be mistaken for the idea that people simply fail to understand that they *don't* know everything about options, hence the question to begin with, etc.\n\n[You are more likely to suffer Illusory Depth](https://ritholtz.com/2019/08/the-illusion-of-explanatory-depth/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheBigPicture+%28The+Big+Picture%29) in this particular case of investing in a \"wild\" market. Also, I would not consider this a \"bull\" market in the traditional sense; the number of winners and losers last year (that is, companies that literally no longer exist, not just companies that lost value) is astronomical; what happened with bonds and liquidity functions of other assets and such is not equivalent to a normal and steady rise in valuation over time at all. That's why there are so many saying, \"The Second Coming\" is coming for a fall out and honestly they might be right with the dollar being forcibly devalued. How long can that truly last? We don't know. We've never done this before in history. Which is ironic because again to understand these effects (this is a close cousin of DK) you'll make up stories as to why things occurred. What this means is also you can create [Economic Narratives](https://www.amazon.com/Narrative-Economics-Stories-Economic-Events/dp/0691182299) which turn out to be exactly what drives a series of interesting effects.\n\nWe can actually prove this; let's take for instance the Gamestop situation. So first we have \"the initial buyers\", like DeepFuckingValue, now the question is simple: Did he know that Gamestop would rebrand and Ryan Cohen would take interest almost a year and a half before it happened? No. So then, that begs another question; did the short-squeeze itself warrant these prices? No. Now, of course, in the history of the world we will write that *he did* and that there was no difference between the events that occurred and his state simply because it all rolls into itself very nicely (hence Illusory Depth with Narrative) into a clean story.\n\nThe reality is that there are people who make bets like this all the time *and lose* but we don't remember them. Another good story is the Ambulance driver who made a million percent or something; in that same thread there was a guy whose calls expired *one week too early* and do you know what? I remember the Ambulance Driver. I don't remember the other guy.\n\nWe can say the same of Tesla; everyone has an explanation as to why Tesla soared *after the fact* but no one expected this to occur in a single year and anyone who gives an explanation of it is practically lying through their teeth since the story itself of clean energy is 40 years old. There are many, many examples where things went sideways, make no sense, will be explained after the fact, or are just flat out garbage that people will buy into because they see the ticker and know that it will rise regardless of it's actual viability.\n\nTL;DR: **The greatest threat to you in this market are the stories you tell yourself not the knowledge base you think you have.**", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\u001b210108:3:1"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>The Dunning-Kruger Effect is a cognitive bias in which people with a low ability of a given task are prone to overestimate their ability at that task.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ironically this is incorrect.
