You wouldn\u2019t trust them with a pair of scissors and so you certainly shouldn\u2019t leave them alone with tricky finance decisions either. We are a family though - and not the kind that gives a retard up for adoption. \n\nWith that said, given the amount of shit posting about how a GME squeeze is bound to happen on Tuesday, I feel obligated to stress that in saying so, we are all setting ourselves up for disappointment. It is much better to chill the fuck out and be pleasantly surprised, rather than spend your days posting rocket emojis only to find out that Tuesday brought virtually no change to GME share price, while Wednesday actually resulted in a 5% decline.

And that for every WSB hype train, which made everyone money, there are ten which went tits up real bad.\n\nWhat is more, if you genuinely, strongly believe that Tuesday is THE DAY, you are more likely to end up being a paper handed little bitch and sell if things don\u2019t go according to plan. If you stop fixating on a particular plan/date, it\u2019s much easier to learn to be a diamond handed badass. Now at the risk of sounding like one of them r/investing twats, it is a lot easier to implement all of the above if you just buy shares.\n\nThrowing a few thousand bucks into ridiculous FDs for next week only to sell them at a 50% loss when shit hits the fan, really doesn\u2019t help anyone. The same people who will tell you that we will have an unprecedented infinite squeeze on Tuesday, will show you a VW squeeze chart and say that we\u2019ve had a big decline in price on a Friday before a long weekend. Well if it\u2019s an unprecedented squeeze, it will follow it\u2019s own path and the VW chart has fuck all to do with it. You believe these things because you\u2019ve been fucked by the system or a big company a few times you\u2019re hoping to fuck them back. It\u2019s understandable. You will only succeed if you\u2019re smart about it though.\n\nDon\u2019t throw money that you cannot afford, into risky calls that you will paper hand, when you can buy shares and patiently wait to be 10-100 times more rich WHEN THE TIME COMES. \n\nI strongly believe it will come, but I doubt it will be this week. Keep in mind that the flacid shorts, gagging on that tiny Melvin dick, are just as sure of a positive outcome, as us bulls, with our throbbing foot long towers aka the envy of the showers.
