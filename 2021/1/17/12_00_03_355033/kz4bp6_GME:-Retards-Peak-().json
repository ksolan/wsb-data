It is much better to chill the fuck out and be pleasantly surprised, rather than spend your days posting rocket emojis only to find out that Tuesday brought virtually no change to GME share price, while Wednesday actually resulted in a 5% decline.

Well if it\u2019s an unprecedented squeeze, it will follow it\u2019s own path and the VW chart has fuck all to do with it. You believe these things because you\u2019ve been fucked by the system or a big company a few times you\u2019re hoping to fuck them back. It\u2019s understandable.

Keep in mind that the flacid shorts, gagging on that tiny Melvin dick, are just as sure of a positive outcome, as us bulls, with our throbbing foot long towers aka the envy of the showers.
