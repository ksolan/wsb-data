You cucks need to read this cos this is the whole fucking thing.\n\nthis is also basically my magnum fucking opus so upvote retards. Dont give me awards, legit go buy a powerup membership for a year. Cant tell you to buy shares because we gonna get closed down by Suck Elons Cock somehow.\n\nim also not some fininacial advisor or whatever just read this and make your own conclusions degenerates.\n\nTLDR: GME DD sumarized, Margin doesnt affect longs the same way as shorts right now. Dont buy shares on margin though and get ready to supply collateral regardless. Short interest is up and some smart retards are on our side. Read the post to raise your IQ from 8 to 9 though. **\ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udf08s  mega fuk and even posting high level bear shit to scare us.**\n\nCompulsory 7 rockets so you autists dont start having a seizure or something:\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nBasically been seeing posts about \"blah blah margin this, short interest this, WS to clever blah\". Going to split this post into distinct sections but im no english degree cuck so dont expect any bear bloomberg  level shit or something\n\n# 1. GME is a fucking steal regardless of squeeze. Buy now or be left on a dying planet while we head to alpha fucking centauri.\n\nSo basically everyone here knows about Ryan cohen and his horsemen of the apocalypse coming to steal melvins lunch money. This man bought apple stock in 2017. Hes fucking rich. Hes also an eccommerce wizard, taking CHEWY from a measly 100k co-founded company to a $4 Billion company in 2017 at which point he sold it to petsmart or something. Its now valued at $40 Billion, granted anything eccommerce now gets money thrown at it like a stripper in a high flying strip club or some shit idk im a virgin so dont listen to me, so it may well be a bubble. Regardless the thing grows its revenue like bacteria doing mitosis on agar jelly \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nTHEY SELL FUCKING PET FOOD. the market for that is like what? $1?. Gaming is going to the moon and is basically recession proof because of how cheap game is compared to other things for how much you get out of it. Any bears saying that Gamestop cant compete with digital or with amazon. Ryan cohen already slapped amazons head in with a no name brand. Hell fucking do it again. About digital everyone here already knows, microsoft deal, Ryan cohen also mentioned the possibility of having \"Digital game exchanging\" or something, image below.\n\n[Online trade ins. It says online.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80](https://preview.redd.it/2ba9j5d2zvb61.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b6f3f26c3588fdb8cc779aee8a3b1ce42859f33)\n\nHe also mentions streaming, digital content etc and aside from all the digital stuff wants GME to move to a community centric structure where big stores operate with VR centres, Internet cafe, table games like Dungeons and dragons and  40k (rapidly growing somehow will boom post covid) and as we now might know due to this post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme\\_dd\\_buildapc\\_kiosks\\_coming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/)\n\nBUILD YOUR OWN PC KIOSKS. This is the literal smell of money. Go to your Gamestop to build your PC with your kid? Gamestop is already the goto place wher your parents go to get you your latest digital fix so now they can go build PC's and it cant go tits up?\n\n**Now for some pussy boomer talk (aka fundametals or something).**\n\nThe expected Q3 EPS was -0.84$ or something close to that. The actual loss was -0.53$ but boomzoids only talked about the revenue drop. No shit sherlock its closing all its dead weight stores.\n\nIn the holiday report I will talk about a bit more below, 11% of stores were closed and revenue dropped only 3%. Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5%. They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect. Eccommerce is up 300% over holidays. In Q3 they reported 800% to date. In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Online sales now account for \\~33% of Gamestops sales now. This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen.\n\nWe are still trading at 0.38 P/S at this price. The average P/S for the SP500 is 2.753. Massive upside on these two numbers alone.\n\nBurry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value. At the time intrinsic value was like $22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights.\n\nGME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss. Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying \"omnichannel\" at the speed of light. Yes the revenue dropped 30% but thats covid for you. As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao. The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too, as youll see in a crayon drawing later. The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge. Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get. Combine the fact that they share game pass ( a massive hit) revenue from the xboxes they sell, something no other retailer has, revenue could be sky high.\n\nNow I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading. This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life. How do you think I feel? My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences.\n\nHoldiay report was a bear trap imo, saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah. Lies. Comparitve store sales rose 5% and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops. When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated (Also in Ryan cohens letter) they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth. Gamestop realistically needs like 1/2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency. \n\n[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) this article the messiah himself wrote. In it he states:\n\n>At Chewy, we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money. The company-wide culture of frugality came from his example. Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth. We grew Chewy from $200 million in sales in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2018 while spending only $130 million in capital, all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers.\n\nManiacal. Thats all I need to say. The guy is going to get to mars before papa musk and he wont even break a sweat. When FCF starts to catch up to WS expectations every cuck analyst who donwgraded them is gonna get ditched and upgrades will start to happen.\n\nSo in the headin i said its a steal. That implies some future higher price target right? Well here is my guess for a conservative price target based on the information above and also some more I probably forgot cos im a retard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares \\(another reason shorts are fuk\\)](https://preview.redd.it/dehiug393wb61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=f198773c36d5109382eb2beba6fade3c059121df)\n\n>The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)\n\nThis alone means if for not inflation adjusted terms we reached 9.8Bn or whatever the crayon chart says we should reach:\n\n9.8/2.48 = \\~3.95   3.95 \\* $35.5 = \\~$140. The share price now to reach old mkt cap is $140 fucking dollars. Thats a 4 bagger from now. It gets better. \n\nfrom [statista](https://statista.com) :\n\n>Considering the **annual inflation rate in the United States** in recent years, a 2.24 percent **inflation rate** is a very moderate projection.\n\nIf we take 2.24% inflation, the this share price target in todays money means we should reach $182 because of $140 \\* 1.0224\\^12, = $182 in adjusted. Thats more than a 5 bagger. basically we could see $10 GME price from short manipulation and buying more is basically a lottery ticket!\n\nI really dont understand the bear thesis. The only bear thesis ( short term this one) was that margin would affect longs more but I looked at it on ortex and its basically bullshit. Buy shares with cash though dont use margin. Own your piece of GME dont borrow it. Bears just spout \"DigITaL\" or \"BlOCKbuSTER\" so much Ryan tweeted a shit emoji at them. All the bears think theyre clever. What the fuck makes those cucks special? How are they different now than the ones from $2, or $4, or $10. \n\n**Bears are betting against:**\n\nRyan fucking cohen, buisness legend CHEWY from 100k investment, now 40 billion\n\nMichael burry, Investing legend, predicted the housing crisis and is in GME since april\n\nu/DeepFuckingValue , the new WSB god chad, now basically a whale\n\nReggie Fils-Aim\u00e9, gaming and buisness legend, former COO of nintendo\n\nSenvest, a mega fund thats actively managed\n\nNorweigan sovereign wealth fund\n\nFidelity, Vanguard and blackrock own this shit and are never selling they literally dont give a shit\n\nAll of WSB has now formed a shield wall against the bears\n\nMicrosoft gave GME highly discounted azure deals and free office use for all employees and a revenue sharing agreement. Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome valid bear thesis left now (the only ones left) ----> Ryan Cohen dies.\n\n# 2. Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data.\n\nOk everyone on here and their cat, dog, bedbugs and wifes boyfriend  knows about the squeeze. Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it. Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space. The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1% of their fund.\n\nAlthough I know all you cucks hate shares, and hate holding, if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do. Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me. STONK ONLY GOES UP.\n\nThis squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood. Most of the funds where shorting this from 30-15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care. It all changed with 2 people. u/DeepFuckingValue and Dr. Michael Burry. These guys are as OG as it gets with GME. I think u/DeepFuckingValue may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself. Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train. Ive been in since $13 with 125 shares. If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok. Im merely a medium for this money made information.\n\n**The stats for this stock now short wise are, from ortex:**\n\n*Concrete* short interest as of 31 December 2020: **71 Million**.\n\n*Estimated* short interest, *January 11th data:* (This isnt predicted, this is from data in flow, has margin of error) : **77 Million**\n\nShort shares on loan 7 days ago: **50 Million**\n\nShort shares on loan *now* (This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis): 54.2 Million\n\n% of known float short: **147%** as of 31 December 2020\n\n% of know free float on loaned shorts: **108%** as of January 11th.\n\nSome [guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/) on here took into account extra buying on wednesday, Institutions, Burry, RC's extra 7% and WSB ownership (something so stupendously  retarded no serious firm will do it) that float on short could be in the 100s of %. Total short float now I would say could be **200-400%** if the numbers are correct.  This pisses on all other short squeezes. Some countries ban shorting above 100% cos of how autistic it is.\n\nThe recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday (remember  some guys are now buying lambos with GME money. If they held they could by 10), calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares. Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday. This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was **-10%**.\n\nGamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now.\n\n[This shows naked short selling and downwards pressure hasnt capitulated](https://preview.redd.it/xsetax08pwb61.jpg?width=1083&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=172439b81f509ba01ed3e6489671d6f009298e84)\n\nNeed rockets \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80:\n\nOk so now if WSB owns an estimated 6-8% of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls, we should be minimizing longs getting margin called. Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts \"blockbuster\" and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal **54 Million** shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more. Why? Because every long on margin is in the green, and now a true zealot/extremist/autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call. Shorts are in the massive red zone. How do I know you ask?\n\nOrtex data from Jan 4th 2021:\n\n[This is the data from ortex for short interest for Gamestop for Jan 4th](https://preview.redd.it/urqb3c3zbwb61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=d874cd908bad7fe3e8aa4486b5a294f5c1d5724e)\n\nSo this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66.98 Million shares. From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from \\~21 to \\~17 so shorts took profits. The shares on loan arent for longs too. This is all purely short data, and 47M  shorted at $17 this shows.\n\nThese shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared.\n\nNow for the data for this week:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ortex short data for Jan 14th for Gamestop](https://preview.redd.it/5ryumpl1dwb61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb80c09e1be7b2f36f6d3745983cef4ce2b2df9b)\n\nSHARES ON LOAN HAVE GONE UP.  BUT 87% OF LOANED SHORTS WHERE SHORTING AT SUB $20. \n\nCost to borrow is also up, estimated short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount.\n\nLongs on margin need to supply collateral, but we are in the massive green zone, shorts are underwater. Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs. We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day, so shorts can only short on the way up. Im not saying itll happen but this shit is skewed in our favour big time. we need to \ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/).\n\n**Seen a lot of talk about Gamma hedging and delta.**\n\nYou realize that the fucking bankers and brokers dont understand gamma hedging right? That shits up their with the black-scholes equation and feynman-kac solution. Forget about it. The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money. The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because **no one** except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit. The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out, but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market, and wow who couldve guessed it, like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible. That guy talking about Gamma , Delta and margin calls is on weeklies. Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us. Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother.\n\n**Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts, on to the options distributions**\n\n**Two images now: Top one is before the end of the 15th, the other one is after market close:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This shows the suspected melvin puts \\(51000 contracts, 5 Million shares, rolled up from july, strike price $24\\) and lots of big ITM calls.](https://preview.redd.it/t8odq9btgwb61.jpg?width=821&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61bb8a66e0ed83f0315921c295d1851a3c20c6c0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This shows the big put contract didnt get rolled over and the big ITM calls got exercised on friday. Large puts are underwater big timem while calls are in the big tendy zone.](https://preview.redd.it/3nqb33f0hwb61.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dc83f542dcc3565ae0424121146101b73cf0083)\n\nThese two graphs, show before market close and after. As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high. They expired worthless. Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money.\n\nSomething else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before (tens of thousands).\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \n\nWe are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts/calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast. This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop. There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin (without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash) then shorts are likely on more margin than longs.\n\nRegardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options.\n\n**Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others.**\n\nBear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time, but differences in free float change the share price differently.\n\nKodak went from **$2.16 to $33.2**\n\nVolkswagen went from **\\~200 euro to nearly 1000.**\n\nOverstock went from **\\~$21 to $123**\n\nBlue apron went from **$2.31 to $18** \n\nIve been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price. This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates.\n\n$1 now is 2.81% of the share price. Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages. So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest (This assumes no sell off and no new shorts, new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen) **$35.5 \\* 1.0281\\^77 = $299.** GME to moon. \ud83c\udf11 .\n\nThis shit can happen. Hold on.\n\n**GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles. Shorts never win and they wont win now.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This post right here I found months ago and got me in the squeeze from the honourable and valiant u\\/Uberkikz aka Rod Alzman](https://preview.redd.it/4ysv7bzclwb61.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=27ac6ac58b6366f81b53fa75966733b8a8d61d3c)\n\nBasically the crayon chart shows green (outstanding shares) orange ( short shares) purple (Market cap) and cyan (Share price). In 2006-2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest ( Like now ) Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price. \n\nThis happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned.\n\nNow we get to the best part. History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares, which have been decreasing since 2010. Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future, well ever. Ps5 and Xbox Series X. are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2. This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before. This shit has literally never happend, ever. Uncharted waters and we are the captain.\n\n**For the insurmountably retarded autists who think that the squeeze has happend look upon this and despair:**\n\n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpf6k/gme\\_gang\\_there\\_hasnt\\_been\\_a\\_short\\_squeeze\\_yet/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpf6k/gme_gang_there_hasnt_been_a_short_squeeze_yet/)\n\nIHOR IS A MEGA WIZARD\n\nIhor I quote:\n\n>**A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move**\n\nIhor Dusaniwsky is managing director of predictive analytics at S3 a firm similar to ortex. He told bloomberg that the squeeze hasnt happend yet and that this was long buying. If someone knows this shit its him. He was talking about the tesla squeeze in january 2020. He has access to resources we can only imagine. Barrons cut his comment that the squeeze hasnt happend yet out it was that fucking bullish. All the media ramming down \"Short squeeze has happend\" down peoples throats because bears are fucking scared.\n\nThe bots on stocktwits spamming bearish sentiment should show how rattled they are.\n\n**Conclusion: Buy shares with cash not margin. Hold shares forever unless RC dies (Shame hes a cybernetic demigod), Melvin bad, Shorts fuk, \ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udf08  posting bearish shit are doing weeklies for the second time after they expired red on friday, GME to $200 without squeeze, Ryan cohen a god, GME is still a value play, Good luck have fun.**", "author_fullname": "t2_e90drwc", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "(GME DD) One DD to rule them.

Been seeing lots of cucks writing small DD pieces of bullish or bearish shit. You cucks need to read this cos this is the whole fucking thing.</h1>\n\n<p>this is also basically my magnum fucking opus so upvote retards. Dont give me awards, legit go buy a powerup membership for a year. Cant tell you to buy shares because we gonna get closed down by Suck Elons Cock somehow.</p>\n\n<p>im also not some fininacial advisor or whatever just read this and make your own conclusions degenerates.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: GME DD sumarized, Margin doesnt affect longs the same way as shorts right now. Dont buy shares on margin though and get ready to supply collateral regardless. Short interest is up and some smart retards are on our side. Read the post to raise your IQ from 8 to 9 though. <strong>\ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udf08s  mega fuk and even posting high level bear shit to scare us.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Compulsory 7 rockets so you autists dont start having a seizure or something:</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80</p>\n\n<p>Basically been seeing posts about &quot;blah blah margin this, short interest this, WS to clever blah&quot;. Going to split this post into distinct sections but im no english degree cuck so dont expect any bear bloomberg  level shit or something</p>\n\n<h1>1. GME is a fucking steal regardless of squeeze. Buy now or be left on a dying planet while we head to alpha fucking centauri.</h1>\n\n<p>So basically everyone here knows about Ryan cohen and his horsemen of the apocalypse coming to steal melvins lunch money. This man bought apple stock in 2017. Hes fucking rich. Hes also an eccommerce wizard, taking CHEWY from a measly 100k co-founded company to a $4 Billion company in 2017 at which point he sold it to petsmart or something. Its now valued at $40 Billion, granted anything eccommerce now gets money thrown at it like a stripper in a high flying strip club or some shit idk im a virgin so dont listen to me, so it may well be a bubble. Regardless the thing grows its revenue like bacteria doing mitosis on agar jelly \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.</p>\n\n<p>THEY SELL FUCKING PET FOOD. the market for that is like what? $1?. Gaming is going to the moon and is basically recession proof because of how cheap game is compared to other things for how much you get out of it. Any bears saying that Gamestop cant compete with digital or with amazon. Ryan cohen already slapped amazons head in with a no name brand. Hell fucking do it again. About digital everyone here already knows, microsoft deal, Ryan cohen also mentioned the possibility of having &quot;Digital game exchanging&quot; or something, image below.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2ba9j5d2zvb61.png?width=414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b6f3f26c3588fdb8cc779aee8a3b1ce42859f33\">Online trade ins.

This is the literal smell of money. Go to your Gamestop to build your PC with your kid? Gamestop is already the goto place wher your parents go to get you your latest digital fix so now they can go build PC&#39;s and it cant go tits up?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now for some pussy boomer talk (aka fundametals or something).</strong></p>\n\n<p>The expected Q3 EPS was -0.84$ or something close to that. The actual loss was -0.53$ but boomzoids only talked about the revenue drop. No shit sherlock its closing all its dead weight stores.</p>\n\n<p>In the holiday report I will talk about a bit more below, 11% of stores were closed and revenue dropped only 3%. Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5%. They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect. Eccommerce is up 300% over holidays. In Q3 they reported 800% to date. In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Online sales now account for ~33% of Gamestops sales now. This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen.</p>\n\n<p>We are still trading at 0.38 P/S at this price. The average P/S for the SP500 is 2.753. Massive upside on these two numbers alone.</p>\n\n<p>Burry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value. At the time intrinsic value was like $22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights.</p>\n\n<p>GME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss. Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying &quot;omnichannel&quot; at the speed of light. Yes the revenue dropped 30% but thats covid for you. As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao. The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too, as youll see in a crayon drawing later. The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge. Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get. Combine the fact that they share game pass ( a massive hit) revenue from the xboxes they sell, something no other retailer has, revenue could be sky high.</p>\n\n<p>Now I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading. This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life. How do you think I feel? My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences.</p>\n\n<p>Holdiay report was a bear trap imo, saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah. Lies. Comparitve store sales rose 5% and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops. When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated (Also in Ryan cohens letter) they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth. Gamestop realistically needs like 1/2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890\">https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890</a> this article the messiah himself wrote. In it he states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>At Chewy, we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money. The company-wide culture of frugality came from his example. Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth. We grew Chewy from $200 million in sales in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2018 while spending only $130 million in capital, all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maniacal. Thats all I need to say. The guy is going to get to mars before papa musk and he wont even break a sweat. When FCF starts to catch up to WS expectations every cuck analyst who donwgraded them is gonna get ditched and upgrades will start to happen.</p>\n\n<p>So in the headin i said its a steal. That implies some future higher price target right? Well here is my guess for a conservative price target based on the information above and also some more I probably forgot cos im a retard.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dehiug393wb61.png?width=1552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f198773c36d5109382eb2beba6fade3c059121df\">The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This alone means if for not inflation adjusted terms we reached 9.8Bn or whatever the crayon chart says we should reach:</p>\n\n<p>9.8/2.48 = ~3.95   3.95 * $35.5 = ~$140. The share price now to reach old mkt cap is $140 fucking dollars. Thats a 4 bagger from now. It gets better. </p>\n\n<p>from <a href=\"https://statista.com\">statista</a> :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Considering the <strong>annual inflation rate in the United States</strong> in recent years, a 2.24 percent <strong>inflation rate</strong> is a very moderate projection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If we take 2.24% inflation, the this share price target in todays money means we should reach $182 because of $140 * 1.0224^12, = $182 in adjusted. Thats more than a 5 bagger. basically we could see $10 GME price from short manipulation and buying more is basically a lottery ticket!</p>\n\n<p>I really dont understand the bear thesis. The only bear thesis ( short term this one) was that margin would affect longs more but I looked at it on ortex and its basically bullshit. Buy shares with cash though dont use margin. Own your piece of GME dont borrow it. Bears just spout &quot;DigITaL&quot; or &quot;BlOCKbuSTER&quot; so much Ryan tweeted a shit emoji at them. All the bears think theyre clever. What the fuck makes those cucks special? How are they different now than the ones from $2, or $4, or $10. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Bears are betting against:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ryan fucking cohen, buisness legend CHEWY from 100k investment, now 40 billion</p>\n\n<p>Michael burry, Investing legend, predicted the housing crisis and is in GME since april</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/DeepFuckingValue\">u/DeepFuckingValue</a> , the new WSB god chad, now basically a whale</p>\n\n<p>Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9, gaming and buisness legend, former COO of nintendo</p>\n\n<p>Senvest, a mega fund thats actively managed</p>\n\n<p>Norweigan sovereign wealth fund</p>\n\n<p>Fidelity, Vanguard and blackrock own this shit and are never selling they literally dont give a shit</p>\n\n<p>All of WSB has now formed a shield wall against the bears</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft gave GME highly discounted azure deals and free office use for all employees and a revenue sharing agreement. Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Some valid bear thesis left now (the only ones left) ----&gt; Ryan Cohen dies.</p>\n\n<h1>2. Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data.</h1>\n\n<p>Ok everyone on here and their cat, dog, bedbugs and wifes boyfriend  knows about the squeeze. Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it. Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space. The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1% of their fund.</p>\n\n<p>Although I know all you cucks hate shares, and hate holding, if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do. Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me. STONK ONLY GOES UP.</p>\n\n<p>This squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood. Most of the funds where shorting this from 30-15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care. It all changed with 2 people. <a href=\"/u/DeepFuckingValue\">u/DeepFuckingValue</a> and Dr. Michael Burry. These guys are as OG as it gets with GME. I think <a href=\"/u/DeepFuckingValue\">u/DeepFuckingValue</a> may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself. Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train. Ive been in since $13 with 125 shares. If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok. Im merely a medium for this money made information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The stats for this stock now short wise are, from ortex:</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Concrete</em> short interest as of 31 December 2020: <strong>71 Million</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Estimated</em> short interest, <em>January 11th data:</em> (This isnt predicted, this is from data in flow, has margin of error) : <strong>77 Million</strong></p>\n\n<p>Short shares on loan 7 days ago: <strong>50 Million</strong></p>\n\n<p>Short shares on loan <em>now</em> (This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis): 54.2 Million</p>\n\n<p>% of known float short: <strong>147%</strong> as of 31 December 2020</p>\n\n<p>% of know free float on loaned shorts: <strong>108%</strong> as of January 11th.</p>\n\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/\">guy</a> on here took into account extra buying on wednesday, Institutions, Burry, RC&#39;s extra 7% and WSB ownership (something so stupendously  retarded no serious firm will do it) that float on short could be in the 100s of %. Total short float now I would say could be <strong>200-400%</strong> if the numbers are correct.  This pisses on all other short squeezes. Some countries ban shorting above 100% cos of how autistic it is.</p>\n\n<p>The recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday (remember  some guys are now buying lambos with GME money. If they held they could by 10), calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares. Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday. This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was <strong>-10%</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Gamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xsetax08pwb61.jpg?width=1083&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=172439b81f509ba01ed3e6489671d6f009298e84\">This shows naked short selling and downwards pressure hasnt capitulated</a></p>\n\n<p>Need rockets \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80:</p>\n\n<p>Ok so now if WSB owns an estimated 6-8% of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls, we should be minimizing longs getting margin called. Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts &quot;blockbuster&quot; and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal <strong>54 Million</strong> shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more. Why? Because every long on margin is in the green, and now a true zealot/extremist/autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call. Shorts are in the massive red zone. How do I know you ask?</p>\n\n<p>Ortex data from Jan 4th 2021:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/urqb3c3zbwb61.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d874cd908bad7fe3e8aa4486b5a294f5c1d5724e\">This is the data from ortex for short interest for Gamestop for Jan 4th</a></p>\n\n<p>So this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66.98 Million shares. From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from ~21 to ~17 so shorts took profits. The shares on loan arent for longs too. This is all purely short data, and 47M  shorted at $17 this shows.</p>\n\n<p>These shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared.</p>\n\n<p>Now for the data for this week:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5ryumpl1dwb61.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb80c09e1be7b2f36f6d3745983cef4ce2b2df9b\">Ortex short data for Jan 14th for Gamestop</a></p>\n\n<p>SHARES ON LOAN HAVE GONE UP.  BUT 87% OF LOANED SHORTS WHERE SHORTING AT SUB $20. </p>\n\n<p>Cost to borrow is also up, estimated short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount.</p>\n\n<p>Longs on margin need to supply collateral, but we are in the massive green zone, shorts are underwater. Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs. We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day, so shorts can only short on the way up. Im not saying itll happen but this shit is skewed in our favour big time. we need to \ud83d\udc8e<a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/\">\ud83d\ude4c</a>\ud83d\udc8e<a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/\">\ud83d\ude4c</a>\ud83d\udc8e<a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/\">\ud83d\ude4c</a>\ud83d\udc8e<a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/\">\ud83d\ude4c</a>\ud83d\udc8e<a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/\">\ud83d\ude4c</a>\ud83d\udc8e<a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/\">\ud83d\ude4c</a>\ud83d\udc8e<a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/\">\ud83d\ude4c</a>\ud83d\udc8e<a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/\">\ud83d\ude4c</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Seen a lot of talk about Gamma hedging and delta.</strong></p>\n\n<p>You realize that the fucking bankers and brokers dont understand gamma hedging right? That shits up their with the black-scholes equation and feynman-kac solution. Forget about it. The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money. The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because <strong>no one</strong> except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit. The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out, but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market, and wow who couldve guessed it, like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible. That guy talking about Gamma , Delta and margin calls is on weeklies. Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us. Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts, on to the options distributions</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Two images now: Top one is before the end of the 15th, the other one is after market close:</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/t8odq9btgwb61.jpg?width=821&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61bb8a66e0ed83f0315921c295d1851a3c20c6c0\">This shows the suspected melvin puts (51000 contracts, 5 Million shares, rolled up from july, strike price $24) and lots of big ITM calls.</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3nqb33f0hwb61.jpg?width=675&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dc83f542dcc3565ae0424121146101b73cf0083\">This shows the big put contract didnt get rolled over and the big ITM calls got exercised on friday. Large puts are underwater big timem while calls are in the big tendy zone.</a></p>\n\n<p>These two graphs, show before market close and after. As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high. They expired worthless. Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money.</p>\n\n<p>Something else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before (tens of thousands).</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 </p>\n\n<p>We are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts/calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast. This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop. There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin (without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash) then shorts are likely on more margin than longs.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Bear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time, but differences in free float change the share price differently.</p>\n\n<p>Kodak went from <strong>$2.16 to $33.2</strong></p>\n\n<p>Volkswagen went from <strong>~200 euro to nearly 1000.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Overstock went from <strong>~$21 to $123</strong></p>\n\n<p>Blue apron went from <strong>$2.31 to $18</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Ive been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price. This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates.</p>\n\n<p>$1 now is 2.81% of the share price. Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages. So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest (This assumes no sell off and no new shorts, new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen) <strong>$35.5 * 1.0281^77 = $299.</strong> GME to moon. \ud83c\udf11 .</p>\n\n<p>This shit can happen. Hold on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles. Shorts never win and they wont win now.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4ysv7bzclwb61.png?width=1199&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27ac6ac58b6366f81b53fa75966733b8a8d61d3c\">This post right here I found months ago and got me in the squeeze from the honourable and valiant u/Uberkikz aka Rod Alzman</a></p>\n\n<p>Basically the crayon chart shows green (outstanding shares) orange ( short shares) purple (Market cap) and cyan (Share price). In 2006-2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest ( Like now ) Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price. </p>\n\n<p>This happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned.</p>\n\n<p>Now we get to the best part. History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares, which have been decreasing since 2010. Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future, well ever. Ps5 and Xbox Series X. are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2. This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before. This shit has literally never happend, ever. Uncharted waters and we are the captain.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For the insurmountably retarded autists who think that the squeeze has happend look upon this and despair:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpf6k/gme_gang_there_hasnt_been_a_short_squeeze_yet/\"><strong>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpf6k/gme_gang_there_hasnt_been_a_short_squeeze_yet/</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>IHOR IS A MEGA WIZARD</p>\n\n<p>Ihor I quote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ihor Dusaniwsky is managing director of predictive analytics at S3 a firm similar to ortex. He told bloomberg that the squeeze hasnt happend yet and that this was long buying. If someone knows this shit its him. He was talking about the tesla squeeze in january 2020. He has access to resources we can only imagine. Barrons cut his comment that the squeeze hasnt happend yet out it was that fucking bullish. All the media ramming down &quot;Short squeeze has happend&quot; down peoples throats because bears are fucking scared.</p>\n\n<p>The bots on stocktwits spamming bearish sentiment should show how rattled they are.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion: Buy shares with cash not margin. Hold shares forever unless RC dies (Shame hes a cybernetic demigod), Melvin bad, Shorts fuk, \ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udf08  posting bearish shit are doing weeklies for the second time after they expired red on friday, GME to $200 without squeeze, Ryan cohen a god, GME is still a value play, Good luck have fun.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence",
