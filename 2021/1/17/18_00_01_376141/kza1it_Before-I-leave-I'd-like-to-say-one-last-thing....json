They're just putting away money they make into something with better  than banks, which thanks you for letting them make billions of dollars  with your money by giving you 0.001% of what they make with it. They're  doing fine for themselves and sometimes I wish I was more like them.I'd  like to state for the record that I was once one of you. Up 300% in  September off of TQQQ weeklies. It was fucking great. I actually got  back the 90% I lost on the Great Pump and Dump of 2017 (can't say which one, cause of the 1B rule, but it rhymes with Shmelios and Shmatheson) and then  some! I was going to be one of the few who turn 2k into 2M in a year, I  just knew it. I was picking out yachts already and I was *finally*  going to live my dream of starting a business. Had to do more research,  keep checking WSB and the financial sheets, have to find the next big  play.\u00a0 Which was GME of course. I doubled that again right as it popped  up to $22 in December, up 600% this year. Almost had my first 10k, it  just had to hit $25. Had to always check watch it, cause if you miss a  big move, you could miss out.\u00a0 So of course, my 25c'sexpired worthless.  Down 50% now.\n\nThis is where it  hooks you. You know you're right, you just have to give it one more go.  But you have to check your phone right now in case you miss the big  event. One last try, more money, you'll make it big. I bought 1/22  $20c's right before the ICR conference, it literally couldn't go tits  up. Just had to keep watching to see if what they say is good or bad.  Had to watch the stock too, to see how people react. Had to watch after  hours, cause someone might place a big order at 11:30 at night when you  can't sleep cause you're thinking about GME.\u00a0\n\nBut  they never did. They never presented. Down 75%. Maybe it was too good  to be true and the Tendie McTendface would never be mine. Didn't work  all day to watch the market until 3:50pm on Tuesday, decided I was done.  Can't do it anymore, my stomach hurts and I hate this, I'm out. 10:00am  Wednesday, would have had all my debts paid off and at least a small  canoe with the 35K that those options were worth. Now the dread and the  FOMO and the self loathing kick in. I'm just now pulling myself up  enough to say that I really truly am out.\n\nI  know I missed out big, but there's always another GME. I know it's not too late to get int. There's always people making money and people losing money. I could have bought Tesla at $30 or the electronic currency that shall not be named in 2011. And maybe  some day when I have a real job and less credit card debt I'll come back  and blow stacks on ARKG calls, who knows?\u00a0 But not this time. This isn't for  everybody. You can always make money, but you can't make sanity or time.  I know a lot of people on reddit are prone to anxiety and depression  and nothing triggers dangerous behavior like giving an depressed and  broke young guy the opportunity to solve all his problems by putting his  financial security, or lack thereof, in the hands of a largely  unpredictable market entirely outside his control. This shit gets  addicting real easily, and I applaud those who can handle it and make it  out on top, but just remember it's not for everyone. I saw a post where  someone was asking for help about trading addiction and got laughed out  for being a paper handed bitch. Don't be that guy.\u00a0\n\nPlease  just remember, this isn't supposed to take over your life. Yes, you can  make $100k a year if you're really good and all you have to do is click  some buttons and wait. Most people I know, if offered a job that paid  $100k and \"all they had to do\" was constantly be agitaed and anxious and  stare at numbers on a screen hoping you didn't make another stupid  decision you stupid idiot I hate you you're always wrong and you're  going to drive everyone away because of it... You get the point. I  wouldn't take that job no matter how much you paid me.So be nice to the  guys over at [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) and [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/),  they're just trying to do good for themselves.
