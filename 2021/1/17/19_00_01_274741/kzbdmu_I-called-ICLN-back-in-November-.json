The going concession seems to be about 2 Trillion in spending with anything under being lack luster and anything over as unrealistic. Arguably I believe that if this spending comes with little to no strings attached the number becomes irrelevant. The timing of the money could be crucial as well. Will it be a lump sum? Rolling investments? Or something else? \n\nTo those of you who are new to ICLN and are afraid of this recent pullback fret not. It did the same thing when it broke 20 and had about a month of consolidation (pre-election cycle when uncertainty was its highest). I can see a similar situation occurring but this is also not the same kind of uncertainty so I do not think it will take as long to begin its climb again. (Also worth noting last week was a huge expiration date for many options) just think of the upcoming news cycle. Inauguration of new leadership dedicating a decent part of his platform to renewables. He will be judged on the performance thusly. His first 100 days in office will define his motivation towards this issue. He will rejoin the Paris climate accord day one. (Show of good will more than anything) next he will rollback most environmental deregulation that occurred in the last administration. Then he will announce his green bill. Within the bill I believe that a high carbon tax, penalties for funding future dirty energy projects, and cutting big oil subsidies could occur.
