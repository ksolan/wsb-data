{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Alright listen up your all retards.\n\nI saw several posts about $NOK last week. It looks like since $BB is waking up, some retards start to lurk at others telecom companies. I saw an autist talking about NOKIA (Ticker: NOK), saying that it was a very autistic bet. I start to get interested into it. Here is my small DD for you fuckers.\n\n# History:\n\nOk so NOKIA was at one time one of the greatest company in the world, and leader manufacturer of mobile phones. They initially started with tires and rubber shits in the 19th century (!!!), then they went into telecom, bringing them at some point at the top of the world where they use to represent 4% of the total Finnish GDP by themselves. Everybody knows the fucking solid rock Nokia 3310 phones, the most solid phone ever made that you could throw from a 10 story building and still recover functional. I actually still own one which still works.\n\nIn 2007, they sold their phone manufacturing branch to Microsoft, because those motherfuckers wanted to step a foot in the smartphone market. They rebranded the name \u201cNokia Phones\u201d to \u201cMicrosoft Phones\u201d, and they fucked up pretty bad. Since the name NOKIA was not used anymore, they disappeared from the mind of people. And since Microsoft Phones were extremely shitty, Microsoft sold Nokia Phones to HMD Global, another Finnish company founded by former NOKIA employees. The thing is that HMD Global is paying a license to NOKIA to use their name again. Their phones are pretty good, essentially sold on the Indian market. So NOKIA here is just selling the name for HMD Global phones. They also plan to do it for laptops and tablets.\n\n# What does NOKIA do know ?\n\n**So the NOKIA that we are talking about does not make phones anymore (like $BB)**. They are however extremely active in the 5G market and pioneering the 6G transition. Since Huawei disappeared from that market in Western countries, **NOKIA signed at shit load of contracts with tens of countries and airports for implementing 5G networks everywhere**, just look at their Yahoo Finance page [NOKIA.HE 3.3525 -0.0300 -0.89% : Nokia Corporation - Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOKIA.HE?p=NOKIA.HE&.tsrc=fin-srch). Several months ago, they announced to have signed a contract with M**OTHER FUCKING NASA in order to produce a system for implementing 4G network on the Moon** ([Nokia selected by NASA to build first ever cellular network on the Moon | Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/))   S**O YES NOKIA IS LITERRALLY ALREADY ON THE MOON !!!!  I consider this as a proof that what NOKIA** is proposing  is of very good quality. Because they cannot fuck up that contract.\n\nAlso just last week, they announced to have a **signed contracts with Google Cloud, T-Mobile and the US Federal National Cybersecurity Center** of Excellence for their 5G Cybersecurity projects, in collaboration with NIST\\*\\*. SO not only NOKIA received the blessing from NASA, but also from the US Government !\\*\\*\n\n# The armed wing  of Nokia: NOKIA BELL LABS\n\nIn 2016, NOKIA acquired the Bell Labs company. You do not know what Bell Labs is ?\n\nListen up boys: **The Bell Labs is one of the most innovative company in world. Technology as we know it right now would not exist without Bell Labs**. The phone and the computer that you are using right now to read those lines and make fucking money with meme stocks used transitors right ? You know that the first ever transitor has been made in Bell Labs ? And the also the LASER ( the thing does light beams and pew pew in sci-fi movies) ? And almost all the telecom technologies that one uses everyday ? These guys have a shit load of heritage in telecom that no other company has. Bell Labs gave birth to an outstanding number of Nobel prizes. They are one of the company in the world who produced the most patents. And all of this now is embedded in the NOKIA Corporation. **This is thanks to Bell Labs, that NOKIA is pioneering 6G.**\n\n# Problem is: NOKIA is literally a GIANT\n\nYes, NOKIA is a well established company, with very low volatility. With their almost 5 billion outstanding shares, moving up this fat ass boy will require a shit ton of volume. They bottomed pretty hard last year when they announced a reduction of their margins in order to invest in their 5G technology. Since then, Nokia went up, slowly, but steady. I sincerely think that they cannot go lower, unless they fucked up their contracts. But since they are backed up by the US, NASA, and a shit load of other countries, I sincerely think this is very unlikely to happen. NOKIA will give its Q4 earning report next month, we will see what this could bring us. But I am expecting a nice catalyst here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE. THIS IS ONLY MY OPINION. DO YOUR OWN DD.\n\n**TL;DR:**  Ticker is NOK : A giant is starting a new awakening with their 5G technology, trusted by NASA themselves and the US government temselves. NASA is bringing them straight to the Moon. But the move may be slow.
