{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I've heard a lot of rumblings of WSB autists being the new market makers and us having control over the market now, but many of us may ask ourselves, is that really true? Below is a thought experiment to help quantify this discussion using the current example of GME. If ur retarded and can't read theres a TLDR at the bottom and a couple rocket emojis. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nI am the furthest thing from a financial advisor, don\u2019t take any advice from me, I\u2019m autistic and like to play out scenarios in my head while I wait for my tendies to cook.\n\nWe will begin with a quick history lesson on the [VW short squeeze](https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/). Everyone seems to compare this GME situation with the VW short squeeze but how similar are they? The short answer is that on paper they are not similar, but in reality they could be.\n\n-VW was viewed as high probability bankruptcy candidate, and as such had a short interest of 12.8% of outstanding shares in October 2008. **That's not a lot**. Short interest is the number of shares sold short (\"borrowed\") that have not yet been covered or closed out. Compare that to GME which as of 1/15 apparently has [138% short interest](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyp0q3/gme_short_interest_update_13808/?ref=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ref_source=link). So that's it right? Game over because GME has more short interest so its a bigger squeeze than VW? No, not exactly.\n\nSee, its easy to avoid a short squeeze when there are shares available to close the position, VW shorts could have easily closed out a measily 12.8% of outstanding shares since in October of 2008 only ~55% of VW shares were unavailable. At the time, Porsche already owned 30% of VW shares, Lower Saxony owned 20%, and various indexes owned 5%. That left 45% of shares available and only 12.8% needed to cover. **But then** under the noses of VW shorts, Porsche announced over the weekend that they had increased their stake by an additional 44% of shares, meaning that 99% of VW shares were unavailable: only 1% of shares were left and shorts had needed 12.8% of the shares to close their position. **Thats Bad and Thats What Sent The Shorts Scrambling to Cover**. Later that week VW shares peaked at 1000\u20ac. What is interesting here, is that the shorts weren't even acting irrationally, they were just unaware of the extent to which shares were unavailable until it was too late.\n\nNow lets compare this to GME. Previous estimates of the quantity of GME shares unavailable can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/?ref=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ref_source=link), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/?ref=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ref_source=link), and [here](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/gme/quote). For simplicity we will use Morningstar's estimate: GME has a float of 27.29 million shares, which means that all but 27.29 million shares are tied up due to insiders and institutions. So ~39% of shares are available, that's less than VW before Porsche upped their stake but with far greater short interest.\n\nNow here is when the thought experiment really begins, and we transition from a history lesson to math class.\n\nSo VW shorts got pinned in a situation where only 1% of shares were available but they had 12.8% of shares outstanding. GME shorts are in a position where 39% of shares are available and they have 138% of shares outstanding. So a short squeeze certainly seems on the horizon, but the ratio of shares available and shares needed to cover isn't as extreme as VW. **But what would happen if less shares became available?**\n\nWell if Ryan Cohen purchases the remaining 7% (~4.9 million) of shares that hes allowed, the shares available would drop to 32%, further polarizing  the ratio.\n\n**But this is what I want you to think about**. Float (shares available) does not account for retail investors because the consensus is that we are paper handed bitch bois and are apt to easily sell our holding. **What if that wasn't true?**\n\nWSB (retail investors) has 1.9 million members, if we all **hold** an average of 1 share each, the true shares available would drop to 29.4%. If we **hold** an average of 3 shares each, then shares available drops to 24%. With an average of 5 shares each, shares available becomes 18.5%. 10 shares each, only 5% of shares are left available.\n\nSo VW had a ratio of 1% of shares available to 12.8% outstanding (12.8x). Currently, we are sitting at ~39% available with ~138% outstanding (3.5x). If Cohen ups his stake we get 32% available and 138% outstanding (4.3x). To match the VW ratio, there would need to be ~10.8% of shares available with the 138% outstanding (12.8x). For that to happen it would mean that WSB alone has to **hold** an average of 8 shares per member to expect a squeeze of similar strength as the VW squeeze. \n\nHow far can this thought experiment go though? What if GME had only 1% of shares available just like VW did? Well, for that to happen it would mean that WSB **holds** an average of 11.25 shares, and that would get a ratio of, well, 138x.\n\nSo you guys do the math, is retail really in control here? It's looking like a maybe. To conclude this thought experiment I will present you with a hypothesis that will either prove or disprove this theory:\n\nIf retail investors can hold their shares and reduce the available float, then they have control over the market. (in this particular example)\n\nThe hypothesis is proved if retail investors can cooperate and act as an institution, taking enough shares out of circulation.\n\nThe hypothesis will fail if retail investors do not take shares out of circulation and have no control over the float.\n\nNow this is a thought experiment so I have to provide some realistic criticism for you to accurately judge the situation. Ryan Cohen has no obligation to buy the additional 7%, but the consensus is that it seems likely. WSB may not have 1.9 million users who are active, bullish, and dedicated to holding, and they certainly may not have an average of 8+ shares each, this is less likely but possible. \n\n**I am not a financial advisor, I am retarded like you guys, do not take this thought experiment as the word of god. Furthermore, I am not advocating that ever member here go and buy 10 shares of GME to force a squeeze, this is simply a way to explain the mechanisms behind the VW short squeeze and compare them to the current GME situation. Do your own research and make an educated decision on whether or not you believe GME is a wise investment.**\n\nTLDR: Thought Experiment: A lot of people have talked about how VW had a Porsche that made the squeeze so extreme and we don\u2019t necessarily have a Porsche. But what if this time... we\u2019re the Porsche?\n\nif VW squeeze hard cuz very few shares available and too many shares shorted, but GME only have moderate shares available and way too many shares shorted, then if GME only have very few shares available that mean GME squeeze hard too.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\u270b\ud83c\udffb", "author_fullname": "t2_2pw74w9", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Is WSB Really in Control?: A GME Thought Experiment", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kzbi6x", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 254, "total_awards_received": 6, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 254, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1610910111.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 1, "gid_3": 1}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610935902.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve heard a lot of rumblings of WSB autists being the new market makers and us having control over the market now, but many of us may ask ourselves, is that really true?
