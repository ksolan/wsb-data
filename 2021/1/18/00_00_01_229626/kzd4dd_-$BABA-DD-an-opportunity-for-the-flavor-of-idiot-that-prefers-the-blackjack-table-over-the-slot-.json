I got a job on a bank trading floor and will be legally unable to share tips after I get into the office. This is my parting gift to the community of idiots that sparked a fire that changed the course of my life.\n\nFucking Alibaba. This is an absolute juggernaut of a company that is currently plagued by every piece of FUD possible. Chinese government whipped out the cock & a centimeter ruler. Ant Group IPO hamstrung. Impending regulation. Jack Ma in hiding for fear of having his mouth cauterized shut. Down 30% from ATH. WSB mocking call holders who caught the falling knife. This kind of dark cloud overhang is exactly what I look for in my trades. There are always big gain opportunities, but comeback stories often have a lower floor than other highflying momentum opportunities (GME, EVs, SPACs).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*CATALYSTS AND OPPORTUNITIES\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**RELATIVE VALUATION:**\n\nFirst and foremost, this is a great company. This isn't some kind of \"I'm the smartest idiot in town\" play where you try and make a buck off of something worthless. This is a truly undervalued equity. Chinese stocks have been super hot lately. Mega hot. This isn't necessarily bubbly. China is arguably the strongest market in the world and the emerging middle class over there will fuel rocket-like growth for years to come. Look up Dalio's thoughts on China if you need to be convinced. Stocks like JD, PDD, BILI, BIDU, NIO, have all seen unbelievable rises. Money managers are foaming at the mouth looking for Chinese exposure. I don't blame them. However, after these astronomical rises, money managers will start rebalancing positions and looking for new opportunities. Cue Alibaba. This one has herpes currently. It won't have herpes forever. There's a black swan risk for Alibaba. It won't happen. As gains get trimmed in other Chinese stocks money will flow to BABA undoubtedly. The valuation is too sexy. It's been underperforming for reasons that have absolutely fucking nothing to do with fundamentals.\n\n**UM AKSHYUALLY IT'S A VIE YOU DON'T OWN THE STOCK**\n\nShut the fuck up. People talk about the ownership structure like it's a latent scam to defraud American's of 100s of billions of dollars. This will not happen. China needs access to US capital markets. This would singlehandedly destroy that relationship and hamstring China. Yes, China is the manufacturing capitol of the world. Yes, the USA is the financial capital of the world. We are mutually dependent. If this falls through, we all have way bigger problems than your $2000 call position. Market is fucked period if USA & China go nuclear in the financial markets. Nothing functions without Chinese sourcing.\n\n**INVEST WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT**\n\nCCP has a ownership interest in Alibaba. The CCP also came out and said that they want ownership stake in Ant as well. It's so transparent. CCP is pushing down Alibaba's value, seizing more ownership, then going to let it fly with favorable outcomes to the FUD that they created themselves. Do you really think China is going to kill something that is seen as the golden goose of Chinese ingenuity and progress? China wants to become an economic superpower at all costs. I don't care if the put Jack Ma in prison for life. This thing will continue to grow. Baba is bigger than Jack Ma.\n\n**HOLY FUCK LOOK AT THE FUNDAMENTALS** ***( skip if you're afraid of numbers )***\n\n30% YoY revenue growth. 60% YoY growth in AWS copycat. 900 million MAUs. FCF up 33% YoY to $6 Billion US. Increased share buyback.\n\nAnd the margins. Look at the fucking margins. 29% net profit margin for FY 2019. With 30% Revenue growth. AMZN's net margin is 4%. This thing is an EPS powerhouse that will continue to see ***bonerworthy*** FCF and boost buybacks. In my opinion, this is literally the cheapest listed stock in the world. Held down by FUD.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*FINALLY- WHAT MAKES THIS MOON?\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n**#1- Jan 20-** Joe Biden takes office. He wants to show all his friends how much cooler he is than Donald Trump, so he gets a patty-cake deal done with China. Fears about delisting subside. Institutional money gets braver. Black swan risk becomes more muted. I expect positive China relationship commentary to come out within a month of him getting sworn in. His administration will be much less hostile and unpredictable. Great for BABA & US/China relations.\n\n**#2- Feb 11-** Earnings. Earnings will be stellar as always. China handled Covid way better than we did and its economy has been chugging ahead at full stream. The great numbers will remind everyone how fucking cheap this thing is. Expect a pop if it hasn't already ran up a shit ton beforehand.\n\n**#3- Date unknown-** Resolution gets announced between CCP and Alibaba. It will not be as bad as everyone expects. This is literally a dog and pony show to show everyone how cool and strong the government is. Once that uncertainty gets removed, this thing flies. Same goes for Ma reappearance. When that dude comes back with his 1000 yard stare and says everything is cool, expect an instant pop in share price. There is literally every bad piece of news baked into this. This is where you want to be going long.\n\n**How do I play it?**\n\nShares are fine. I was long BABA shares, sold them to buy LEAPs because the pricing was so good. 40% IV not bad for the actual volatility I expect. I wouldn't buy calls expiring before the summer. Time is your friend here because of the situation and waiting on clouds. It has been trading in a tight range from 220-245, If it dips back to 220 I'm adding summer expiry 270 strike calls to my position which I will unload when it breaks out, letting my LEAPs ride.\n\nWhen this thing shakes off the bad press it will fly. I can see $400 before EOY, at which price it'll still be cheaper than its peers.\n\n**Positions: 2x 300C LEAPs expiring Jan 20, 2023, cost basis $6500, current value $8200**   \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zmxn6yd12yb61.png?width=1173&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e0602474177995e29d60835e172a5b3295defa7", "author_fullname": "t2_btmzl", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 $BABA DD, an opportunity for the flavor of idiot that prefers the blackjack table over the slot machine.
