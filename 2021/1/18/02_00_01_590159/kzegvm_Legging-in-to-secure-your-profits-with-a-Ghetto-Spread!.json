It seems like you'd be over managing your positions and you'd just increase the most fucked up factor in anything: the human. \n\n**Just sell strike right above it basically creating a Bull call spread** I think this is the only one that makes sense. For KERN, if you're up $900 and sell a strike $1 above then your max profit would be $100+premium, so probably idk $1.50 if you're lucky? So $250. You'd be better off just selling the original option. If you do this and the stock price increases and then \"sell the short\" which is hilarious you call it that because it's called buying to close you'll lose money because the price of the option you sold to open would have gone up as well. So either way you're losing money. You should just sell the original option you bought to open. \n\n**Sell the strike right below current naked long call and create a bear call spread** Well, if both finish OTM you would get to keep the premium. If the option you sold is ITM and your bought option is OTM you're gonna have to find a bunch of capital to buy 100 shares of the underlying and then sell them all for a loss. And then if both are in the money at expiration you'd incur max loss which would be the difference in the strikes - the premium gained.

You&#39;d be better off just selling the original option. If you do this and the stock price increases and then &quot;sell the short&quot; which is hilarious you call it that because it&#39;s called buying to close you&#39;ll lose money because the price of the option you sold to open would have gone up as well.
