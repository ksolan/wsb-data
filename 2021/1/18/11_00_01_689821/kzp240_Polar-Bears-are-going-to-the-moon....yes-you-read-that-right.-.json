But Coca-Cola drinking bears. I know, I know  \"Coke is a fucking boomer ass play. \"But I'm presenting an opportunity to beat r/investing and r/dividends  boomers at their own game with 200% gains possibly. Since the start of the 2021 Coke has dropped over 11% in a matter of two weeks on news of a new IRS tax case, JP Morgan downgrade, and just typical boomer panic. This dip will be bought up based off the **vaccine distribution, the legal case will be beat as the case is weak as fuck, fundamentals, earnings coming up next month, Stimulus news, and the fact that Warren Buffet has never sold a fucking share.** And as Warren says \"Buy the fucking dip dipshit.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Polar Bears drinking Coke before boarding the rockets](https://preview.redd.it/4aagqdydc1c61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=88ece0142ff101cc5873850051ac51e6dc1b8222)\n\nLets talk about the major thing that led to the downgrade and all hell breaking loose to start KO down 11% to start 2021.\n\n**The Tax case:** The IRS has gone back years and said that KO owes billions in taxes. If true, that could be a big hit to earnings. But the truth is this news has been around since November and was only just pointed out by a JP Morgan analyst who brought it up and spooked boomers. The tax case involves the IRS trying to get Coke in years dating back to 07-09 back when the tax code was different and did not apply to todays IRS regulations.... and this case can and will be won by any competent tax lawyer who points this outs and argues. At worst, it will only be a slap on the wrist. Also its coke, one of the biggest companies in the world and has a fuck ton of cash and resources to make sure their tendies don't get fucked with. The S&P 500 runs the world, not politicians, the IRS, or anyone else.\n\nJP Morgan also owns 3 million shares in KO stock which is bullshit.\n\n**Vaccine Distribution, Stimulus:** The pandemic hit Coke hard, a lot of their revenue is based off fast food chains, movie theaters, and sports teams. As vaccine distribution occurs more and more society will be going back to normal giving them more revenue sources. This pandemic also made more people buy coke products at the store and bring them to the house...hence after the recovery revenue from store products I expect to go up because people will be used to having Coke products at home. The stimulus will also give people an extra $2,000 and they will surely celebrate with a Coke product and send our call options to the fucking moon.\n\n**Fundamentals:** From a long term investors view point Coke is a great investment, bunch of products, we have a growing population, world's most recognized brand. pays a 3.4% dividend yield, P/E ratio just around 25. Long term investors aren't gonna let this dip without a fight and are gonna pump it. Coke is literally the definition of a r/investing wet dream. But as Wall Street bets autists we are gonna profit heavily off their 6% yearly gains.\n\n**Warren Buffet:** Our guy Buffet may have bought at the top and sold at the bottom regarding airlines like a true autist, but Coke is his signature stock and he lives and dies by that company. Him and Berkshire Hathaway own 400 Million shares in KO.\n\n**Earnings Run Up:** 2/10/2021 is earnings, investors are gonna load up on shares going into it, jacking up our calls to the tits in value.\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[KO stock....see it?](https://preview.redd.it/3rp74u58c1c61.png?width=226&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cc2bb3f97747e6eb08862711915138d42bcb100)\n\nLook at the chart fuckers, is your mouth watering yet?
