Here\u2019s how this is flawed:\n\nBlockbuster, for those who are too young to have ever rented games from them, was a retail chain that specialized in MEDIA rentals. Keep that in mind. Media could be a game, or a movie, movies being the primary driver with games being the secondary source. You young kids, imagine a time when your internet was considered fast at ~356kb/s because you lived in NYC and had access to DSL (not the kind of DSL your girl showed me). Your friends were stuck on Dial Up, and you would use message boards and AOL Instant Messenger, pissing your parents off with the monthly bills for data usage.\n\nBlockbuster was needed for those who only had a bit of allowance to spend on a game, but didn\u2019t know wtf games were out there except for game reviews. Who trusted reviews to preorder Cyberpunked 2077? I certainly did, but for the same price as a digital download, I got the OST on CD (bangs in the car\u2019s CD player), a box I can display as part of the collection, and a sick Samurai necklace I use as garlic to vampires who don\u2019t understand my style.\n\nIt goes beyond this. Blockbuster failed because the CORE BUSINESS (movie rentals) was eventually gone when people could simply download 99% of the store (including emulators for games they rented and owned physical copies of, scratched to hell).\n\nThere was no need for them. But do you want, or need a PS5? When your wife comes over knowing you have a badass gaming setup and two controllers, would I make her return a cute plushie she got me locally when she didn\u2019t even mean to buy it, but thought of me? How about the kids who have rich parents who tug them in and walk out with a bunch of niche but official memorabilia?\n\nNow here comes someone who\u2019s got kids and can\u2019t afford any of this shit. They wistfully walk around the store, and spot the used case. $130 for a 3DS used? Better than the jack shit my kids have... you got any used games for this?\n\nHere comes Richie Rich, just wants a new game and has no time for his old 3DS. Poor dad gets a bargain, Richie Rich doesn\u2019t give a shit as long as he gets a discount on the newest, and boom. You\u2019ve got GameStop being that arbiter of gaming merch.\n\nDon\u2019t even get me started on the kid buying up Pok\u00e9mon cards for a rare pull to sell on eBay. Point is, Blockbuster didn\u2019t adapt to changing times and didn\u2019t have products that could rotate to eCommerce (since they skipped on RedBox, now Netflix). Blockbuster didn\u2019t adapt because they had nothing to adapt with. Their product was a relic of the past. But since you can\u2019t download a PS5, or download an original game cartridge or merchandise for your girlfriend to see you wear, don\u2019t compare the two.\n\nBlockbuster at most, had candy for non downloadable items.
