And if you are interested I thought I should give you a bit of a longer explanation.\u00a0The data comes from actual securities lenders, companies that facilitate the loans in stocks. They submit their lending portfolios, ie how many shares they have lent in any given stock, as well as how many stocks are available to be lent, on a daily basis. The data covers over 68 000 lending portfolios and includes over $10 trillion in\u00a0availability with over $2 trillion worth of security loans per day. \"\n\nNote: *This is not the full e-mail.*\n\n3.\n\nAs OOminati1 pointed out, SEC Rule 201(uptick rule) has got triggered in GME and will remain in effect till Tuesday's EOD.\n\nAn explanation of Uptick Rule from [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptickrule.asp):\n\nThe 2010 alternative uptick rule (Rule 201) allows investors to exit long positions before short selling occurs. The rule is triggered when a stock price falls at least 10% in one day.\u00a0At that point, short selling is permitted if the price is above the current best bid.1\ufeff This aims to preserve investor\u00a0confidence and promote market stability during periods of stress and volatility.\n\nThe rule's \"duration of price test restriction\"\u00a0applies the rule for the remainder of the trading day and the following day. It generally applies to all equity securities listed on a national securities exchange, whether traded via the exchange or [over the counter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/over-the-countermarket.asp).\n\n4.\n\nOur guru uberkikz11 have [reported](https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann/status/1350151128294563840), IBKR and Schwab have increased or eliminated margin on GME and his source said that the source had been on hold with IBKR for an hour, and heard that margin calls ***might*** go out.\n\n5.\n\n[3 of the insider sold stocks worth $2.75M](https://imgur.com/a/jWWtW43)\n\nBut more noteworthy is the [stock sales](https://wallmine.com/people/8288/kurt-james-wolf) by Kurt Wolf on Jan 12(in the picture above) which was due to fund rebalancing(they can't have individual stock more than a certain percentage).\n\n6.\n\nAlso, I am seeing a popular myth circling around in the various posts and comment section. The myth goes: if you set you set your limit order high enough(some commenters say 50%, some 100% etc) your shares cannot be lent. I don't know how this myth came to be, but it is **completely false.**\n\nIf you don't want that to happen, just move your stocks to a cash account(does Robinhood allow that?) or call your broker. Although I don't think anyone needs to give a shit about if your stocks are shorted or not. Your broker and the short sellers are on the hook if they can't provide you with shares when you intend to sell the stock.\n\n7.\n\nLooking at the options chain, I don't think buying call options would be a clever idea right now. You may see a lot of people sharing their call options gains but those are mostly bought before the jump.\n\nI remember posting about PLTR once upon a time and PLTR slowly gaining almost 120-150%. Yet lots of people faced losses because of extreme greed (they didn't think that after a stock jumps 200%, it could face a pullback).\n\nYou cannot guarantee when shorts are finally gonna start covering. Or maybe they will cover very slowly, so as not to spook the market. Remember, they have more patience than you do. So, if you have to buy, buy shares(in cash account). I know most of you already took some profit (profit is profit), let the rest ride.\n\n8.\n\nPosting these short interests for the last three days. Hope you all find them informative. Have a nice day.\n\nTL;DR: Like my previous post, I still think GME will be a slow burn like TSLA(although you may argue TSLA's rise was pretty astronomical). Shorts don't want to spook the market so they will continue to cover their positions slowly but surely.
