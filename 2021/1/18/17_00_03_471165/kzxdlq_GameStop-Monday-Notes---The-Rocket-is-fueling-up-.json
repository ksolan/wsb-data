After my post on Friday explaining why that day's dip wasn't problematic a lot of things have happened. Once again, **thank to everyone for holding the line**!!! And also thanks to **everyone who keeps buying into the cause**. Stay put (aka don't press the f\\*cking sell button)... Keep in mind, that not only are we likely to make big dollars but we are also protecting 45,000 people who work at a company that was important in many people's childhoods - and soon will be relevant for future generations again. Without further ado, here are the updates regarding GameStop:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \ud83d\udcc5 A Summary of GameStop's moon mission\n\n***GENERAL INFORMATION***:\n\n* At this point we have many different investors that are in it for the long term (sorted by investment size): **Fidelity** (including their Intrinsic Opportunities Fund), Daddy Cohen's **RC Ventures**, **Blackrock**, **Susquehanna**, the OG u/DeepFuckingValue, and of course us *fellow retards* \\- among others\n* GameStop is still a Fortune 500 company which operates as the **WORLD'S LARGEST MULTICHANNEL VIDEO GAME RETAILER**\n* The firm has huge potential for expansion (including in ecommerce) as the **video game market is valued at $160 billion dollars** with an estimated **Compound Annual Growth Rate of 12.9%** (according to *Grand View Research).*\n\n***SHORT INFORMATION (Ortex Estimates; exact Updates not for another week)***:\n\n* *Estimated short interest*: \\~72 Million (decreased after spike but still up from 2020 EOY)\n* *Estimated short float*: still at \\~**101%+** (other estimates as high as 180%)\n* GameStop is still on the **SEC threshold list for 28th consecutive days**\n* Cost to borrow increased by an estimated 14.2%\n* Around 80% to 85% of shorts were likely shorted with a stock price under $20  \u2757 \u2757\n\n***NEWS***:\n\n* Jim Cramer acknowledged that the short busting seems to be working\n* Fidelity, IBKR and Schwab are confirmed to have eliminated/limit margin on $GME (heavily limiting short sellers)\n* Outgoing board members sold a total of nearly $20 Million dollars in stock on Friday sending the stock tumbling bc of the news. Having that said,  \ud83d\udc8e **\u270b s** saved the stock from a potential panic selloff\n* **Ryan Cohen Tweeted yesterday (1/17): Peanut Emoji & GIF saying \"So you're telling me there's a chance\".** The actual meaning remains unclear but many interpreted this as his confirmation that there is a chance for an infinity squeeze \ud83e\udd5c\ud83e\udd5c\ud83e\udd5c\n* Multiple sources have confirmed that PC-Building Stations are coming in near future (mini microcenter-style)\n* Uptick rule (SEC 210) is in effect until at least EOD Tuesday\n* **$GS2C (Frankfurt) is up nearly 17% at the time** of writing this DD (on a NYSE holiday)\n* Webull and Etoro disabled shorting $GME\n\n***OTHER FACTORS***:\n\n* There are talks about **potential margin calls** (which would strongly affect shorts)\n* Additional stimulus potential will increase the WSB meme buy\n* u/TitusSupremus DD post ended up on Reddit's popular page (with 300+ awards and 11k+ upvotes) making it inevitable for Reddit users outside of this sub to miss out on this. (This play has literally reached the Front Page of the \"Front Page of the Internet\")\n\n**News about GameStop seem to be never-ending. This renders technical analysis nearly irrelevant as well. Despite some major publications releasing a bearish outlook on the firm, the bullish signs are overwhelming**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \ud83d\udd2e Outlook over the coming days:\n\n* Expect yet another highly **volatile day/week on the market**. Be careful with options at the moment; shares are likely the way to go and will also help the cause more...\n* There is no doubt that the **potential for another squeeze exists** (maybe even a legendary MOASS)!!!\n* Even if the squeeze does not happen (for whatever reasons) this stock is an **absolute value buy**, as many people before me have explained here. Another reason to go with shares rather than options!\n\n**As long as idiots don't \ud83d\udcc4\u270b there is a fairly low potential for downside and HIGH POTENTIAL FOR LARGE UPSIDE on the LONG POSITION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \ud83d\udc3b Media Outlets, Melvin & other short sellers\n\nI feel like I am a broken record, but GameStop is here to stay. I know WallStreetBets will never change your mind but if you were honest you would go back an analyze past short squeezes.\n\nLet's take the example of KBIO's 10,000% squeeze:\n\n* KBIO was entirely defunct and insolvent unlike **GME which actually has an amazing opportunity in a fast-growing space**. The childhood memories of most American's and brand recognition alone play a huge factor. Plus, their subsidiaries are solid as well!\n* **Fundamentals don't matter in these situations**... it's a result of a variety of different factors that cause a short squeeze, and now you have an unprecedented influence: bullish individuals who will never give up - aka us!\n* Most squeezes undergo a similar sequence of events:\n\n1. Shares are **massively over-shorted** (over 100% is banned by some governments for a reason)\n2. **Big news regarding the overhaul** of the firm (happened with RC ventures buying in and overhauling board control)\n3. Forced **borrow recall** and/or margin removal (this already started)\n4. An actual squeeze happens as **panic breaks out** among short sellers - it's just a matter of time before someone starts folding (BTW, doubling down is a horrible bet and has barely ever gone well after a squeeze)\n\n* News Outlets and analysts tend to focus on patterns or traditional methods of pricing stocks. There is no way to say that this will be a good stock to short and therefore short selling downside far outweighs the upside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EASY TO SHORT does not mean EASY TO COVER. Now it's time to realize that SHORTING THIS STOCK WAS A HORRIBLE IDEA and in fact STILL IS A HORRIBLE IDEA. For institutional and retail short sellers alike: you may see the same consequences as $KBIO short sellers did - many of which went bankrupt. LONG POSITIONS are the way to go.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: For everyone who is new to this, please be aware that options have low impact on share prices and that volatility (among many other things) plays a huge factor in your trades. Be careful with your trades and always do your own due diligence. This is for educational purposes only.\n\nPS: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nPPS: Now would be the perfect time for an announcement by GME for future plans.
