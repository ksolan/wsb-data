The answer is yes. \n\nInterviewer: Could you give us a hint as to why that might come to pass? \n\nGrandpa: Because so many people are in it; and the frenzy is so great; and the systems of management - the reward systems are so foolish that I don't think it's gonna work at all. I think the returns will go down, yes. In real terms: the returns will be lower. \n\nInterviewer: What do you think of the combination of (quantitative easing + large fiscal deficit), and where is it gonna lead us?\n\nGrandpa: For that I've got a very simple answer: and that is - it's one of the most interesting questions that anybody could ask. We're in very uncharted waters. Nobody has gotten by with the kind of money-printing we're doing now, for a very extended period without some trouble. And I think we're very near to the edge of \"playing with fire.\"\n\nInterviewer: What do you think about how much we've expanded the money supply; how low the interests are; and how little the initial response there's been on...\n\nGrandpa: ...\"Remarkable\" is not too strong a word. \"Astounding\" would be more like it. \n\nInterviewer: I will let you choose the adjective, Charlie. \n\nGrandpa: It's \"unbelievably\" \"extreme\". Some European Government borrowed money reasonably for some little fraction of 1% for 100 YEARS. Now that is weird. What kind of lunatic would loan money to a European Government for a 100 years for less than 1% ? \n\nInterviewer: [Struggles to frame question] So can I ask you a question that falls out from this, from a different perspective - which is that for a lot of time, a lot of the policy-making in the world was because capital is scarce. Since World War 2 we're creating wealth at a very very high rate. Have the rules changed to some extent because in some sense the developed economies are just very wealthy?\n\nGrandpa: Well, of course it's changed to some extent because the developing economies are very wealthy. It's changed enormously. In my lifetime, advanced-civilization has gotten ahead faster than any century that existed before. Nothing else comes even close. It's utterly without precedence in real terms. It's unbelievable because I watched the whole damn thing practically because I lived so long. And it's been absolutely astounding. I can remember having 5 course dinner in Omaha for 60 cents when I was little boy.
