The Indian economy is growing 8% a year which is 2% greater than the US economy year over year. The entire infrastructure in Indian is still being built, so the country hasn't even really started its industrial revolution. This means its established companies have a lot of room to grow with an emerging market of 1BILLION people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$TTM was my safest bet, but it already started its climb thanks to Tesla. In the last two weeks alone $TTM climbed from 11.50 to 18. They are a car company that is moving into the EV landscape and will likely be Tesla's main competitor in India. The main advantage they have is existing relationships with the Indian state governments. Government contracts in India are extremely important because each state has its own cultural identity. They don't conform to the popular culture of Delhi and are actually more likely to give there business to a company like Tata Motors. This gives TTM a huge advantage since it has contracts in the southern Indian states (most recently Kerala). If companies like XPev and Nio have sustainable interest Tata Motors should be a clear favorite. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe company I am most interested in is Wipro ($WIT). This is an information technology company worth billions. They had been struggling for years before 2020, when they replaced their CEO with a much more aggressive executive office. Since then their growth as been apparent and they are taking a more revenue driven approach. Now why would this company trading at under $7 a share have value? Well 80% of this companies revenue is currently in North America and Europe. That means this Indian company has NOT even tapped its own market. That is about to change, starting in April Wipro is taking over the Indian locations of a German company Metro AG. This deal was worth 700million when signed, but does not actually take affect for a couple of months. That means the current 6.4 stock value will rocket in about 4 months. This takeover is the start of Wipro having regional monopolies in Indian, something that is not heavily legislated in their country. The stock has mid term growth protentional and June options for this company are currently really cheap. Its not an overnight gain like GME, but this one should pay off as the US economy may start to falter.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am currently in on both of these and $INFY for shares and calls.
