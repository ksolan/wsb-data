This research is compiled, disseminated, and reviewed, and actioned in real-time which is why attention is picking up. \n\nWe are fundamentally disadvantaged hedge fund and to the dismay of the existing financial community we are actually winning. \n\nCramer \u2013 giving the shifting demographics, I highly suggest you incorporate more rocket emoji\u2019s into Mad Money or let us sponsor our own segment.   \n\n**GME Short Squeeze**\n\n**1. Why can insider purchases/sales move the market** \n\nCompany insiders generally posses more knowledge of a company and when they buy it\u2019s a signal the share price is undervalued and when the sell its overvalued. Capital is a scarce resource and directors of companies are human (or some kind of reptile, robot, human hybrids) and they need money to service their lifestyles. \n\nIn WSB terms, if you are yolo\u2019ing funds for a down payment on your house (or to buy a much nicer house with a lambo in the driveway) do you realize your gains when you hit your goal? This can be a prudent financial decision to satisfy a basic human need (shelter and Lambo\u2019s) and isn\u2019t always a signal that you think the real estate market and Lambo\u2019s are better long-term investments than the stock market. \n\nInsider trades are a potential signal only.  \n\n**2. What happened last week.** \n\nFrom 08Jan2021 close to 14Jan2021 close GME increased 126% from $17.69 to $39.91 (ignoring intraday highs) with the gains partially retreating on 15Jan2021 to $35.50 resulting in a 1-week gain of 101%.    \n\nAs per media, the pre-market 11Jan2021 SEC filing with Cohen assuming 3-board seats (Cohen and his 2 Chewy pals Alan Attal and Jim Grube) spurred and increase in retail demand and set off a short squeeze with the Friday declines due to the sale of 810,000 indirectly controlled shares by director James Wolf. \n\nMedia is partially correct in that the Ryan Cohen filing resulting in a material increase in retail investment and drove up the share price, however it wasn\u2019t a short squeeze. The combination of the increased demand and the precariously low float set off a gamma squeeze, which further exacerbating the upwards price movement. \n\nThe James Wolf divestiture for any other company should have been relatively neutral news and should not have resulted in the Friday declines \u2013 these shares were indirectly owned shares by Hestia Capital Partners, LP with the sale to adhere to the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of Hestia Capital. James Wolf and his wife personally own 50,689 shares (unchanged). James Wolf is on the board due to a proxy battle that goes back to 2019 and it is well covered on pages 13-15 of the 2020 Proxy Statement and is worth a quick read ([https://news.gamestop.com/node/17701/html#toc878410\\_6](https://news.gamestop.com/node/17701/html#toc878410_6)). \n\nAs a result, the Friday market reaction is very peculiar. If you manage a portfolio\u2019s for others and the maximum single stock exposure that can be held is 10% for example with that stock increasing in value more than other positions, you need to reduce the exposure and rebalance to be within the investor policy statement thresholds otherwise it\u2019s a breach of fiduciary duty. Majority of the disposal was on 12Jan2021 at share price of $19.99 with the remaining 11% (90,000 shares) sold on 13Jan2021 were at $31.08. The requirement to rebalance came before the price spike this week and James\u2019s clients missed out on 50% one day gains.\n\nAdditional insider sales were noted on 15Jan2020 post market by the outgoing directors (not nominated for the 2021 Director Slate) as follows: Lizabeth Dunn (5,000 shares or 8.03% of holdings at $31.34), Raul Fernandez (34,619 shares or 51.36% of holdings at $35.27 average), Kathy Vrabeck (50,000 shares or 38.60% of holdings at $27.99). This represents an additional 89,619 in shares sold by outgoing directors and would be relatively normal given. This should cause an additional market decline on Tuesday absent any other information, however as above these trades should be relatively neutral signals and likely would have occurred with or without a price run up during the week.  \n\nWhat is currently missing is additional filings for additional share acquisitions of Ryan Cohen, Alan Attal, and Jim Grube that will be forthcoming in the coming weeks and would displace the \\~900,000 shares divested above. \n\n**3. What is a Gamma Squeeze**\n\nThis is going to be an oversimplification, as to understand a Gamma squeeze you need to understand the math behind option\u2019s and the role of Market Makers (\u201cMM\u201d). I am going to keep things simple and only focus on the key points as this has already played out.   \n\n**Delta**: measures the impact of change of the underlying asset. Hopefully you retards understand what a share is and if the share price goes up $1 the price of the share will also go up $1 and shares have a delta of 1. The delta on options will constantly change as the price changes (this is measured by Gamma below), however what is important is that far out of the money options have a delta closer to 0 and deep in the money options have a delta closer to 1 (or -1 if they are puts). Hypothetical example: a call option that as a current delta of 0.7 will go up $0.70 in price for a $1 increase in the share price, as the share price increased the delta will also increase to say 0.71 and then 0.72 and so on. \n\n**Gamma**: measures the rate of change of Delta. This measures how much the delta will increase with every increase in the share price and will be the highest when the options are at the money. \n\n**Market Makers**: the MM\u2019s trade for their own account and make money based on bid-ask spreads (stock and options) and will look to be delta neutral. MM\u2019s create most of the liquidity in the stock market.  \n\nWith that out of the way, what happened with the gamma squeeze?  Well, this is thanks to our friends at Melvin Capital Management LP (\u201cMelvin\u201d) who is well know and documented to death on this boards. As a special thanks to Melvin we should chip in with $100 when they set up their Go Fund Me account next week as none of this would be possible without their assistance. Cole\u2019s notes are below.  \n\nMelvin\u2019s most recent filing dated 16Nov2020 disclosed a position of 54,000 put options and has been documented that the open interest was on 15Jan2021 24p.  ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F\\_X01/infotable.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml))  \n\nThe Put options would have allowed Melvin to sell 5,400,000 shares (7.83% of total GME shares) at $24 to a \n\nMM. The MM would have hedged the delta on this position by selling shares short. As the puts went from ITM to ATM to OTM, the market make would have continued to manage a delta neutral position through buying the stock (covering shorts), buying back puts, or buying calls all which would have created positive price pressure.  \n\nCohen\u2019s board appointments set everything in motion, share price started spiking, and to remain delta-neutral the MM\u2019s exacerbated the upside price movements as above (due to the changes in delta). Positive price movements and FOMO on a short squeeze continued to drive up the price (especially with WSB buying deep OTM options and volatility spiking). This defines the price movements on 13Jan2021 the previous downward pressure of the MM short position was unwound. \n\n**4. Synthetic shares and Regulation SHO**\n\nWhen you short a stock you borrow a share, sell it with the intent of buying in back at a later date for a cheaper price. When the Borrowed stock is sold, there is now a synthetic share that has been created and you think of this as a legal IOU.   \n\nNaked shorting is illegal with an exception for the MM\u2019s, which as noted above, is completed to remain a delta neutral position on the security. For all other players that are shorting, they need to locate and borrow the share before they can short it. When there is a purchase or sale and the underlying share certificate is not delivered it is reported as a failure to deliver. Regulations are in place on short sales and a quick summary is available on [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) \n\nThreshold Securities are equities that have aggregate fail for 5 days, and they pop up on this fun list ([https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)). GME has been on the Threshold security list since 08Dec2020 or 29 trading days. \n\nThe relevant provisions for GME right now are the below: \n\nRule 201 \u2013 Short Sale Price Test Circuit Breaker (or the alternative uptick rule). This was triggered on Friday due to the 10% price decline and will remain in place for Tuesday. At a high level, if the market crashes or continues to fall, this rule is in place to protect the long positions and allow them to exit before new short positions can be created. \n\nRule 204 \u2013 Close-out Requirement. If a security is on the Threshold securities list for 13 consecutive settlement days, shares must be immediately purchased to close out failures to deliver. This rule is supposed to be in place to protect against naked short selling and market manipulation, however it isn\u2019t really enforced and OSTK (Overstock.com) is a prime example as they made it all the way to 669-days ([https://investors.overstock.com/news-releases/news-release-details/overstock-reappears-regulation-sho-threshold-list](https://investors.overstock.com/news-releases/news-release-details/overstock-reappears-regulation-sho-threshold-list))   \n\nWhat is enforced is unfortunately enforced is protection for the short sellers, the institutions and hedge funds that are the 1%, and when Overstock tried to push out a dividend which would spur a short squeeze, they didn\u2019t like this (lawsuit was dismissed and reopened Jan2021). [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/overstock-founder-tried-to-squeeze-short-sellers-then-sold-out-when-the-sec-cracked-down-2019-09-19](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/overstock-founder-tried-to-squeeze-short-sellers-then-sold-out-when-the-sec-cracked-down-2019-09-19) \n\nThere have been rallies on WSB to engage the media and some people have sent in formal complaints, however there is enough information to infer that markets might not be fair as they seem. As per the pre-amble, the collective community has always been fighting an uphill battle. \n\n**6. Ryan Cohen\u2019s Twitter Profile**\n\nFor any of you following Ryan Cohen on twitter, his most recent post was today with a meme of Dumb and Dumber \u201cso you\u2019re telling me there\u2019s a chance\u201d\n\nHe is building a social media presence that previously didn\u2019t exist and everything appears to be focused on aiding what was building up to be a proxy battle for GME. At this point the dude could tweet a video of himself having sex with a pig and I would buy more GME shares (direct reference to Black Mirror S1E1 \u2013 The National Anthem)   \n\nThe historical tweets have generally referenced more share purchases or material pending discloses (board seats), however the underlying is giving fair warning to the short holders to exit positions. Some of the previously deleted tweets are not back and he likely realized that once posted there was no taking them down. \n\n**7. Short Interest Position**\n\nShort Interest is the number of shares sold short that have not been covered or closed out. Short Interest is formally published to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) twice a month and daily reports published 2 hours post market close ([http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html)) \n\n[Above chart courtesy of u\\/StarSwitch post\u2019 as I don\u2019t have an OTEX account. Link to post: https:\\/\\/www.reddit.com\\/r\\/wallstreetbets\\/comments\\/kx047v\\/gme\\_options\\_update\\_melvin\\_put\\_positions\\_and\\_volume\\/  ](https://preview.redd.it/o6i5x4u0qyb61.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=43321f8ca4cf0c90b0e399c1bbf12f830e4b537b)\n\nWhat is import on all of this is that the current short interest on the company is 79.52 million shares with only 69.75 million shares issued by GME. The 31Dec2020 short interest position was 67.98 million shares, so in 2021 the short positions have grown by 11.54 million shares and there was no actual covering last week. \n\nWhat we know is that if the price continues going up the shorts will at one point be forced to buy 80 million shares. \n\n**6. Volume Reconciliation and Price Volatility** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1l3xc375qyb61.png?width=2207&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e61fa16d0468900fb7f992198bf002bc6efe26d\n\nThe last 10 trading days (all of 2021) is depicted above. From 02Jan2021 to 12Jan2021, the average daily volume was 7.95 million shares with the respective volume from 13Jan2021 to 15Jan2021 being 114.50 million, 93.72 million, and 46.75 million shares. \n\nSo, what the fuck is going on? Face appearance looks like volume has surged, and liquidity has increased (more buyers and sellers). \n\nSo back in my pre-amble, I mentioned a fundamental disadvantage that WSB maintains on trade execution as the big players have trading algorithms on servers co-located with the exchanges. The massive increase in the short positions was used to defend a short squeeze, which by all rights should have been set off on 13Jan2021 absent this unfair advantage.  \n\nThe cost of the shorts defending their position was opening an additional 11.54 million short positions the long security holders gobbling up these securities. Why would they do this? Well, it\u2019s their last stand, the magnitude of potential losses in a short squeeze would result in many of the short holders being liquidated and if they started covering their shares throughout the week the volume would have disappeared and the stock price would have been going up dollars each tick. \n\nIn section 2, I noted that the price action on 15Jan2021 was peculiar as the news was neutral. Well, this is our friends is volatility at play, any news (or a tweet from Ryan Cohen like his Dumb or Dumber tweet today) will result in material swings in the stock price as there isn\u2019t any float remaining \u2013 the same shares being traded back and forth hundreds of times a day with additional long positions resulting in the 14Jan2021 and 15Jan2021 volume declines. \n\nFor those like Crayons, I am not a fan of technical analysis; however, the last 3 days looks awfully like a bull flag in the above chart, when you considered the price suppression on 13Jan2021.  \n\n**7. What will come**\n\nAs many are aware, many brokerages started increasing the margin rates on GME to 100% - Brokerages are afraid of their exposure and don\u2019t want to get caught. \n\nCohen lit the final fuse with his tweet today and we are going to lift off next week.\n\nThe short interest being over 100% is unprecedented and this should by all rights be the most aggressive short squeeze ever witnessed in the financial markets. \n\nI started writing this post yesterday as I was hoping to be able to reconcile a price target for exit. There are a ton of factors at play, however I truly believe now that some of the original posts about this being an infinity squeeze are correct. The $100 million shelf offering, will not be sufficient, and GME will need to announce an additional offering to provide the necessary liquidity for this to fully unwind.\n\nMy personal exit strategy: 10% of holding at $1,000, with an additional 10% to be sold every $1,000 price increment.", "author_fullname": "t2_1cws05zi", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "Legacy of WSB: GME short squeeze", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 72, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"o6i5x4u0qyb61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 56, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o6i5x4u0qyb61.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5a744aff3078c3d805501d3eb4e78f6487568d27"}, {"y": 112, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o6i5x4u0qyb61.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=1739f87842162a293c22fa1e4c98f5454d718df7"}, {"y": 166, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o6i5x4u0qyb61.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=7b1bdde31e59a581e74f83a8c09712a0f68b201b"}, {"y": 333, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o6i5x4u0qyb61.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=16f819c2fe99b0d8851807c7107acbbcb86d5148"}, {"y": 500, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o6i5x4u0qyb61.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=bd93ce0c9449419e777428aa02e174fd161e5751"}, {"y": 562, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o6i5x4u0qyb61.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f974c94f4793143340d67f0f2e7f9fd86ed73d54"}], "s": {"y": 750, "x": 1440, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o6i5x4u0qyb61.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=43321f8ca4cf0c90b0e399c1bbf12f830e4b537b"}, "id": "o6i5x4u0qyb61"}, "1l3xc375qyb61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1l3xc375qyb61.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=537b401cd350a987c67c7f86d3e865fde48b9e2a"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1l3xc375qyb61.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=af26659021f6c017ce42358513e95c1f1c03e61b"}, {"y": 179, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1l3xc375qyb61.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c9565e14a5ad9de950897aa3edfe72fca9e4b528"}, {"y": 359, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1l3xc375qyb61.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f67369033b450d00c8108f3a71568cf63ffda3f9"}, {"y": 539, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1l3xc375qyb61.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a59f38aa04faa96067a91090e763ae40fdb41a02"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1l3xc375qyb61.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a76cbddad6b21a4410843e46fb50c6708593864a"}], "s": {"y": 1241, "x": 2207, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1l3xc375qyb61.png?width=2207&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e61fa16d0468900fb7f992198bf002bc6efe26d"}, "id": "1l3xc375qyb61"}}, "name": "t3_kzftk2", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 957, "total_awards_received": 22, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 957, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/qhbgoLp5KZn7IeEKyvX7omzDRsSYCdwy9V5fW-gxGzc.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 3, "gid_2": 1, "gid_3": 2}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610948826.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This post is unfortunately very verbose and many of you can\u2019t real so apologies in advance. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is not investment advice and only serves to provides commentary on of the financial markets and a mosaic theory on what is to come with respect to GME.

This can be a prudent financial decision to satisfy a basic human need (shelter and Lambo\u2019s) and isn\u2019t always a signal that you think the real estate market and Lambo\u2019s are better long-term investments than the stock market. </p>\n\n<p>Insider trades are a potential signal only.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>2. What happened last week.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>From 08Jan2021 close to 14Jan2021 close GME increased 126% from $17.69 to $39.91 (ignoring intraday highs) with the gains partially retreating on 15Jan2021 to $35.50 resulting in a 1-week gain of 101%.    </p>\n\n<p>As per media, the pre-market 11Jan2021 SEC filing with Cohen assuming 3-board seats (Cohen and his 2 Chewy pals Alan Attal and Jim Grube) spurred and increase in retail demand and set off a short squeeze with the Friday declines due to the sale of 810,000 indirectly controlled shares by director James Wolf. </p>\n\n<p>Media is partially correct in that the Ryan Cohen filing resulting in a material increase in retail investment and drove up the share price, however it wasn\u2019t a short squeeze. The combination of the increased demand and the precariously low float set off a gamma squeeze, which further exacerbating the upwards price movement. </p>\n\n<p>The James Wolf divestiture for any other company should have been relatively neutral news and should not have resulted in the Friday declines \u2013 these shares were indirectly owned shares by Hestia Capital Partners, LP with the sale to adhere to the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of Hestia Capital. James Wolf and his wife personally own 50,689 shares (unchanged). James Wolf is on the board due to a proxy battle that goes back to 2019 and it is well covered on pages 13-15 of the 2020 Proxy Statement and is worth a quick read (<a href=\"https://news.gamestop.com/node/17701/html#toc878410_6\">https://news.gamestop.com/node/17701/html#toc878410_6</a>). </p>\n\n<p>As a result, the Friday market reaction is very peculiar. If you manage a portfolio\u2019s for others and the maximum single stock exposure that can be held is 10% for example with that stock increasing in value more than other positions, you need to reduce the exposure and rebalance to be within the investor policy statement thresholds otherwise it\u2019s a breach of fiduciary duty. Majority of the disposal was on 12Jan2021 at share price of $19.99 with the remaining 11% (90,000 shares) sold on 13Jan2021 were at $31.08. The requirement to rebalance came before the price spike this week and James\u2019s clients missed out on 50% one day gains.</p>\n\n<p>Additional insider sales were noted on 15Jan2020 post market by the outgoing directors (not nominated for the 2021 Director Slate) as follows: Lizabeth Dunn (5,000 shares or 8.03% of holdings at $31.34), Raul Fernandez (34,619 shares or 51.36% of holdings at $35.27 average), Kathy Vrabeck (50,000 shares or 38.60% of holdings at $27.99). This represents an additional 89,619 in shares sold by outgoing directors and would be relatively normal given. This should cause an additional market decline on Tuesday absent any other information, however as above these trades should be relatively neutral signals and likely would have occurred with or without a price run up during the week.  </p>\n\n<p>What is currently missing is additional filings for additional share acquisitions of Ryan Cohen, Alan Attal, and Jim Grube that will be forthcoming in the coming weeks and would displace the ~900,000 shares divested above. </p>\n\n<p><strong>3. What is a Gamma Squeeze</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is going to be an oversimplification, as to understand a Gamma squeeze you need to understand the math behind option\u2019s and the role of Market Makers (\u201cMM\u201d). I am going to keep things simple and only focus on the key points as this has already played out.   </p>\n\n<p><strong>Delta</strong>: measures the impact of change of the underlying asset. Hopefully you retards understand what a share is and if the share price goes up $1 the price of the share will also go up $1 and shares have a delta of 1. The delta on options will constantly change as the price changes (this is measured by Gamma below), however what is important is that far out of the money options have a delta closer to 0 and deep in the money options have a delta closer to 1 (or -1 if they are puts). Hypothetical example: a call option that as a current delta of 0.7 will go up $0.70 in price for a $1 increase in the share price, as the share price increased the delta will also increase to say 0.71 and then 0.72 and so on. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: measures the rate of change of Delta. This measures how much the delta will increase with every increase in the share price and will be the highest when the options are at the money. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Market Makers</strong>: the MM\u2019s trade for their own account and make money based on bid-ask spreads (stock and options) and will look to be delta neutral. MM\u2019s create most of the liquidity in the stock market.  </p>\n\n<p>With that out of the way, what happened with the gamma squeeze?  Well, this is thanks to our friends at Melvin Capital Management LP (\u201cMelvin\u201d) who is well know and documented to death on this boards. As a special thanks to Melvin we should chip in with $100 when they set up their Go Fund Me account next week as none of this would be possible without their assistance. Cole\u2019s notes are below.  </p>\n\n<p>Melvin\u2019s most recent filing dated 16Nov2020 disclosed a position of 54,000 put options and has been documented that the open interest was on 15Jan2021 24p.  (<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml\">https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml</a>)  </p>\n\n<p>The Put options would have allowed Melvin to sell 5,400,000 shares (7.83% of total GME shares) at $24 to a </p>\n\n<p>MM. The MM would have hedged the delta on this position by selling shares short. As the puts went from ITM to ATM to OTM, the market make would have continued to manage a delta neutral position through buying the stock (covering shorts), buying back puts, or buying calls all which would have created positive price pressure.  </p>\n\n<p>Cohen\u2019s board appointments set everything in motion, share price started spiking, and to remain delta-neutral the MM\u2019s exacerbated the upside price movements as above (due to the changes in delta). Positive price movements and FOMO on a short squeeze continued to drive up the price (especially with WSB buying deep OTM options and volatility spiking). This defines the price movements on 13Jan2021 the previous downward pressure of the MM short position was unwound. </p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Synthetic shares and Regulation SHO</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you short a stock you borrow a share, sell it with the intent of buying in back at a later date for a cheaper price. When the Borrowed stock is sold, there is now a synthetic share that has been created and you think of this as a legal IOU.   </p>\n\n<p>Naked shorting is illegal with an exception for the MM\u2019s, which as noted above, is completed to remain a delta neutral position on the security. For all other players that are shorting, they need to locate and borrow the share before they can short it. When there is a purchase or sale and the underlying share certificate is not delivered it is reported as a failure to deliver. Regulations are in place on short sales and a quick summary is available on <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm</a> </p>\n\n<p>Threshold Securities are equities that have aggregate fail for 5 days, and they pop up on this fun list (<a href=\"https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities\">https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities</a>). GME has been on the Threshold security list since 08Dec2020 or 29 trading days. </p>\n\n<p>The relevant provisions for GME right now are the below: </p>\n\n<p>Rule 201 \u2013 Short Sale Price Test Circuit Breaker (or the alternative uptick rule). This was triggered on Friday due to the 10% price decline and will remain in place for Tuesday. At a high level, if the market crashes or continues to fall, this rule is in place to protect the long positions and allow them to exit before new short positions can be created. </p>\n\n<p>Rule 204 \u2013 Close-out Requirement. If a security is on the Threshold securities list for 13 consecutive settlement days, shares must be immediately purchased to close out failures to deliver. This rule is supposed to be in place to protect against naked short selling and market manipulation, however it isn\u2019t really enforced and OSTK (Overstock.com) is a prime example as they made it all the way to 669-days (<a href=\"https://investors.overstock.com/news-releases/news-release-details/overstock-reappears-regulation-sho-threshold-list\">https://investors.overstock.com/news-releases/news-release-details/overstock-reappears-regulation-sho-threshold-list</a>)   </p>\n\n<p>What is enforced is unfortunately enforced is protection for the short sellers, the institutions and hedge funds that are the 1%, and when Overstock tried to push out a dividend which would spur a short squeeze, they didn\u2019t like this (lawsuit was dismissed and reopened Jan2021). <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/overstock-founder-tried-to-squeeze-short-sellers-then-sold-out-when-the-sec-cracked-down-2019-09-19\">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/overstock-founder-tried-to-squeeze-short-sellers-then-sold-out-when-the-sec-cracked-down-2019-09-19</a> </p>\n\n<p>There have been rallies on WSB to engage the media and some people have sent in formal complaints, however there is enough information to infer that markets might not be fair as they seem. As per the pre-amble, the collective community has always been fighting an uphill battle. </p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Ryan Cohen\u2019s Twitter Profile</strong></p>\n\n<p>For any of you following Ryan Cohen on twitter, his most recent post was today with a meme of Dumb and Dumber \u201cso you\u2019re telling me there\u2019s a chance\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He is building a social media presence that previously didn\u2019t exist and everything appears to be focused on aiding what was building up to be a proxy battle for GME. At this point the dude could tweet a video of himself having sex with a pig and I would buy more GME shares (direct reference to Black Mirror S1E1 \u2013 The National Anthem)   </p>\n\n<p>The historical tweets have generally referenced more share purchases or material pending discloses (board seats), however the underlying is giving fair warning to the short holders to exit positions. Some of the previously deleted tweets are not back and he likely realized that once posted there was no taking them down. </p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Short Interest Position</strong></p>\n\n<p>Short Interest is the number of shares sold short that have not been covered or closed out. Short Interest is formally published to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) twice a month and daily reports published 2 hours post market close (<a href=\"http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html\">http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html</a>) </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/o6i5x4u0qyb61.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43321f8ca4cf0c90b0e399c1bbf12f830e4b537b\">Above chart courtesy of u/StarSwitch post\u2019 as I don\u2019t have an OTEX account. Link to post: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kx047v/gme_options_update_melvin_put_positions_and_volume/  </a></p>\n\n<p>What is import on all of this is that the current short interest on the company is 79.52 million shares with only 69.75 million shares issued by GME. The 31Dec2020 short interest position was 67.98 million shares, so in 2021 the short positions have grown by 11.54 million shares and there was no actual covering last week. </p>\n\n<p>What we know is that if the price continues going up the shorts will at one point be forced to buy 80 million shares. </p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Volume Reconciliation and Price Volatility</strong> </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1l3xc375qyb61.png?width=2207&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e61fa16d0468900fb7f992198bf002bc6efe26d\">https://preview.redd.it/1l3xc375qyb61.png?width=2207&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e61fa16d0468900fb7f992198bf002bc6efe26d</a></p>\n\n<p>The last 10 trading days (all of 2021) is depicted above. From 02Jan2021 to 12Jan2021, the average daily volume was 7.95 million shares with the respective volume from 13Jan2021 to 15Jan2021 being 114.50 million, 93.72 million, and 46.75 million shares. </p>\n\n<p>So, what the fuck is going on? Face appearance looks like volume has surged, and liquidity has increased (more buyers and sellers). </p>\n\n<p>So back in my pre-amble, I mentioned a fundamental disadvantage that WSB maintains on trade execution as the big players have trading algorithms on servers co-located with the exchanges. The massive increase in the short positions was used to defend a short squeeze, which by all rights should have been set off on 13Jan2021 absent this unfair advantage.  </p>\n\n<p>The cost of the shorts defending their position was opening an additional 11.54 million short positions the long security holders gobbling up these securities. Why would they do this? Well, it\u2019s their last stand, the magnitude of potential losses in a short squeeze would result in many of the short holders being liquidated and if they started covering their shares throughout the week the volume would have disappeared and the stock price would have been going up dollars each tick. </p>\n\n<p>In section 2, I noted that the price action on 15Jan2021 was peculiar as the news was neutral. Well, this is our friends is volatility at play, any news (or a tweet from Ryan Cohen like his Dumb or Dumber tweet today) will result in material swings in the stock price as there isn\u2019t any float remaining \u2013 the same shares being traded back and forth hundreds of times a day with additional long positions resulting in the 14Jan2021 and 15Jan2021 volume declines. </p>\n\n<p>For those like Crayons, I am not a fan of technical analysis; however, the last 3 days looks awfully like a bull flag in the above chart, when you considered the price suppression on 13Jan2021.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>7. What will come</strong></p>\n\n<p>As many are aware, many brokerages started increasing the margin rates on GME to 100% - Brokerages are afraid of their exposure and don\u2019t want to get caught. </p>\n\n<p>Cohen lit the final fuse with his tweet today and we are going to lift off next week.</p>\n\n<p>The short interest being over 100% is unprecedented and this should by all rights be the most aggressive short squeeze ever witnessed in the financial markets. </p>\n\n<p>I started writing this post yesterday as I was hoping to be able to reconcile a price target for exit. There are a ton of factors at play, however I truly believe now that some of the original posts about this being an infinity squeeze are correct. The $100 million shelf offering, will not be sufficient, and GME will need to announce an additional offering to provide the necessary liquidity for this to fully unwind.</p>\n\n<p>My personal exit strategy: 10% of holding at $1,000, with an additional 10% to be sold every $1,000 price increment.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null,
