{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "(Not sure if this is the right flair)\n\nHello everyone! I don\u2019t know about you, but I love to make plays on company earnings. There\u2019s nothing more exciting than eagerly waiting for that earnings call to come after you\u2019ve locked in your position. I wanted a more quantitative approach to these plays. I made a machine learning model to assist in predicting whether or not a company would beat earnings. I present to you a personal project of mine: EarningsBot.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nEarningsBot is trained to predict whether a company will beat consensus earnings estimates for the upcoming earnings report. The training data consists of features extracted from the previous 10Q statements like debt, cash, funds from operations, etc. The model is attempting to answer questions like \u201cWill a company\u2019s debt in Q3 impact if said company will beat earnings in Q4\u201d? The model also considers if a particular company is always missing/beating earnings.\n\n**How accurate is the model?**\n\nThe model has an accuracy of 65.8% on the test data set (data the model has not seen before).\n\n**What algorithm are you using?**\n\nI\u2019m using a decision tree model (XGBoost).\n\n**What are some important features the model is learning?**\n\nSome features the model learned to pay close attention to:\n\n* Funds from operations\n* Global Industry Classification\n* Account payable/Creditors\n\n**How many data samples are you using?**\n\nI have data from 2008-2020 with a little more than 90,000 earnings reports from 8,725 companies. I\u2019m using 2,541 features.\n\n**Don\u2019t companies already have a natural tendency to beat earnings?**\n\nYes, companies will beat earnings at a rate of 57%. However, we are still above chance!\n\n**What\u2019s the point??? A stock can still go down even if they beat earnings!**\n\nYes this is definitely possible, especially if there is negative news in the earnings report. However, I calculated the percent change in stock price before and after earnings for companies that beat and companies that missed earnings from 2008-2020. The average percent change in price after earnings announcements for companies that beat earnings is 1.6%. The average percent change in price for companies that miss earnings is -1.8%. So take that to the bank!\n\n**This is pretty vague, you got any source code?**\n\nI plan to have a proper write up on arXiv when I\u2019m a bit less busy, and potentially some source code.\n\n**Shut up nerd just give me the ticker and tell me how I can make money off of this**\n\nThis is for research purposes only so don\u2019t use it as financial advice \ud83d\ude09. I take the companies that the model predicts as \u201cwill beat earnings\u201d and split up $1000-$2000 as shares among them a couple days before earnings. Then after earnings, I dump everything and repeat. On average, my percent gain per trade is 1.73%.\n\nThanks for reading \ud83d\ude0a please ask any other questions below and I\u2019ll try to get to them!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are some upcoming predictions for the next two weeks. Values closer to 1 means the model predicts the company \"will beat earnings\". Values closer to 0 means the model predicts the company \"will miss earnings\".\n\n**WARNING: THE MODEL IS TRAINED TO STRONGLY AVOID FALSE POSITIVES. THIS MEANS THAT IT IS HEAVILY PENALIZED FOR LABELING A COMPANY AS \"WILL BEAT EARNINGS\", WHEN IT IN FACT MISSES EARNINGS. BE CAREFUL IF TRYING TO SHORT A STOCK THAT IS LABELED AS \"WILL MISS EARNINGS\".**\n\nWeek of 1/18/2021:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qx95biw7l5c61.png?width=367&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec7e3faffd9ec6ca8c75dd35ae247abdcda5d846\n\nWeek of 1/25/2021:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k3o8ngubn5c61.png?width=358&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e388467c0c4d9d5cab745b9a88f33c0cc0b8887", "author_fullname": "t2_69gax5mi", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "EarningsBot \u2013 Automated earnings estimates for upcoming company earnings", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Discussion"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "media_metadata": {"k3o8ngubn5c61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 216, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k3o8ngubn5c61.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=646b7041207259df1f7a3a132236c4957d08fdc4"}, {"y": 432, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k3o8ngubn5c61.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=8ec5fe5edcd830af367a1f79f0c91bfae9fb65fe"}, {"y": 640, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k3o8ngubn5c61.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=29a8b5e63c84765881b8beaa4fe43d332098e8ab"}], "s": {"y": 6061, "x": 358, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k3o8ngubn5c61.png?width=358&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e388467c0c4d9d5cab745b9a88f33c0cc0b8887"}, "id": "k3o8ngubn5c61"}, "qx95biw7l5c61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 216, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qx95biw7l5c61.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a4cc5d8cb1ab44c41198a11106247f1738e8185c"}, {"y": 432, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qx95biw7l5c61.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=49167603183cc38d228be26f14d4af2cf3dd6a58"}, {"y": 640, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qx95biw7l5c61.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=817166c2d1d9ba2bffff4cac7a5e2b315dc062fd"}], "s": {"y": 1641, "x": 367, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qx95biw7l5c61.png?width=367&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec7e3faffd9ec6ca8c75dd35ae247abdcda5d846"}, "id": "qx95biw7l5c61"}}, "name": "t3_l03kzo", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/r2abF2qVB2gaC445WfMPDyMsGgSJA1hq4672ZOVMhJY.jpg", "edited": 1611003614.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1611032110.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>(Not sure if this is the right flair)</p>\n\n<p>Hello everyone!
