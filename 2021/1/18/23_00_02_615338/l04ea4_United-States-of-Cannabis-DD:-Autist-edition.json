By today's standards, the efficiency is almost unbelievable. It's mostly due to the extenuating circumstances of his term: Roosevelt was dealing with the Great Depression when he was inaugurated, and the **nationwide sense of emergency allowed him to take action swiftly**. And while the circumstances for following presidents were less dire, the term stuck.\n\n[https://www.popsugar.com/news/why-are-first-100-days-important-for-president-48070657](https://www.popsugar.com/news/why-are-first-100-days-important-for-president-48070657)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Okay Let's talk money\n\n>US retail marijuana sales on pace to rise 40% in 2020, near $37 billion by 2024\n\n[https://mjbizdaily.com/exclusive-us-retail-marijuana-sales-on-pace-to-rise-40-in-2020-near-37-billion-by-2023/](https://mjbizdaily.com/exclusive-us-retail-marijuana-sales-on-pace-to-rise-40-in-2020-near-37-billion-by-2023/)\n\nAdult-Use of cannabis is on track to go up 5Billion a year for the next few years. That's retard growth. In 2020 is was only around $11.8Billion. **Estimates say next year it could be as high as $15.9Billion. That's 74% in one year. That's fucking insane.** This year and this year alone is special because its' the fastest percentage growth. Further years will have the same nominal growth but the already existing base of Adult users will offset the growth %\n\nCovid acted in two ways. It killed many people that opposed this legislation which makes it politically safer for republican senators to approve it  and it offset the ability of congress to even really address it. It created a stall moment. Right now is the best time to go deep because it's not being talked about on the news.\n\nYou can play this any way you want. I personally will be going balls deep and holding for years to come but the key to winning this is to make all your moves BEFORE congress talks about it. The second they mention it the game is over and someone else took your sticky sweet cali kush purple haze tendies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Why should we focus on American cannabis rather than others?\n\nBecause congress will engineer the law to favor American cannabis industry inside. That's going to help them with inequality and racial injustice in the United States. It's both a strong economic and political move. American industry boom can also fuel job growth which once again is something that's on Biden's economic plan and we are in dire need of job growth from the fallout of the pandemic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\n* It may be as little as 3-6 months before we see cannabis get passed.\n* the most powerful people in our government (Senate Leader / Vice President) want it to happen\n* The president needs to unite people and cannabis is EXTREMELY popular among citizens\n* Expense ratios on all the ETFs I post are basically exactly the same\n* We just had one hell of a weekend so everything is on discount right now\n* Go buy weed and finally have sex with your wife instead of her boyfriend all the time\n\n# ETFs and Tickers\n\n# Enter MSOS - American cannabis \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n[MSOS  - AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF](https://www.etf.com/MSOS#overview)\n\nMSOS is the first US-listed actively managed ETF to provide exposure solely to American cannabis and hemp companies, including multi-state operators (MSOs).

This is the exact thing Biden needs to do to become a fucking super hero in the eyes of the public and that&#39;s what he wants and needs right now.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/us/politics/house-marijuana.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/us/politics/house-marijuana.html</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h2>What Is the Significance of the First 100 Days?</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The idea comes from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd US president, who passed <a href=\"http://www.history.com/news/fast-facts-on-the-first-100-days\">15 major pieces of legislation and 76 laws</a> during the first 100 days of his presidency in 1933. By today&#39;s standards, the efficiency is almost unbelievable. It&#39;s mostly due to the extenuating circumstances of his term: Roosevelt was dealing with the Great Depression when he was inaugurated, and the <strong>nationwide sense of emergency allowed him to take action swiftly</strong>. And while the circumstances for following presidents were less dire, the term stuck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/news/why-are-first-100-days-important-for-president-48070657\">https://www.popsugar.com/news/why-are-first-100-days-important-for-president-48070657</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Okay Let&#39;s talk money</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>US retail marijuana sales on pace to rise 40% in 2020, near $37 billion by 2024</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mjbizdaily.com/exclusive-us-retail-marijuana-sales-on-pace-to-rise-40-in-2020-near-37-billion-by-2023/\">https://mjbizdaily.com/exclusive-us-retail-marijuana-sales-on-pace-to-rise-40-in-2020-near-37-billion-by-2023/</a></p>\n\n<p>Adult-Use of cannabis is on track to go up 5Billion a year for the next few years. That&#39;s retard growth. In 2020 is was only around $11.8Billion. <strong>Estimates say next year it could be as high as $15.9Billion. That&#39;s 74% in one year. That&#39;s fucking insane.</strong> This year and this year alone is special because its&#39; the fastest percentage growth. Further years will have the same nominal growth but the already existing base of Adult users will offset the growth %</p>\n\n<p>Covid acted in two ways. It killed many people that opposed this legislation which makes it politically safer for republican senators to approve it  and it offset the ability of congress to even really address it. It created a stall moment. Right now is the best time to go deep because it&#39;s not being talked about on the news.</p>\n\n<p>You can play this any way you want. I personally will be going balls deep and holding for years to come but the key to winning this is to make all your moves BEFORE congress talks about it. The second they mention it the game is over and someone else took your sticky sweet cali kush purple haze tendies.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Why should we focus on American cannabis rather than others?</h1>\n\n<p>Because congress will engineer the law to favor American cannabis industry inside. That&#39;s going to help them with inequality and racial injustice in the United States. It&#39;s both a strong economic and political move. American industry boom can also fuel job growth which once again is something that&#39;s on Biden&#39;s economic plan and we are in dire need of job growth from the fallout of the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It may be as little as 3-6 months before we see cannabis get passed.</li>\n<li>the most powerful people in our government (Senate Leader / Vice President) want it to happen</li>\n<li>The president needs to unite people and cannabis is EXTREMELY popular among citizens</li>\n<li>Expense ratios on all the ETFs I post are basically exactly the same</li>\n<li>We just had one hell of a weekend so everything is on discount right now</li>\n<li>Go buy weed and finally have sex with your wife instead of her boyfriend all the time</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>ETFs and Tickers</h1>\n\n<h1>Enter MSOS - American cannabis \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.etf.com/MSOS#overview\">MSOS  - AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF</a></p>\n\n<p>MSOS is the first US-listed actively managed ETF to provide exposure solely to American cannabis and hemp companies, including multi-state operators (MSOs). This is the second fund from AdvisorShares dedicated to the cannabis investment strategy.

They are ready and have \ud83d\udca6very high liquidity\ud83d\udca6 for the second that cannabis becomes recreationally legal. The agility of having 50% sitting in basically liquid makes it imo a top pick. Any first-to-market advantage that Canada or other countries have will quickly outstripped by proximity advantage of a local US brand. <a href=\"https://www.dailyrecord.com/story/news/2020/11/06/legal-weed-nj-marijuana-farm-gets-ready-first-harvest/6167161002/\">US companies are waiting for the legalization will quickly hit economy of scales that other competing countries can&#39;t with respect to domestic consumption</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Popular Holdings: 100% American</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Curaleaf CURLF 13% American</li>\n<li>Green Thumb  GTBIF 12.6% American</li>\n<li>Trueieve  TCNNF  12.7% American</li>\n<li>Cresco  CRLBF  10.6% American</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Average volume: 1.14M</p>\n\n<p>52 Low 20.45</p>\n\n<p>52 High 47.55</p>\n\n<p>Market cap ~500M</p>\n\n<p>P/E -18.00</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m extremely confident in MSOS because it&#39;s not flashy like the others, has solid market cap and has grown the least in price of more enticingly named ETFs.
