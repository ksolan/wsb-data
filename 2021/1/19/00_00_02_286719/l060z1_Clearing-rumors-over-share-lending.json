For any shares held in a cash account your brokerage must get your permission to loan them out.  If you have a margin account, they can be lent out at any time without notice as long as you hold a **negative balance** I.E. you have used margin to buy.  This means if you have a margin account, but your shares were all purchased using only cash, they still need your permission.\n\nEdit: remember when you buy on margin you don't actually own those shares, the brokerage does.   This is why they don't need your permission to loan them out.  While it will likely never happen, the brokerage can contact you at any time ask for their money back\n\n2. Does putting a sell order on shares prevent them from being loaned out? Yes , if you put in a sale order for $$$, they will be tied up and unavailable to be lent out. This doesn't really matter though because if your shares are already loaned they just find other shares to fulfill the sale if it actually goes through.  My guess here is if you have shares purchased with cash and a sale order in place your brokerage won't bother asking you if you want to loan them out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. If I set my shares to sell at $420.69 will my broker lower that? **Absolutely not!**  If you put in a sale for 420.69, then they will sell for that minimum price.  If you told a brokerage you wanted to sell for 420.69 and they sold it for less they would be open to lawsuits and penalties.\n\nThis has been confused with buy orders.
