{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I imagine my dumbass retarded autistic self as a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b of fictitious XYZ stock and ask myself: Just how valuable is a share of XYZ? This is a guide to help you understand how \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs can end up with their back against the wall.\n\nMods:\n\n* This is not advice about any particular stock.\n* This is all hypothetical and simply a thought experiment.\n* This is to foster discussion about strategies short sellers might take in certain market conditions.\n\n---\n\n**Introduction**\n\nHi. I'm a flaming \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b. I saw a company that was dying, applied boomer logic, and decided to borrow a ton of shares, dump them into the market, and drive down their share price. I got a big wad of cash from selling, but I owe my broker shares. No problem, I thought, I'll buy back those shares when the company goes bankrupt and I'll get to keep the cash.\n\nI got all my buddies involved in spreading boomer logic about the company having no future, and this seemed like a pretty safe bet. XYZ seemed to be going the way of blockbuster and was clearly doomed for bankruptcy.  Well... things changed.\n\n*It might still be a safe bet that they go bankrupt, but unfortunately that doesn't matter anymore...*\n\n**My Situation**\n\nSo, I borrowed these shares, and sold them on the market. I have a wad of cash, which is cool, but now the shares have gone up in value (something about positive outlook and some activist investor with retarded tweets). At some point I need to buy the shares back to give to my broker. (This is called covering, you dumbass).\n\nMy broker is not a saint, and they aren't lending shit to me for free.\n\nMy broker says shares in XYZ are worth $X each, and I borrowed Y shares, so they're charging me interest on $X * Y... every single day. The interest rate they are charging me is also getting ridiculously high, because my broker has trouble finding shares for me to borrow.\n\nThose profiteering bastards are charging me high interest because they know shares of XYZ are hard to come by, and they are taking advantage of me. Fuckers. I want to switch to another broker, but they're doing the exact same thing!\n\nFuck, this fucking sucks.\n\n**Digging my own grave**\n\nOk, don't panic. I have a plan.\n\nI have a lot of money, and the stock has gone up a bunch already. I'll borrow more shares, dump them on the market, and when people see the price go down, they'll think to themselves: \"Well shit, I just gained 100% in the last month, but now the stock is going down... I guess I should just sell\".\n\nHopefully everyone will apply that same logic, the price will go down, and I can start buying back the shares to cover. I'll give it a shot...\n\n(shorts more shares)\n\n...Ok, that worked, a little bit. The stock price went down, but it didn't tank as much as expected. Are these guys going to sell or what?\n\nI don't know how much longer I can stomach this fucking interest. Also, what are the other \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b's going to do? Do I need to worry? Oh... shit...\n\n**My Situation, Part 2**\n\nOk, so it turns out that I'm not the only \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b. In fact, combined, \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b's owe their brokers more shares than exist. This fucking sucks, because if I want to buy shares to cover, they probably do, too.\n\nWhat are they going to do? Are they going to cover? Because, if they do, they're going cause the price to go up, and then when I want to buy shares, I'll have to pay even more! Fuck!\n\nShould I cover now?\n\nWait a second, what's this on the news? People are catching wind that there are so many \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs in XYZ, and that we are suffering. FUUCCCK.... what if people with shares use this to their advantage? What if they see how desperately I need to buy shares off of them and simply refuse to sell until, like, $200 or some ridiculous price?\n\nLet me Google this... OH FUCK. It's called a short squeeze. Apparently this happened in similar conditions to VW and KBIO and... what the fuck... their share prices went up like 10x and 100x in a couple of days? How the fuck? Makes no sense, couldn't possibly happen to me.\n\nOk, think. How about I just cover my position? I can go out on the market and buy back all the shares I owe. No big deal.\n\nLet me check the order book. Uh... this fucking blows. I can buy back like 10% of the shares I owe, but then the price of the stock will have gone up like 30%. Every time I try to cover, the stock price will just keep going up! There are even a ton of people who won't sell to me unless I pay them $420.69. What the fuck?!\n\nWhere are all the people with the shares? Come on, they've seen so much gains recently, just flip them for a profit!\n\nLet me check. Um... I'm seeing a lot of institutional investors. Well, these guys don't really sell that often, and they're probably smart enough to see I'm in a shitty situation. There's this Ryan Cohen dude who owns a bunch of shares, but he just tweets random bullshit and doesn't seem like he will sell me any. There's this message board full of people just as retarded as me... but if I know how desperate I am, they probably know that too.\n\nAlright, calm the fuck down. I can think of a way out of this.\n\n**What Can I Do?**\n\nOk. I'm calm. Let me take inventory of what I'm dealing with here.\n\nPros:\n\n* I have a ton of cash.\n\nCons:\n\n* XYZ has gone up in price\n* Maybe XYZ's fundamentals have improved?\n* I have borrowed far too many shares\n* I keep having to pay interest on these borrowed shares\n* Everyone is aware that my back is against the wall\n* If a short squeeze happens, I'm fucked\n* Shareholders don't appear to be easily spooked\n* I'm retarded\n\nOk. Clearly, I lost. **The plan now is to minimize my losses.**\n\nI need to buy back shares for as cheaply as possible, without causing a huge fucking squeeze.\n\nHow about I go to some big shareholders and cut them a deal? I'll buy a ton of shares from them for, say, 3x the current market value. This is probably better than just going onto the open market. The question is, will they bail me out, and at what price? Let me take a look at institutional investors. Oh, fuck, it's pretty spread out. The best I can do is make deals with a handful and cover maybe 30% of my shares? Not really sure, actually, as I'm a fucking autist and too lazy to do all the digging.\n\nAlright, well how about I try to spook retail investors, like those WSB retards? What if I cover a ton of shares at once, bump the price up another 50%, and hope they all think this is the squeeze? I'll just sit there and buy back shares as they panic sell. If it works, I can try it again later. If it doesn't, well, at least I covered some shares.\n\nI think I'll try that this week.\n\nAnother option is I can buy a ton of ITM calls and exercise them immediately. I'll lose a ton of money because I'm basically burning up the premium I paid for them... but I'll get those sweet shares of XYZ.  It's not my problem to buy the shares of XYZ from the market, it's the retard who sold me the calls!\n\n---\n\nOk, that's as far as I can stomach.
