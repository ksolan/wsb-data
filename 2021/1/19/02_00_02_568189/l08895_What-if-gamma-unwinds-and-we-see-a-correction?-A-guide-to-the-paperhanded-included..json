{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "So you know how the market has been edging up without a large retrace ever since the November lows? A lot of this has been linked to vaccine hopes and huge amount of cash looking for tendies. Crucially, it's also linked to huge volumes of call options being bought. If a dealer/market maker (MM) sells you calls, he wants to keep the tendies without taking any risk. So to hedge the risk of selling the calls and seeing the underlying rise, he needs to hedge his risk by buying the underlying (either stocks or index futures). The # of shares he needs to buy depends on the gamma - gamma is higher when the stock price moves closer to the strike price.\n\nIf call volume increase, dealer buying of the underlying stocks also increases, further lifting the stocks.

A bear move doesn't need a lot of sellers, it just needs a lack of buying at current levels, a small correction.

A short squeeze doesn't need permission from the index or Melvin. Individual stocks don't need to follow the index 1 to 1 if there are other supporting factors.
