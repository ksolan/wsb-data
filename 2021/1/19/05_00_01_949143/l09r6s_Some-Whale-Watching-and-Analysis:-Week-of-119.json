Inbox open all night like the trap house. *\n________________\n\nSome Unusual Options Activity caught my eye from Friday for this week.  I typically like to scan the prior Friday on the weekend, so I figured I\u2019d share what I was looking at in case it gives you confirmation bias or an idea. \n\n*REMEMBER: UOA IS AN EDUCATED GUESSING GAME WHERE YOU ARE TRYING TO STAY ABOVE 50%, AND HAVE A FEW AMAZING BAGGERS HERE AND THERE. DO NOT YOLO WHALES*\n\n**The way I\u2019ll break this down is by laying out my..**\n\n**C choices:** Options activity that is intriguing, but seems like there is a strong possibility it could be a hedge, a sell the news event, isn't confirmed once I do more research, or hasn't been called out by Unusual Whales.  No precise formula. \n\n**B choices:** Ones I am pretty down to hop on, but need to see more.  I might be waiting for a dip, a related news event to play out, or this is one I feel could go against me big if it's an institutional hedge because of its Greeks. \n\n**A choices:** Shit I will likely buy right at the open, fits into what my thought process on a sector generally has been, and is simply a ticker I like.  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**C choices some whales bought:**\n\n**FSLR and SPWR: Somebody is betting solar**\n\n[UOA cluster example for both](https://i.imgur.com/5BzcmaV.jpg)\n**FSLR**: underlying=96.85 **Order**: 110c 1/22 (IV 63.98%)\n\n**SPWR**: underlying= 31.96 **Orders**: 33 and 37c 1/22\n\n**Unusual Whales Alert:** FSLR no/SPWR YES \n\n**Earnings Reports**: Mid February\n\n**Why I like it:** Solar cooled down a little bit after the Biden-stonk frenzy to start off the week.  ICLN, EV, etc could just be refueling, and aren't necessarily done running.\n\n**Why I don\u2019t like it:** Falling knives, and could still be finding the bottom of it's channel.  It had a hell of a run, and hopping in now feels greedy.  The volume on these orders is also low, which can be a coinflip as to what it means.  Sometimes 600-1,000 volume is the sweet spot, but\n\n**IV and Greeks [SPWR greeks]:** shitty theta (you\u2019re giving back almost 20% of premium price each day on the 1/29c) and IV at or near the money is already about 100% by this point.  The only upside to straight buying a call is playing the IV/Vega on Joe Biden's inauguration speech\n\n**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** Biden's inauguration speech could lay out a great renewable energy plan that gives the whole sector a boost.  Last week people played weed, energy and EV in hopes that his Thursday speech would touch on these things--there is a much higher likelihood his inauration speech will.  Also, [huge news about the Keystone pipeline came out this weekend ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55709261), and I don't know if this means uppies or downies for other oil companies, since big oil is trying to appeal by saying they'll switch sources. \n\n**Position**: Waiting to see how Keystone decision fallout hits them tomorrow morning.  If there is a significant dip I'll probably buy it for some 1/29 SPWR calls Wednesday morning and dump with a swiftness after inauguration.\n\n**B choices**:\n\n[**PEP\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** underlying=141.39 **Orders**: 152.50 2/12c (IV 20.74%), 143c 1/22 (IV 16%)](https://i.imgur.com/67bZ71V.jpg)\n\n**Unusual Whales**: No alert\n\n**Earnings Report**: February 11th\n\n**Why I kinda like it:** Didn't see many KO calls around, but saw the PEP calls; that contrast made the order stand out to me as more than a sector/industry bet.  The fact that the ER is one day before the 2/12 call expiration makes me like this play because I can pick up some IV along the way for what feels like a very oversold tech stalwart.  \n\n**[IV and the Greeks:** Looks good to me, no major caution flags.  BUT, the bid/ask spread is a little wide.  This partially keeps it at C level; I\u2019ll probably put in a low bid, forget it, and see if the price action during the day gets the order filled.\n\n**News confirmation and catalyst(s):**On Friday Lebron James announced he\u2019s switching his KO sponsorship to a PEP sponsorship--which probably played into this UOA.  Looking into this more, I saw that it's an energy drink play and he's now attached to Mountain Dew's Rise energy drink.  Maybe PEP gets some price upgrades since people saw how much of a beast MNST has traditionally been, maybe this starts some conversation around the sector as a whole on CNBC, or maybe neither of those things happen.  BUT, with a relatively safe stock making a big name play leading into earnings, I'm willing to lose a little theta for a week to see if anything plays out.\n\n**Position**: A relatively safe PEP 145c 2/12 while I play the waiting game for a week or so and reevaluate.  If it's smooth sailing, likely hold for a bit into the earnings run and sell before.\n\n**FB\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**: [Underlying= 251.36 / b: 252.50c, 257c 1/22, others (IV: 38% for 1/22, ~50% for 1/29)](https://i.imgur.com/gGXVZTA.jpg)\n\n**Unusual Whale alert**: No\n\n**Earnings Report**: 1/27\n\n**Why I like it:** Welcome to earnings season for big tech, and FB is a steal right here.  They\u2019ve been pummelled, fairly or unfairly, in the \"censorship\" aftermath and is at a great level to bounce...you can't cuck the Zuck.  I have been seeing Fb calls with their own hedges trickle in like this since Wednesday and Thursday nonstop--there was some bad What's App backlash to their new privacy policy, but if anything that will be a tastier dip for Monday entry that is to be bought. \n\n**IV and the greeks:** slightly elevated IV because ER is coming, but fine.  Still plenty of room for an upward trajectory on IV/Vega.  The premium for 1/29 is a tad bit pricey, so if you can't afford that I'd look at a vertical call spread capping at 255 if you're going to play it with a close expiration.\n\n**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** What's App issue is a potential albatross for tomorrow, but I do believe this will be a relatively smooth upward earning trajectory.  Also, their Oculus 2 demand numbers are going be through the roof and has great meme potential.  I don't usually hold through ER, but I may keep a lotto for this.  Been hovering around MA200, ready to bounce bounce.\n\n**Position:** FB 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c\n\n**DVN \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**: underlying= 19.57 / **Orders**: 19.50, 20c, 21.50 1/22, many others with exp. from now to May. (IV high, around 100% on ATM weeklies) \n[DVN UOA](https://i.imgur.com/VL7iirc.jpg)\n\n**Unusual Whales alert**: Yes\n\n**Earnings Report:** Feb 16th\n\n**Why I like it:** I've been seeing it pop up so much in clusters I can't ignore it any Longer. The volume has been intense in the whole sector.  [This Barron's article confirmed the activity I've been around energy.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-energy-could-have-a-tesla-like-2021-51610744972)  They compare it to TSLA--yes, TSLA.\n\n**IV and the greeks**: IV is getting a bit high because of the overall energy spike, but I have confidence it's heading higher.  The bid/ask spread is problematic, though.  Will enter low and hope the order gets bought on a dip.\n\n**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** aside from the call activity and the Barron's article pump, we have the inauguration for Biden to lay out a true vision for energy.  Early indications are that while solar, EV, etc are the hot names there is a place for truly evolving big oil companies.  They also just completed a merger on January 7th. Plus we have a nice dip tomorrow as an entry point with the Keystone news\n\n**Positions**:  This is one that you buy LEAPS or monthlies on-- I'm looking at **2/19 121.5c and 3/19 121.5c **but I fully acknowledge that the bid/ask spread is a bitch at the moment.\n\n**A list:**\n\n[EDIT \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80](https://i.imgur.com/hgjrLgU.jpg): underlying = 76.14 / **Order**: 1/22 85c (IV 116%) \n\n**Why I Like It:** Ever since I missed the NIO/PLUG everything EV launch a couple months back, I've been looking for the next industry to go off.  Energy is one of my choices, the other is whatever the fuck is going on with Gene Editing.  Genetically constructed super-babies, so hot right now. I know ARKG exists as well, I consider that a part of this play too. \n\n**IV and the Greeks:** Unideal for the short term, as under 100% is a general rule of thumb, but I really like this as a long term hold--so much so that I'm going to recommend the S word here (ssssssshares).\n\n**Confirmation and catalyst(s):**  [Barron's came out with this piece over the weekend,](https://www.barrons.com/articles/with-rare-speed-gene-editing-emerges-as-biotechs-new-cutting-edge-51610655079) which is part of what I'm sure that whale was chasing. \n\n>While gene-editing start-ups will lose money during years of clinical trials, it\u2019s hard to say the stocks are overvalued. If their one-time interventions can cure diseases that otherwise require chronic treatment\u2014or lack any treatment at all\u2014then the stocks will fly. \n\n**Position**: Opening up two LEAPs if I can get a dip so the 1/20/22 ask is only around 2,300.  Will chase on a 2/5 77 because the bid/ask spread on that strike is (relatively) reasonable and it feels doable. If this one is pricey for you consider call debit spreads.\n\n**Two interesting trends from Friday UOA that I\u2019m trying to connect some dots on:**\n\n[1) Cruiseline puts were everywhere](https://i.imgur.com/AOuseNk.jpg)\n\nI saw this enough that it made me think.  My hunch was that a lot of bad COVID recovery-stonk news is coming during inauguration (plus global trends).  That contrasted a little with the second interesting trend...\n\n[2) Vaccines all got Unusual call options at various times](https://i.imgur.com/Z1AfJuF.jpg)\nI saw MRNA got some UK upgrade attention today--maybe that was some of the reason, maybe that was none of the reason, but interesting nonetheless.\n\nI checked Unusual Whales to see if they have any cruise alerts and they had the opposite of the orders I saw--a CCL 1/29 call alerted.  They also had MRNA 2/5 145 calls.  I'm going to stay away from the cruise puts, and probably go with some MRNA and NVAX 2/5 calls, slightly OTM depending where we open up.  It seems like the cruise puts were a hedge for a good week for vaccines. \n\n**Open Interest change notables**:\n\n1) **Oil** saw huge OI increases for January and Feb expirations (XOM, PBR, etc).\n\n2) **Uber** had huge OI increase for 2/19 both calls and puts.  Earning are 2/10\n\n3) **F** and **GM** having obvious increases from their big splashes\n\n4) **SRNE** had serious volume as well and lots of sporadic call buys\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Other options I saw I liked:** **BZUN 2/19 45c** **FEYE** 1/22 25c I will play as a 2/5, **WKHS** 25c 2/5\n\n**Positions:**\n\n**PEP** 145c 2/12\n\n**FB** 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c\n\n**DVN** 2/19 21.5c and 3/19 121.5c\n\n**EDIT**: 2/5 77c\n\n**INO/NVAX/MRNA** take your pick (Cruise puts hedge)\n**EDIT: JUST NOTICED A 170c 1/22 NVAX I MISSED**\n\n**VXX**: 1/29 18c and 19c. bigly hedged for inauguration shenigans. \n\n*waiting for a dip for some of these because I\u2019m\nNervous about Thursday.* \n\n**TLDR**:\nEnergy, Gene editing, and Vaccines were all trending on Friday UOA.  FB has been getting a lot of call activity as well ahead of earnings.  PEP looks good for a run too on the heels of Lebron James signing pre-earnings.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n*This doesn\u2019t update so I\u2019ll put screenshots and stuff if more interesting stuf comes in when I check in the daily thread.

That contrasted a little with the second interesting trend...</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Z1AfJuF.jpg\">2) Vaccines all got Unusual call options at various times</a>\nI saw MRNA got some UK upgrade attention today--maybe that was some of the reason, maybe that was none of the reason, but interesting nonetheless.</p>\n\n<p>I checked Unusual Whales to see if they have any cruise alerts and they had the opposite of the orders I saw--a CCL 1/29 call alerted.  They also had MRNA 2/5 145 calls.  I&#39;m going to stay away from the cruise puts, and probably go with some MRNA and NVAX 2/5 calls, slightly OTM depending where we open up.  It seems like the cruise puts were a hedge for a good week for vaccines. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Open Interest change notables</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>1) <strong>Oil</strong> saw huge OI increases for January and Feb expirations (XOM, PBR, etc).</p>\n\n<p>2) <strong>Uber</strong> had huge OI increase for 2/19 both calls and puts.  Earning are 2/10</p>\n\n<p>3) <strong>F</strong> and <strong>GM</strong> having obvious increases from their big splashes</p>\n\n<p>4) <strong>SRNE</strong> had serious volume as well and lots of sporadic call buys</p>\n\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other options I saw I liked:</strong> <strong>BZUN 2/19 45c</strong> <strong>FEYE</strong> 1/22 25c I will play as a 2/5, <strong>WKHS</strong> 25c 2/5</p>\n\n<p><strong>Positions:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>PEP</strong> 145c 2/12</p>\n\n<p><strong>FB</strong> 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c</p>\n\n<p><strong>DVN</strong> 2/19 21.5c and 3/19 121.5c</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: 2/5 77c</p>\n\n<p><strong>INO/NVAX/MRNA</strong> take your pick (Cruise puts hedge)\n<strong>EDIT: JUST NOTICED A 170c 1/22 NVAX I MISSED</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>VXX</strong>: 1/29 18c and 19c. bigly hedged for inauguration shenigans. </p>\n\n<p><em>waiting for a dip for some of these because I\u2019m\nNervous about Thursday.</em> </p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong>:\nEnergy, Gene editing, and Vaccines were all trending on Friday UOA.  FB has been getting a lot of call activity as well ahead of earnings.  PEP looks good for a run too on the heels of Lebron James signing pre-earnings.</p>\n\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n\n<p><em>This doesn\u2019t update so I\u2019ll put screenshots and stuff if more interesting stuf comes in when I check in the daily thread.  I try to update these on my twitter as well @yourboymit.  Mods, trying to be helpful since there are no edit notifications, not shilling or selling anything.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Go Bengals</em>.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort":
