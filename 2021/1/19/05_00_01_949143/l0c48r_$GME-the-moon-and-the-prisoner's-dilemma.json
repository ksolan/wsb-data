There exists a meaningful cohort of uncommitted retards, for whom only a scientific explanation will make them believe.\n\nEnter - The Prisoner's dilemma. The Prisoner's dilemma is a hypothetical scenario, where two rational actors don't cooperate and by acting in their self-interest, don't produce the most ideal outcome. The classic example put forth by economists and mathematicians is when two bank robbers, placed in solitary confinement and sans communication with each other, are faced with a decision.  The prosecutor lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the main charge, but they have enough to convict both to lesser offenses. In this example, the prosecutors negotiate with the prisoner and make an offer. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by confessing that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with each other by remaining silent.\n\nOutcome #1) When one prisoner confesses and the other remains silent, the confessor goes free and his accomplice receives 20 years behind bars.\n\nOutcome #2) Both prisoners confess, they both receive 5 years.\n\n**Outcome #3 and the ideal outcome) Both prisoners remain silent and only receive 1 year each.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fig 1. for illiterate retards](https://preview.redd.it/h5t19j8m57c61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e91ef2db00068e95dd2e23a4d8f2a25a7eca6d27)\n\nThe most ideal outcome is through cooperation with both prisoners serving only 1 year, but academics in various fields, such as John Mearsheimer, the father of neorealism in international politics, would state that blah blah blah shut the fuck up, you know exactly where I'm going with this shit.\n\nIn the case of the VW short squeeze, there were only a handful of shareholders that controlled the float, where engineering a short squeeze was all but certain.  In our case, the number of shareholders is significantly higher to include our lord and savior Ryan Cohen, boomer institutions(Scion, Hestia, Vanguard, etc) and the million strong soldiers of r/wallstreetbets. While one can be critical of my explanation stating that this is in fact a N-person prisoner's dilemma, because they're a  **\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b** with a PhD in the social sciences, or argue that r/wallstreetbets is a community of rational actors, I would like to offer some counter-arguments.\n\n**First**, the soldiers of r/wallstreetbets are not rational.

Boomer brokerages like schwab and fidelity are cockteasing some of you with increased interest rates to loan your shares to the likes of Melvin Capital. Don't.
