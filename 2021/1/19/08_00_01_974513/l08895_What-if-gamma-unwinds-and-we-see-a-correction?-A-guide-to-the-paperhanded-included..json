{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "So you know how the market has been edging up without a large retrace ever since the November lows? A lot of this has been linked to vaccine hopes and huge amount of cash looking for tendies. Crucially, it's also linked to huge volumes of call options being bought. If a dealer/market maker (MM) sells you calls, he wants to keep the tendies without taking any risk. So to hedge the risk of selling the calls and seeing the underlying rise, he needs to hedge his risk by buying the underlying (either stocks or index futures). The # of shares he needs to buy depends on the gamma - gamma is higher when the stock price moves closer to the strike price.\n\nIf call volume increase, dealer buying of the underlying stocks also increases, further lifting the stocks. This is basically what wsb used to be about before Melvin restricted rocket rides to shares only. \n\n**Much words, few points, you say.** Getting to it. So what happens if a factor that has been supporting the markets suddenly weakens or completely reverses? A bear move doesn't need a lot of sellers, it just needs a lack of buying at current levels, a small correction. Dealers unwinding their positions would add to the sales and we could see a fast plunge. Add to that the record amount margin loans and you have quite the laxative cocktail. This could be ugly as fuck.\n\nI'm eyeing the area of 3244 - 3300 on $SPX as an area of ultimate support. A massive amount of stops are sitting below that area - it's a double bottom formed in September and November.

I don't want to tie up too much of my capital on expensive SPY puts, so I'll be looking to get some IWM puts or maybe some gourd shorts. \n\n**Wait, but what about BB, GME, PLTR?** The above is based on the S&P500 and options flows. A short squeeze doesn't need permission from the index or Melvin. Individual stocks don't need to follow the index 1 to 1 if there are other supporting factors.
