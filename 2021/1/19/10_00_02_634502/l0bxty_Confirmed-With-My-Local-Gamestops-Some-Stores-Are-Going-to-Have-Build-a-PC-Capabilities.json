{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I wanted to do my own research of u/ethandavid's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/)\n\nI went to two Gamestops in my large metropolitan area. The first one, they confirmed that those type of stores are coming, but they are also changing some Gamestops to be more of a gaming lounge, where people can hang out and game. They mentioned the stores would also have snack and drinks to buy and some of the stores have already switched over to having that, but because of COVID they are very few of them.\n\nThe second Gamestop I visited happened to be one of the ten busiest Gamestops in the country (unrelated but they said they had a great holiday season). She also confirmed that the some stores are going to become what was described in u/ethandavid's post. Which is a place people can come in and an employee will work/walk them through the process of buying parts to build a PC. And parts will be sold at Gamestops.\n\nShe described the idea as being similar to what Microcenters' offer but the inverse. So they will still be mainly console gaming but have a small but good collection of PC parts and people knowledgeable about it. And those knowledgeable people will walk through people buying parts to build a PC. The goal is Summer 2021 for the switch to happen, but depending on COVID and vaccination rates it could be pushed to Fall 2021.\n\nI did ask about Cohen being a CEO, and she said she did not know, but she would not be surprised if that happened.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI am incredibly bullish on this move as it is a niche that isn't really explored at a large scale. Microcenters offer something similar, but their footprint is really small. And Best Buy doesn't have a dedicated area or people for that. And it helps to somewhat insulate them from people moving to PC gaming as they can sell them the equipment they will need to game.\n\nLast point that I do not see a lot of talk about is their collectables and TCG (Pokemon, Magic, etc). Real disposable income per capita in the U.S. has gone up by about 6 percent year-to-date from last year. Right now, it's on track to reach the fastest rate of growth since 1984. There are numerous reasons for that but the increase in federal unemplotment and the $1200 helped, along with most services being shut down, people used that money to buy goods such as collectables. One exampole is funk pops, which she mentioned sell very well and people constantly come into the store to purchase funko pops because they like to browse. People in store means people might buy other stuff outside of collectables. Another example is Pokemon cards, where the prices and demand for cards are fucking stupid crazy high, like prices going up 100s and even 1000s of % in the past 6 months alone. Going to a Target looking for Pokemon cards is like looking for TP at the beginning of the pandemic. Which leads to my point about TCG, Gamestop has a surprisingly decent card offering including exclusive products and offering preorders. She mentioned that people would come in and just buy all of the Pokemon cards and that they restock multiple times a DAY because demand is so high. Multiple desirable sets will be released this year, and people will go into Gamestops to preorder and might pick up something else while they are looking. \n\nThe big point about the collectables is that people still like to browse for collectables driving people to the store, TCG cards like Pokemon drives people in to the store, and people will continue to collect even after the pandemic. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTL;DR Some Gamestops are soon going to be a hangout center and a place where people can build a PC/buy parts as soon as Summer 2021.
