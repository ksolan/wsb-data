{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Hello, my favourite paste-eating, rocket-posting children. In a few hours, the market opens, and the flood gates will begin. I'm all for GME, both for the MOASS and the long-term outlook of the company. I have been theory crafting all weekend, reading every fucking DD, Discussion, and Shitpost since August 2020 post to this god-forsaken Subreddit and there is one simple fact that is currently not being discussed. I'll start off with a TL,DR and then go from there.\n\nTL,DR: Bears are undeniably fucked, You control the power, GME is not going to the moon, but to the edge of the fucking observable universe.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nLet's go, Gamestop has a NEGATIVE Float. There is likely not an original Gamestop issued share left on the market. What do I mean? Per my last post, I told you that there are approx 69.75 million OG shares, and approx \\~75 Million shares owned by insiders (board of directors)/top 10 institutions\\[1\\]. meaning the likelihood of the shares that you, me, and DeeEffVee own are a shorted share. What I failed to emphasize, is the ABSOLUTE SHEER MAGNITUDE of the situation. There is no way that shorts can get themselves out of it. They're only going to be buying back their shorted shares which, since they are above 100%, there is no way to do that, unless institutions sell off everything they own into the open market. Which is unlikely, as institutions are in it for a long haul, but there may be some trimming on the way up. \n\nI've commonly simplified this potential squeeze as 100 PS5s(common shares) and 134 PS5 buyers(shorts), but I've had an epiphany that it is wrong. The 100 PS5s are already purchased, sitting in the institution/insider's homes and more than likely, the shares that are out there being traded have been created by the shorts. Where the fuck am I going with this? THERE ARE NO PS5s LEFT AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU AND I ARE PLAYING WITH IS A SHORTED SHARE. THERE IS NO TRUE FLOAT LEFT, AND NOW WE ARE PLAYING AROUND WITH FUCKING IOUs. We still have legal ownership, and voting power with our shares, but they've been created out of the borrowing process of shorting a share, and not a genuine OG share. I reiterate, Gamestop is essentially in a Negative float % position.\n\nNow, what does that mean for the outcome of the situation? bringing up some data that u/TitusSupremus provided on his last post, we can see that of the 79,519,042 shorted shared, 68% or 54,168,330 of all shorted shares are shorted on margin. Some of which are naked shorted shares, which of course, is an illegal activity when not covered within a 3 day timeframe. (we are at trading day #27.) With many brokerages starting to increase their margin requirements, and maintenance %'s. Brokers will force a buy-to-close on short positions on behalf of the shorts. This is going to cause a snowball effect, coupled with the SEC 201 (Up-Tick Rule enacted until EOD Tuesday 01/19/2021).\n\nI have two theories of what may happen tomorrow/this week\n\n1)Margin call happens, we have an increase of buying pressure due to all you loyal GME DiamondHands, along with retail and investment F.O.M.O., ALONG WITH MARGIN CALLED SHORTS WHO CAN'T CLEAR UP ENOUGH CAPITAL TO COVER THEIR POSITIONS, all the buying pressure means that price goes up and our friend SEC 201, more brokers are going to buy-to-close, etc. etc. taking us well beyond $420.69 and into the territory of whatever price you want to sell at. \n\n2)We remain fairly flat, since shorts can only sell on the up-tick, throughout the day, as brokers are allowing shorts to clear up capital on other investments to cover their margin call. More illegal shorting occurs, and shorts double down on their position even greater. Wednesday and beyond, just spikes and dips like we\u2019ve seen since last week on an upward trend. \n\nPositions: 1000 shares @ 15.84\n\n\\[1\\][ https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME)", "author_fullname": "t2_3dlb7l0x", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "GME Negative Float.
