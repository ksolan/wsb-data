The only significant dips in the stock price under his leadership appear to have been cyclical and correlate with greater market dips/crashes. He has an MBA from Harvard, which should be a strike against him, but he\u2019s a bit old school so that\u2019s ok. **\ud83d\ude80**\n\nNow we come to **Dolf Berle, the former Dave & Busters cowboy who currently helms Topgolf** and [still has a Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dolf-berle-b475b111/). First of all, his name is fucking Dolf; not to be mistaken with Dolph Lundgren, but equally if not more badass. **Our Dolf is a decathlete and he competed on American Ninja Warrior.** Put him in a ring with Tim Cook, Elon Musk, and Alex Karp, and see who comes out. I fucking dare you. He also has an MBA from Harvard, which should also be a strike against him, but he also has an MA in African Studies from the University of Zimbabwe, which only elicits autism in its purest form. Although Dolf will likely be leaving the company following the merger, there is no doubt he has left his imprint on our baby. **\ud83d\ude80**\n\nLet\u2019s make magic happen my retards.
