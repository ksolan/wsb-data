{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**TLDR: Stock very volatile. Bulls need consistent price increases to not get clubbed by MMs, until around 50, where option dealers/MMs will naturally help from that point until Friday. Friday will tend to significantly reverse whatever happened this week if movements were large (30%+). Bears should not get greedy under 27 or 26. Most price action early this morning was MM driven.  Gamma dead zones are seeming to trap the stock - the long hang at 38 was one such dead zone, then it shot through to 41.50, another dead zone - price does not want to be 38.50-41.50 for long because of gamma! Trading before dead zones in your favor (buying under a ramp, selling over a ramp) in this environment.**\n\nThis post is about the market maker positions in GME, and the effects that will have on the market. Recall that last week, MMs probably accounted for as much as 2/3 of the price action, acting as a lever for WSB's wipe out of a lot of short positions.\n\nRight now, I believe dealers are massively long. I don't have great tools to calculate, but my guess is long about 10-15m shares. They are of course loaning these shares out to shorts, and making bank doing it since the lending rate is at 30% right now, with not a lot of shares available to short. This also means that if you buy puts from an MM, it's easy for them to hedge it - they just reduce their long.\n\nIn terms of what dealers will do as time goes on, you need to understand gamma ramps. Gamma ramps are prices where there are a LOT of open interest of options. As prices cross up over these, dealers (if they are short options, which I think they are and evidence suggests they are), have to buy like crazy. As price declines, they also sell like crazy. Gamma giveth, gamma taketh away.\n\nAt open today, I believe dealers had to buy about 5.5 million shares between open and the stock hitting $44. In other words, they were the majority of the price action over that range, fueled by WSB bid forcing them to in turn buy more stock. But this gamma is a negative too - as people sold positions or sold their ITM calls, dealers dumped stock back, and gamma kicked in, plummeting the stock back to the 38 range quite quickly.\n\nAs I mentioned last week, the heavy concentration of options at $39 and $40 mean that crossing these prices up or down is very easy, while crossing other prices is harder.\n\nBelow is a map of current gamma structure. It's written to represent puts below and calls on top, but really, it should be both below because I think dealers are extremely short options here (sold people calls AND puts).  These ramps, like I said, represent areas where price will move very quickly (and in the adjacent dollar to them really, but sharpest right at the price)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/nHm1eqU](https://imgur.com/a/nHm1eqU)\n\nNext up is the is the map of options expiring this week. This is important because at the end of the week, anything in the money somewhat rolls off the MM books (some exercised, some rolled, but last friday was selling on similar effects, so would expect the same dynamic, which is selling if price up a lot, buying if price down a lot). If there are a lot of ITM calls, you expect selling Friday. If there are a lot of ITM puts, you expect buying Friday. Additionally, as the week goes on, ITM and OTM options sort of purify their impact. An OTM call today is going to be hedged by a MM with a long stock postiion. But as the week goes on, they hedge less since it becomes less likely. Similarly, an OTM put today is hedged with a short position. That'll be reduced over the week. For ITM positions, those go from partially hedged to fully hedged throughout the week.  Right now, there are a lot more near-term OTM call positions than puts, so the natural hedging behavior of MMs will be to sell stock unless the price is climbing quickly.\n\nHere is this week's chart and next week's chart. You'll notice this week matters a lot more.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/of2oqCX](https://imgur.com/a/of2oqCX)\n\n**Overall trading dynamics:**\n\n\\- Putting this really simply, if we go from $38 to $60, MMs would have to buy something like 13 or 14m shares. If we fall to 27, they will sell but less, maybe 9 or 10m shares. The gamma structure is slightly supportive of the bull ramp, but also can facilitate bear. So, ultimately, we can move fast, but it depends on the actions of investors - WSB buying vs old value holders liquidating shares, new short sellers, etc. I don't know what value investors are doing, but recall that when people were buying this at 5-10, they talked about price targets in the teens or even lower. We see circumstantial evidence of value trimming and selling, which is probably the main force in opposition of WSB buying.\n\n\\- Option dealers / MMs will make a lot of money if the stock closes around at a not high price this week due to the massive OI they'd have to hedge. It's not in their interest to get to the 20s necessarily, but they will make money more easily if short interest stays high, and this doesn't get into the 40s.  They love this situation because they are loaning out shares at a crazy borrow rate (since they are long the stock).\n\n\\- This does make the price vulnerable to options manipulation. Were someone to go out and buy a bunch of $45 puts right now, $100m of capital would in turn shoot 12m shares down, triggering more selling, probably causing a 24m sell to $27. Very tempting for a hedge fund. The same could happen in reverse on calls though. A similar strength ITM call buy would send the price to the 50s.\n\n\\- Crossing 39/40 is easy. I expect lots of ping-ponging around it.\n\n\\- Crossing multiples of 5 is easy, while in between numbers are harder and are gamma dead zones where stock will move more slowly and languish at times.\n\n\\- For bulls and bears - Buying or selling around ramps is probably sensible. For a bull, you'd want to buy right under a ramp that can shoot up price, such as 38.75 or something. For a bear, you'd want to sell right after a ramp, like at 42 or 41.5.\n\n\\- For bulls: Realistically, getting to low 40s is easy. Getting to low 50s is harder but entirely possible. Getting to 61/62 is also possible (Though harder still), but it's a heavy lift past that because there isn't OI there, and at that point, would require huge amounts of new money or short squeeze to happen.\n\n\\- For bears:  I'd say you are getting real greedy if you hold puts past the high 20s, because there's not a lot of gamma there, and there's a lot of short-cover motivation.\n\n**Weekly Options Expiration Trading Dynamics**\n\nBecause there are many options expiring again this week, the effect of these and next weeks options decaying is important. Basically, as time goes forward towards expiration, the options look more and more like either a pure long or short position or a distant option, and hedging follows. Right now, a near the money call will be heavily hedged with stock, but by Friday, it will hardly be hedged at all. That means ITM calls that are near the money cause buying, OTM calls cause selling, ITM puts cause selling, OTM puts cause buying.\n\nLooking at the current trading expirations, it would appear that at price levels before about 44 or 45, the options dealers/MMs are going to be dumping shares as they de-hedge all those calls you guys bought, and this is elevated in the 30s in general. After that, it starts to be the opposite of net buying. So for bulls, you really need to get the price up to 50, preferably 55, pretty fast for these effects to work in your favor. For bears, you kind of can expect that a stable price in the high 30s has a good chance of causing de-hedge into the 35 ramp, and then down to 30. I believe you start to get the opposite of net buying around 30 as time goes forward without price movement, but I'm not precisely sure.\n\nGoing into Friday, I'll post an update, but in general, there will be some reversal of whatever is ITM. If we were at 60, I'd definitely be selling into Friday. If we were at 25, I'd definitely be buying into Friday.\n\nI should mention that the effects here are less powerful than last weeks, which were 2/3 responsible for the massive 126% meltup. Last week had a huge block of expiring options and just more OI in general. But, I still think MMs will be a major, maybe dominant, force this week.\n\nI was told I needed this to prevent a ban:   \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n*Also, I think MOASS is very close to impossible, even if $60 is possible. But that's another discussion, that probably isn't possible with the downvote environment. TLDR is that dealers have a lot of shares they are lending, institutions hedge all the time and very high prices mean they end up sitting on 20m+ shares, and bidding past $60 is a really heavy lift largely unassisted by gamma.*\n\n*Positions: still short with puts, $38 strike. This post's information is slightly bullish actually assuming momentum continues. My reason for being bearish is not relevant to this post, and I got downvoted on that elsewhere. No, I don't work for Melvin, they have no position now as far as we know - their puts expired worthless last Friday, and their actions all made you bulls about $3 a share FYI by contributing to price reduction pre last week, then helping fuel the massive gamma squeeze last week.*", "author_fullname": "t2_2ksvu6ky", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Updated 1-19-2021 GME Gamma and OI Dynamics - Slightly Bullish, Very Volatile", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_l0ofiu", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 81, "total_awards_received": 4, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 81, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1611078831.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 3}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1611105735.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>TLDR: Stock very volatile.
