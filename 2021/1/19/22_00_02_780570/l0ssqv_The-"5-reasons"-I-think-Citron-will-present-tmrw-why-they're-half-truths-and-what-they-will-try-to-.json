If you wish to award this post, please also buy a GME share or something at Gamestop.\n\nObligatory emoji:  \ud83d\ude80 \n\nObligatory position: GME 266 shares @$36.54 avg\n\nBefore I get into this, I need to say two things first. One, shorters will keep shorting, they're in too deep. Second, they will also do their absolute best to make ANYONE ELSE sell or short too, and they've had years of practice on how to manipulate people.\n\n# Reason 1: GME is a mall-store blockbuster (no future), will cite earnings reports\n\nPlease see this [very extensive Due Diligence (DD)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/) along with this [fascinating new development](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/).\n\nGME is on a trajectory to do some pretty cool things, even without the short squeeze that has everyone excited. Long buyers are in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost likely things they will cite are:\n\n1) Total sales declined 3.1% in the holiday sales report\n\n2) Large 3rd quarter sales declines (pre-covid vs post-covid the most likely cause).\n\n3) Closed 11% of stores (which they did to cut underperforming stores, and because their stores are FAR too dense, especially given an increased focus on E-commerce)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost likely things they will intentionally leave out:\n\n1) Comparable store sales increased 4.8% in holiday report (so, decrease likely because of store closures)\n\n2) E-commerce is at 34% of company sales, equivalent to Best Buy percentage (and growing rapidly, and more rapidly than Best Buy)\n\n3) Regional sales in Australia/New Zealand (no covid) went UP 31%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Reason 2: Insiders are selling\n\nThis is true. But here are the facts that they will leave out:\n\n1/12/21-1/13/21: Hestia Capital (whose managing member is Wolf Kurt James) sold 945,550 shares of GME for this reason \"in order to better align with the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of Hestia Capital\". The fund still owns 91,000 shares and Wolf Kurt James PERSONALLY AND DIRECTLY still owns 50,689 (including 20,000 of his wife's shares).\n\nAlso,\n\n1/13/21: Dunn Lizabeth sold 5,000 shares of GME. She still owns 57,258.\n\n1/13/21-1/14/21: Raul J Fernandez sold 34,619 shares of GME. He still owns 32,789.\n\n1-13-21: Kathy P Vrabeck sold 50,000 shares of GME. She still owns 79,537.\n\nThe forms regarding the previous 3 people's sales were all filed by Dunn Lizabeth, suggesting that they sold as a coordinated choice. Also, all three of those people are NOT on the Board of Directors as proposed by RC Ventures (and conditionally agreed to by Gamestop, an agreement they'll almost definitely keep given the huge increases in share price upon RC Ventures' buy-in and policy changes that RC Ventures has strongly suggested/recommended)\n\nSource: [SEC Filings](https://sec.report/Ticker/GME)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Reason 3: This is a pump and dump sneaky nonsense by WSB\n\nFirst, lol. The people on this sub don't have anything like that sort of buying power (especially not if we take out the people that actually believe in GameStop). More importantly, see reason #1 (especially the part about outstanding short interest).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Reason 4: The short squeeze has already happened\n\nNow here, I expect them to throw up some really shady data analysis looking at shares shorted or available to short or short interest % of daily trading and try and pretend like that number really means that the shorts have already covered. Here's the important data (there's some in the DD in #1 as well).\n\nFirst, [Short interest was higher than float as of EOD Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzwo2z/gme_short_interest_declined_to_71m_and_some_other/), meaning it would take DAYS of trading to cover. We'll see updated numbers for Tuesday soon. Short interest actually INCREASED during the Wed-Thurs time that Citron will likely try to say was the short squeeze. Now, these are Ortex estimates based on the self-reported shares short at a large aggregate of brokerages, but have been very reliable  when compared to the official SEC data that comes out every half a month.\n\nThe point being that it is extremely, extremely likely that shorts HAVE NOT covered, and have in fact DOUBLED DOWN ON SHORTING TO DRIVE DOWN THE PRICE. Meanwhile, it is further likely that long buyers have locked in MORE shares so the real % short/float is higher than we would expect on the assumption that every float share is really not locked down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Reason 5: I expect this to be a meme reason (cuz they had 4 and needed 5 to make it sound good)\n\nBut otherwise, it'll be an extension of reason 1 or something to do with SEC regulations or something nonsensical. Will update to respond if necessary.\n\n# So what will happen?\n\n**THIS IS A GUESS. But, based on the sudden vanishing of shares available to short at IKBR at approximately the same time as the Citron announcement, I suspect tomfoolery. In addition, Citron just started doing these \"twitter Live\" things two days ago. Yes, GME wasn't the first one, but it's still a very recent new thing. At the same time, GME has had some barefaced manipulation these past few days on this sub and elsewhere in the media, not to mention the likely** [months of naked shorting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky9mu0/gme_comrades_115_update_27_consecutive_days_on/)\n\nOption 1: we have a repeat of Friday where shorters will try to immediately and early smash down GME price in hopes that it will keep going down after starting that trajectory. They can do this because SEC Rule 201 expires after today (so they can short on a downtick again).\n\nOption 2: Shorters will first allow stocks to rise as they did today. Then at around 11:30 (+/- 1 hour), GME will start to tank. If it was me, I would time it and hit it very hard so it hits -10% for the day (the furthest they can push it by shorting on downticks) as close to the Citron announcement as possible, with the hopes that that livestream will then push retail shorters to short more or paper-handers to sell.\n\nThis is all assuming no input from Ryan Cohen or GME, so any kind of announcement or tweet would throw a wrench in my predictions.
