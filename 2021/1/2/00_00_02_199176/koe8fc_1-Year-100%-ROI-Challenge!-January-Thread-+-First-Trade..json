The more experienced among you will know achieving such consistently high returns will be an incredibly difficult feat. I put my odds of success somewhere around 20% to be honest. But it will be a good education for both of us. Really, I only need to achieve around 6% return every month to break 100% by the end of the year (after compounding), and put in those terms the task doesn't sound so daunting, does it?\n\nStill, I will be forced to make some very aggressive, downright risky plays in order to make this remotely possible. If my wheeling ETF guide was about a safe, conservative strategy, this guide will be the opposite. Keep that in mind if you are foolish enough to copy my trades. \n\nWish me luck... I will need it.\n\n# Basic Strategy\n\nI will not leave any tool off the table here. If I see an opportunity, I will take it. But for the majority of my trades I will be using a very simple strategy. Find high implied volatility stonks and sell options on them. I will typically be selling cash-secured puts since naked calls carry excess risk, which means I want to look for stocks I am generally bullish on long-term.\n\nUsing ToS I've set up some very basic filters to scan for promising stocks to trade:\n\n**1) Option Implied Volatility >80% (for tendies)**\n\n**2) Stock Volume >5,000,000 (for liquidity)**\n\n**3) Market Cap >$1B (to comply with WSB rules)**\n\n**4) Stock Price <$82 (collateral maximum)**\n\nScanning with these filters brings up a lot of familiar names: GME, PLTR, QS, NKLA, LAZR, FCEL, UVXY, ACB, XPEV, SPCE, and so on. In other words, the type of stonks retards like you are buying expensive options on...\n\n# Running the Numbers\n\nI will try to not get too technical and into the weeds with this experiment. I'll be using some very basic math to decide which options to sell. I highly recommend you play around with the numbers on options to really get an intuitive feel for how they work. For example, if I were to ask you what happens to the relative cost of premium ($/day) as DTE increases on an option, what would be your answer? If you don't know, just run some simple numbers to find out...\n\nSPY premium / DTE = $/day\n\n332 / 5 = 66.4\n\n440 / 10 = 44\n\n652 / 21 = 31\n\n1915 / 140 = 13.7\n\nAs you can see, premium cost per day decreases as time till expiration increases. (It's more complicated than that of course, but we are keeping it simple here). For that reason I will be doing something I generally don't advocate: Selling weeklies to squeeze a bit of extra juice out of my options. This also means I will be holding them all to expiration to deal with issues like higher gamma.\n\nHere is another simple equation I can use to give me a lot of information:\n\n**(Premium \\* 365) / (DTE \\* Strike) = Max ROI**\n\nBasically what I'm doing is estimating the returns from selling the same option for an entire year with a 100% success rate. Since I'm aiming for 100% ROI, any options I sell will need to be over 100 in this formula. Of course, I won't have a 100% success rate on my trades, so I should probably aim even higher to give myself some buffer, maybe around 120. Let's try it on some \\~ATM options to get a relative comparison of option value:\n\nSPY: 12.2\n\nPSTH: 48.1\n\nGME: 140.5\n\nPLTR: 111.1\n\nQS: 263.7\n\nUVXY: 134.2\n\nDon't put too much stock in these numbers. I'm just using them as a simple comparative tool for judging the profitability of different options.\n\nWe can glean even more information from the above number if we multiply it by the Prob. ITM% of course, to get something closer to an \"Expected Value\" for an option, which I will perhaps go into more detail on next month.\n\nFinally I'll be throwing around various other calculations as I go, $/day, ROI/month, premium/collateral, and so on. I will need to watch all of these and more to reach my goal.\n\n# My First Trade\n\nLooking at the stocks in my filter, there are two that really stand out to me: GME and PLTR. That's right, everyones favorite meme stocks!\n\nGameStop is interesting as a short-term play, and has very high IV. But I'm not confident in the company as a long-term play, and would hate to be assigned hundreds of shares of that shitty brick and mortar hellscape. Palantir, on the other hand, has serious growth potential long-term and I would not mind being assigned. It has also been hit hard recently and is at a more reasonable entry level, which also makes it a good choice. **Therefore, I will be trading PLTR as my first play.**\n\nI want to sell an OTM put to give myself some downside protection against a further drop, but not so far OTM that I can't break my 100% ROI goal. Let's plug some of the Jan. 15 options into my formula above to get a breakdown of the potential ROI.\n\n21 strike: 74.2\n\n22 strike: 108.4\n\n22.5 strike: 131.9\n\n23 strike: 155.5\n\nEither the 22 or 22.5 strikes are right near the sweet spot we are looking for in terms of return. Of course conditions will likely change on Monday and I may need to reassess, but at the moment my current play seems to be:\n\n**Sell to Open 3 contracts of PLTR 22p 1/15.**\n\nIf Monday opens red it will be even better for us, since we get in at a cheaper price with likely higher IV on top. So I for one am praying for a bloody Monday for Palantir (sorry bagholders).\n\nOf course after selling 3 contracts at 22 strike, we will only have used $6600 of our $8000 capital. I may need to look for one more smallish trade on a stock in the $14 range to take full advantage of our capital. If GME drops on Monday we could consider a far OTM play there, for instance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR- I am going to double a small account, and you are going to watch.**\n\nI will update this post as plays are made, and will create a new post each month as a recap.
