This will hinder the collection of iPhone identifiers for advertisers ([IDFA](https://www.appsflyer.com/mobile-attribution-glossary/idfa/)), one of the primary things used to track users online.\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nPrimary Issues For Facebook From The iOS 14 Update\n\n1. **Bidding Issues:** As I stated above, Facebook is going to lose more and more data points as  time goes on, making it so that they aren't able to bid appropriately on someone like Johnny Bravo when he is scrolling through his insta feed. What does this mean? Insta may look at Johnny Bravo as a Joe Schmo and decide that he's not worth bidding up on, so Johnny Bravo will never see those ads of Playboy and Whey Protein that he would have bought if he got an ad for it. (Example for this: with the iOS14 update, Facebook loses its data points to Johnny Bravo's workout apps, so they had no way of knowing he would have been more likely to convert.\n2. **Creating Audiences:** Facebook is going to lose thousands of data points on its users, effectively making it harder to match these audiences into their appropriate buckets. Before, if someone had several golf apps on their phone, you could assume they were a golf lover more easily. Without being able to use that app data sharing, it will be much harder to know they like golf unless they follow several golfing pros / shows in Facebook.\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nWith the expectation that Facebook will become less efficient as time goes on and that certain lawsuits could negatively affect the company, many advertisers are looking for other viable options to put their ad dollars. There have been several social media competitors working to monetize their app and become the third wheel of digital marketing. Some of these companies include:\n\n* PINS - Pinterest \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n* SNAP - Snapchat \ud83d\ude80\n* TWTR - Twitter \ud83d\ude80\n* Twitch - (Owned by Amazon aka AMZN) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n* LNKD - LinkedIn (Owned by Microsoft aka MSFT) \ud83d\ude80\n* Hulu Ads - (Owned by Disney aka DIS) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n* TikTok - Not sure if correct, but you may be able to get shares [here](https://www.ig.com/en/shares/ipos/bytedance-tiktok-ipo) (ticker tbd, but pretty sure it will be ZOOMR \ud83d\ude80\n\nThe name of the game is trying figuring out which of these new channels will be the next to gain 5-10% more market share of ad spend from clients and which will be nothing more than moneyless pits since they do a terrible job at monetizing their app and creating engaging ads that lead to conversions for clients (looking at you SNAP and TikTok).\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nMY RECENT BACKGROUND (aka why should you even bother listening to this autist):\n\n* **Worked in digital marketing and finance for the last 5 years**, also took on several side jobs doing digital marketing for companies\n   * **I managed >$10 million in ad spend across various digital marketing channels (Google/Bing/Facebook/Shopping) over the last 30 days** and over >$40 million in ad spend over the last year\n   * I work with a team of Managers and Directors at my agency to help talk about new opportunities and keep up with digital marketing trends across all channels\n   * Using our >300 clients data, our company is able to look at macro trends at a faster rate, so we can quickly identify which new channels to focus our efforts in (Pinterest/TikTok/Snap/Twitch/etc.)\n      * This was highlighted over the last year or year and a half when we noticed a huge spike in companies using Pinterest as a primary channel for digital marketing. Only more and more companies are going to join into the race, this is just the beginning.\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\n# Any of these stocks or multiple could improve throughout the following years, but my money is on PINS \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n* Even with PINS recent run up in stock price, I think there is still plenty of time to buy this stock now.\n   * Our clients are continuing to spend more and more on the Pinterest ad platform and it is returning better performance metrics (ROAS/ROI) than most of the other mentioned channels.\n* Pinterest also relies on on targeting people based on boards they visit/follow/create, combined with using a search query method for ads, somewhat similar to Google's. **This means they don't have to rely as much on pixel data, like Facebook does, to create their audience targeting.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# I think the safest way to make money on PINS is to buy stocks for the long term, but I know that doesn't get some of your little schlongs hard enough.\n\n* Their next earnings are on 2/4/21(after hours) and ***I fully expect them to smash expectations just like McConnell's dad smashed that turtle to give birth to Mitch.***\n   * Look at PINS options that make sense to you for a little after earnings, preferably not 2/5, literally the day after earnings.
