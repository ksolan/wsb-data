A lot of people are bullish on solar, wind an EVs and are very bearish on big oil companies.

Not only they are nowhere near as enviromentally sustainable as nuclear power (because they need lots of terrain,  use 20x more resources than nuclear fission power plants, and there are recycling issues), but most importantly, these green plants depend on the sun shining and the wind blowing, so **they can only run and produce energy about 30% of the time.** The key here is that there is no real efficient way (no, pumping and dumping water is not efficient) to have these plants running without coupling them with fossil fuel burning regular plants, beacuse otherwise the electric power grid would be a mess. **So the real reason that all these oil companies are fine with the government shifting to green energy is that, to run this utopia of solar panels, wind turbines, and EVs, you'll still need their oil**. In fact, these companies are the ones that are lobbying politicians (in particular democrats, in the US case), persuading it to pursue this \"green\" bullshit instead of going with real less harmful choice, which is regular old nuclear energy.\n\n# The 2020 oil price shock benefits BIG oil companies in the long run\n\nThe oil price disaster in march might cause a short term problem with oil companies, but **BIG oil companies rubbed their hands**. Maybe the small oil companies or the ones with lots of debt can face problems and go out of business, but **the GIANT with a healthy balance sheet can survive the crisis and have even more market share**. You have to think about this as if oil companies were coffee shops. During corona, many closed and never opened again becaus eof bankrupcty, so the ones that had lots of cash available before the big hit, the big players like Starbucks, will benefit when there is full or partail reopening of the economy.\n\n# Oil demand will not shrink that much\n\nIf people knew that **oil is not just used for powering engines**, they probably wouldn't have such a negative outlook on oil demand. Guys, oil is fucking used to build anything that is made out of **plastic**. Even to make some **medications** you need stuff that comes from oil. To get all the useless shit that the west buys from India and China, you'll still need oil to power **container ships** that sail the ocean. Once this corona shit is over, people will still buy plane tickets to go on vacation. Sure, maybe business trips will take a permanent hit and there be slightly less demand due to the transition to \"green\", BUT, as we said earlier, green still needs it .... and we are still not adressing the elephant in the room: there are massive **emerging markets economies** growing in the worild today, a lot of second and third world countries that will still rely on oil for their initial growth for decades. These countries will offset the loss of demand from developed nations. Shit, general commodities prices have been skyrocketing recently. You wanna jump on steel gang and not on oil gang? The only way oil prices fall from here is if OPEC shits the bed.\n\n# The play\n\nAs long as this obsession for and complete ignorance and denial on how to solve climate change continues, and as long as the goverments of the west are corrupt and cannot see that they need to boost nuclear power and public transportation instead of solar, wind and EVs, big oil companies with a heathy balance sheet will be fine in the next decade. **Many oil companies are trading at or below book value, with massive dividend yields**, it won't stay like this forever.
