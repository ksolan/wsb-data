{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Hi fellow retards and autists,\n\nIt is time to quit lurking and give you a DD of my own: CRSR - Corsair Gaming, Inc.\n\nThis will be a long read, but fear not I will post a TL;DR section at the end.\n\nLets start off with something more trivial, but important nonetheless.\n\n1) Management: Maybe you do not know the site \u201cOwler\u201d but one of its features is that members of the website can rank CEOs. Andrew Paul (Corsair\u2019s CEO) has a rating of 92/100. Apart from Andrew the team consists of people believing in the brand and having proven to be successful. Read up on them https://www.corsair.com/us/en/team\n\n\n2) Market sentiment: It seems people have generally gotten scared last couple of days and letting their hands turn into paper. If you have any position in CRSR, keep it. If not it\u2019s a great time to buy. Although it would seem there is a bearish sentiment on the stock there actually isn\u2019t. Thanks to /u/maxfort86 for making a handy tool for checking options (seems to be down though at the moment) we can see there are actually a lot more call options than puts telling us the sentiment is bullish. Apart from options we can also turn to the general analyst price target on finance.yahoo being a $40,11. It also enjoys a Zacks rank of 1 - Strong buy.\nHeck even /u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT became a millionaire with the stock and loaded back in 5 days ago and although some people think he dumped, I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s going to ride it with me to a PT of $55-$60 unless it rockets hard and well than we\u2019ll just strap in for more %.\nSo even if it follows conservative analysts you can make over 10% in a pretty short term without actually making full on retarded plays.\n\n\n3) Earnings date: They crushed their last earning report and nothing tells us the next one is going to be different. It is estimated that they will report earnings feb 09, 2021. The moment they will report their earnings you know this sucker is gonna soar. They almost doubled their previous consesus EPS and the way things are going I believe they will beat it again easily since the next consesus EPS is still lower then the realised one for Q3 and as I said nothing really changed or will change by then. Corona still got a lot of people at home and more and more people are buying equipment for pcs and also breaking them through more (sometimes abusive) usage. More sales = more profit = stonk go up.\n\n\n4) Confirmation bias: Who doesn\u2019t love hearing they are right? Well everything is screaming that CRSR is going to make moves, yes it is discounted now and heck maybe it\u2019ll discount a little further a maximum of 10%, but the reward surely outweighs the risk on this one. Everyone is saying this is a must buy and will rise back sooner than later. Just look at finance.yahoo or zacks like I mentioned or any other of the gazilion sites that exist. None of them are saying this stock isn\u2019t going to go up, the contrary is very much true in this case.\n\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a professional or financial adviser, if you want to buy the stock because of the DD it is at your own risk. These are my convictions not a sure prediction of the market.\n\n\nPositions: 488 stocks @ 37,39, don\u2019t dabble in options.\n\n\nTL;DR; buy stonk, make money.
