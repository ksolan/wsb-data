{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**TLDR: There is a Senate runoff in Georgia on Jan. 5 that will determine which political party controls the Senate.   \nIf you are pretty sure about what the trajectory of the Georgia Senate Runoffs will be, you can make money. Scroll to the bottom for the plays.**  \n\n\n\n\n**Introduction:**  \nRecall the price action of QQQ (the tech etf we all know about) around Nov. 3. If you can't because you're that guy from the movie [Memento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)) , pull out your Robinhood app and follow along with me kid:\n\nOn the eve of the general election, when most polls indicated that it would be a Democratic sweep, **QQQ sat at $269.** The next day, with the election contested, **QQQ rocketed to $294.** It remained steady on Friday, before declining the next week. \n\nWhy did the election affect the price the way that it did? It is because Biden's legislative agenda depends on Democratic control of Congress. **In particular, a simple majority in the Senate allows President-elect Biden to raise corporate taxes to 28%, which [he has promised to do](https://joebiden.com/two-tax-policies/)**. These corporate taxes would heavily affect tech companies.\n\n\n  \nTo explain, the institutional whales (the folks who actually move markets) believe that:\n\n- Companies that benefitted bigly from Trump's tax cuts (tech companies especially) will be hurt by Biden raising taxes.\n* Companies that would benefit from fiscal stimulus (green new deal, infrastructure) will be helped by Biden's plans, and even more if Biden controls Congress.  \n* Regardless of who controls the Senate, the divided nature means some companies are guaranteed to benefit.\n\n\n\nDon't take my word for it. Read this report from Goldman Sachs (p.15-16): https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/beyond-2020-post-election-policies-f/report.pdf  \n\n\n\nOriginally, tech companies (facing more regulation and tax increases under the Democratic Trifecta) were trending down. But when it seemed that the Republicans would hold the Senate with a 51 seat-majority, tech stocks made a sharp U-turn\n\nYet, there was a small blip downward the very next week. This was not a circumstantial correction. It happened because David Perdue (R) in Georgia fell below the threshold to prevent a Jan. 5 runoff, leaving the Republican majority at 50, and injecting the slim possibility for the Democrats to still fully control Congress.  \n\nNow let's jump to the week ahead:\n\n**Right now, Democrats control 48 seats in the U.S. Senate. If they can win both Georgia Senate runoffs on Jan. 5, they will have 50 seats.** With Vice-President Harris as the tie-breaker, they would be able to pass Democratic legislation like tax increases. **In other words, the outcome of this election would have a huge impact on certain stocks.**\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Which stocks are impacted, and why**\n\nIf Democrats gain control of the U.S. Senate, that means Biden can pass his legislation.\n\n* Some companies will be helped bigly (e.g. Renewables)\n* Some companies may be hurt (more taxes) but also helped (more fiscal spending)\n* Some companies may be hurt bigly (more taxes, regs, and less gov't subsidies)\n\nTo make this a pure election-related play, we want to trade:\n\n* companies that benefit bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)\n* companies that are hurt bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)\n\nSo what companies benefitted the most from Trump's tax cuts? (Source: Goldman Sachs Client note)  \n\n* Tech companies like Netflix, which saw its effective tax rate go from 23% to 7%.\n* Railroad companies like CSX, which saw its effective tax rate go from 37% to 23%.\n* Healthcare companies like HCA, which saw its effective tax rate go from 32% to 20%.\n* Pure financial companies like CME, saw their effective tax rate go from 36% to 23%.\n\nObviously, pandemic-related questions muddle price-action on healthcare. At the same time, there is still some policy uncertainty to what will happen to railroads regardless of the outcome of the runoffs (they will have higher taxes, but that may be offset by stimulus/infrastructure spending). That leaves two sectors as our pure election plays:\n\n* Tech companies will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate\n* Financials will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate\n\nOut of those sectors, specific companies may be overvalued or undervalued, and other concerns may matter more than legislative impact by the U.S Congress. For example, BABA is a tech company in QQQ, but as a Chinese company it sure isn't going to impacted much by U.S. tax legislation. We can just ignore it.\n\nHowever, a U.S. company like NFLX which is a bit overpriced and very exposed to a tax-cut rollback, is an excellent bear trade for a Democratic Senate scenario (especially if corporate tax increases start being mentioned). While MSFT, which is slightly under-valued and also exposed to tax increases, may be a good trade against a Democratic Senate.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n  \n**Information about the races to consider:**\n\n* In the November General election:\n\t* Perdue (R) won **49.7 percent** of the vote, while Ossoff (D) won **47.9 percent**. In other words, Ossoff substantially underperformed Biden.\n\t* The Republican candidates (Loeffler + Collins) won a combined **49.4 percent**, while the Democratic candidates (Warnock et al) won a combined **48.4 percent**.\n\t* **These are both substantial leads for the incumbent Republican Senators.**\n* What the \"reputable\" polls say about Jan. 5:\n\t* Republican-leaning **Trafalgar Group** (\"most accurate pollster of 2016\"), which had Trump up 3-4% in its November poll, has now pegged **both the Democratic candidates leading slightly in its late December poll.**\n\t* Democratic-leaning Survey-USA (which has pretty accurate polling) had Biden up 1-2% in its last general election poll, is now predicting **a Democratic sweep** of both Senate seats\n\t* Poll to Watch: AJC/UGA, with polling by UGA Professor Trey Hood (the most accurate major poll for Georgia this year). **This will be released soon.**\n* Trump has been calling the runoff \"invalid\", which might mean some of his supporters could boycott the election.\n* The Rev. Raphael Warnock is currently in divorce proceedings, and was recently accused by his wife of running over her foot with his car. Watch for whether this gains any traction (or at least enough to sway swing voters)\n\n\n**The plays:**\n\n- If you expect **both Democratic Senate candidates to sweep** (both 2%+), then AGGRESSIVELY short QQQ, NFLX, CME, and long green energy + industrials (e.g. etfs like TAN and Solar stocks like ENPH). I would buy weekly Jan. 8 FD puts.\n* If you expect **both Democratic Senate candidates to win** (both 0.5%+), short QQQ, NFLX, CME. I would buy puts for Jan. 15/22, since the counting might drag on a few days.\n* If you expect **Republicans to comfortably hold at least one seat**, long QQQ (specifically NFLX, FB, and MSFT) for Jan. 15\n* If you expect **Republicans to sweep**, long QQQ and short green energy for Jan. 15.\n* If you expect it to be **nail-bitingly close**, and unclear whether Republicans can hold at least one seat (think month-long recount), long vega on QQQ &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; NFLX with a bearish tilt. This would be buying OTM puts, or buying a medium-term strangle. \n* If you expect Trump to still be President on Jan 22 following the events of Jan. 6, aggressively short SPY and long MAGA because a civil war is probably coming.\n\n\n\n**FAQ:**\n\n**Q: What is the expected outcome?**  \nA: Republicans win, but there is enough uncertainty that you can definitely make money.\n\n**Q: Why bother trading an election?**  \nA: This is largely a binary event. A candidate either wins or they don't. This beats trading earnings, as often we could get the earnings result right, but still get cucked by guidance. Moreover, as shown by what has been happening in recent years, the market is often no longer sure of the outcome.", "author_fullname": "t2_ekh9v", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Dummy's guide to trading the Georgia Senate Runoff", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kouetj", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 46, "total_awards_received": 2, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 46, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1609588094.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609607199.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>TLDR: There is a Senate runoff in Georgia on Jan. 5 that will determine which political party controls the Senate.<br/>\nIf you are pretty sure about what the trajectory of the Georgia Senate Runoffs will be, you can make money.
