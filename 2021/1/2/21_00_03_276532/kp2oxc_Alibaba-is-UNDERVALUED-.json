{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "One after another negative catalysts have been annihilating Alibaba\u2019s share price. First it was the [ANT IPO fiasco](https://imgur.com/kDpBPlg) and then it was CCP regulatory concerns. Do you really think the CCP is on a warpath to meaningfully hinder one of their most profitable companies? If so then stop reading here. This is literally a gift from the CCP and here is why.\n\nFirst lets start off with some fundamental boomer valuation metrics. According to Nasdaq.com here\u2019s a comparison of the two largest e-commerce companies.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nALIBABA Forward P/E:\n\n2021: 30\n\n2022: 23\n\n2023: 17\n\n12 month Forward PEG ratio: 1.46\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAMAZON Forward P/E:\n\n2021: 73\n\n2022: 52\n\n2023:(no estimates)\n\n12 month Forward PEG ratio: 3.22\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nAs you can see Alibaba is CRITICALLY undervalued compared to Amazon. When PEG is taken into account with P/E it can justify a currently high P/E IF AND ONLY IF said company is expected to grow earnings fast enough YOY. According to Zack\u2019s the E-commerce industry as a whole has a PEG ratio of about 2.56 which would indicate that Alibaba is undervalued in comparison to not only Amazon but most if not all of its peers as well. Lets also not forget that Alibaba recently increased their [share buyback program from 6 billion to 10 bilion](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/alibaba-raises-stock-buyback-plan-to-10-billion-but-stock-continues-to-sink-11609124627). That's an increase of over 66%.... Even Alibaba themselves thinks their shares are undervalued and wants to take advantage of the recent sell off.\n\nSecondly lets check out the technical side of things. Here is a [weekly chart](https://imgur.com/5ffIMmO) that shows a very attractive uptrending pattern for the last few years. It also shows that Alibaba was overextended and needed a healthy pullback. Now it's oversold and in prime territory for a true dip buy opportunity. An opportunity this large has presented itself just 4 times in a little over 2 years. The huge green candle tells me that after the sell off Alibaba bulls were lying in wait for a moment like this to scoop up more shares.\n\nLastly  lets break it down in WSB valuation metrics. Daniel Zhang YOLOd his way into an empire and his wife\u2019s boyfriend(The CCP) has noticed that he is incredibly profitable and doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. The wife's boyfriend is starting to fear for his top position in the house. This is why the wife's boyfriend wants to regulate the little autist so that he can maintain power over both his wife and the autist. That said the wife's boyfriend doesn't want to kick the autist out. He still wants to keep the little autist around because he generates money for him while he hangs out with his wife.\n\nTLDR; The CCP wants to make sure it stays in position as the wife's boyfriend.
