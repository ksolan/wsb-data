{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I've been noticing some GME bears coming out of the woods so here's a DD up your butthole, don't worry, I'll use lube and I'll ease into it slowly.\n\n\"GME GONNA BE BANKRUPT HUUR DURR\" - GME bears\n\nIf GME was going bankrupt, it would've done so already during the lockdown, not in the beginning of a console cycle. Here's a brief look at the credit markets backdrop and I'll explain why GME won't go bankrupt anytime soon and is in fact very bullish for GME.\n\nI'm not gonna go into how GME improved their balance sheets and got FCF, lots of people did that already, but I'll say something in WSB terms. Printers go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR yo. When the IG and HYG credit market went to shit back in March and April, JPOW pulled out his magnificent printers and set it to BRR mode, the end result is well functioning credit markets with spreads that are tight af. With yields in treasuries and IG being low, people are forced to look for yield in junk bonds. This is why you hear about how CCL was able to raise debt without using ships as collateral and airlines using their flyer points as collateral to raise debt. Creditors are willing to lend at laughable rates  just to get yield. Now GME doesn't need to raise more debt, it is meeting it obligations early but if it ever needs to raise capital for future growth operations, they can easily raise capital in the credit market for as long as JPOW sets the printer in BRR mode. Which we know won't change until at least 2023, I honestly think it'll be longer than that  but it doesn't matter anyways since wsb doesn't even look 6 months out ahead. Notice how we haven't had as much bankruptcies as people thought we would ?(small businesses don't count) Well that's because of our great lord and savior, JPOW\n\nSo there you have it, betting on GME bankruptcy is essentially betting against JPOW losing control of the credit market. **JPOW is in effect GME gang's daddy #1**. (iloveyoujpow) \n\n\"BUT GME HAD NEGATIVE EPS FOR SO MANY YEARS!\" - more gay GME bears\n\nYou see the problem with bears is that they are always backwards looking, no vision for the future, no hopes for anything, always depressing. For some reason they can't understand that a lot of the market participants are writing off 2020 because of the pandemic, they also can't understand GME is cyclical and moves along with the console cycle, meaning we are now in the early days of a gme pump. Their inability to look forward is in fact the number 1 reason why their wives have chad forward looking boyfriends. **Our forward looking chad is of course Ryan Cohen (Daddy #2)**, I don't even need to explain more, but GME GANG daddy #2 obviously has a vision and he is more than ready to double down on his bet, buying GME at $16 just two weeks ago. He had a few mysterious tweets recently and people are speculating that he is ready to make another move. I'm not going to join the speculation  but the fact that he bought at $16 means that is probably the floor price and I would go all in with calls if it ever dips below that.  \n\n\"THEY HAVE NO VIABLE BUSINESS MODEL IN THE AGE OF ECOMMERCE\" - Gay bear and Melvin capital\n\nWe have to give credit where it's due, Melvin capital likely had significant alpha with their investment thesis. If you look at their holdings, you'll see that they are long ecommerce and short specialty retail. They saw the demise of various brick and mortar stores back around 2015 and executed on that thesis. I'd argue that the covid pandemic essentially pulled forward all the earnings growth and priced in a lot of that growth with high PE multiples. The problem with that thesis is that it is now old, ecommerce is a crowded trade and this will not be an alpha generating thesis.  The best way to generate alpha is now to invest in a new counter thesis that can outperform the crowded ecommerce thesis. \n\nOmnichannel is one of such counter thesis, it's starting to get hyped everywhere. This is why Sherman repeats that word like he's autistic, this guy probably mutters it while banging his wife but judging by his conference call, she's probably never been excited by him. Likely he doesn't know how to execute on that thesis, thank god for GME GANG DADDY RC. \n\nThat's not to say he is useless, despite all the shit we gave him. Sherman managed to close down unprofitable stores, reduced inventory and got cashflow positive during a pandemic. This is textbook shit but still very important. and despite the letters RC put out, he could be very receptive of his ideas for all we know. He has shown to be somewhat shareholder friendly through previous buybacks and he did not rule out further share buybacks. Sherman himself holds over 1million shares and has not yet sold them as far as I know. The shelf offering concerns seems to have faded for now, and it will become smaller as the stock price increases. I really just think GME management wants to use that to capitalize on any potential pumps in the stock. This will probably be re-invested anyways.\n\nSo what did GME do so far to improve its business model? So far I've seen the following\n\n1. Pivot to ecommerce and improving ecommerce sales - which has seen decent growth\n2. Diversifying sales to include more high margin items like PC accessories, PC monitors, etc ( If I speculate, there may be partnerships with certain brands\n3. Focusing on loyalty programs like power ups - I'll never understand loyalty programs but some people are retardedly loyal to stores that offer rewards. If they can offer good incentives they can achieve high conversion rates , as far as I know, GameStop is the only specialty video game retailer in north America that offers such reward programs.\n4. Store rebranding - this might be good for their goodwill, which got hammered over the years\n\nDaddy RC has more plans for GME and we can only speculate what they might be right now, but with 12% stake, he has what he needs to go full on activist on the BoD. I expect to see some departures and replacements in the reasonably near future. \n\nIf that's not enough for you, here's a few more possible catalysts for the stock that I don't see a lot of people mentioning \n\n1. A possible new Nintendo console release in \\~1-2 years \n2. Currently distressed commercial REITs = ability to negotiate lower rent = more $$$\n3. Likely return of inflation (debatable but money supply ballooned and we are seeing velocity pick up a bit) with JPOW promising to keep rates at 0% even when inflation comes back = bullish for all stocks, bears will get slaughtered\n4. OG printer Yellen manning the treasury in a month + possible dem senate = more stimmy checks = more money going into GME\n5. If sales improve and balance sheets continue improve, we might see more credit upgrades \n6. Better sales = possible dividend re-instatement , I couldn't care less about dividends but guess who's going to be paying? The shorts lol.  If Sherman had balls, he would pull an OSTK and announce a special dividend , which will actually lead to a short squeeze while wsb laughs collectively as  we get meme returns from this boomer move. \n\nI'm sure the OG GME bulls can think of more reasons, I've been in and out of GME since it was at $9 (my CC's kept on getting assigned).\n\nCurrent positions\n\n500x GME shares - ready to buy more at the dip Monday and Tuesday, going to sell a few puts\n\n15x Apr $20c Leaps\n\n10x  Jan 15 $20c YOLOs\n\nSo does this mean I think GME will squeeze to $69 by next friday? No. GME short interest has been high for years, Melvin capital isn't going to be that worried since their GME position is likely hedged and not a big part of their holdings (they're probably laughing at wsb for all the memes we put out). We will likely have a few more dips next week which I will buy. Depending on how much WSB pumps GME before ICR or console sale release (which I expect to be lackluster due to shortages), I'll either take profit or sell some ITM calls if IV's are high. Then buy the dip.\n\nTLDR:   \nGME bankruptcy is out of the question for the next 3-5 years because of the macro and credit market, RC is putting a floor of $16 on the price (debatable but you're welcome to buy puts or short below $16). bears need to stop looking backwards and be anticipatory. GME short squeeze likely not going to happen overnight but a bit slowly as more people realize GME isn't going bankrupt and either buy in or cover their short positions.", "author_fullname": "t2_87buwj2p", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "GME DD from a retard bull - The credit market, why GME gang has two daddies, omnichannel and more", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_kp7t9u", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609656919.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been noticing some GME bears coming out of the woods so here&#39;s a DD up your butthole, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll use lube and I&#39;ll ease into it slowly.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;GME GONNA BE BANKRUPT HUUR DURR&quot; - GME bears</p>\n\n<p>If GME was going bankrupt, it would&#39;ve done so already during the lockdown, not in the beginning of a console cycle.
