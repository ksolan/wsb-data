That shitron play was literally the raid boss round 1, if we can bring the price back up from that fall then the future is already foretold. They cant possibly having anything stronger than the biggest shorting name in the business, known for massive price manipulations using their \"research\".

I have this year exploited a massive value gap in RPS Group in the UK, buying in around 30p (now 80p), a cheeky 250% in 9 months.  GME Position 292 shares @$17\n\nNow,\n\nI want dig dip below the surface of your little smoothbrains and tap into that imagination. Here I will take you through some examples and imagine the future GME. Lets be Aunt Cathie ,like how she imagines branch future outcomes based on existing states. Ie Tesla has good full self driving software way ahead of competitors, therefore it can be the first mover in the autonomous taxi network. At the end of the day our only limit is Lord Cohens imagination.\n\nI want you to consider the whole world of gaming. PC, console, handheld, peripherals and chairs, board games, VR experiences, merch, performance enhancement, esports. I\u2019m sure there are others I haven\u2019t thought of. The name is GAMESTOP, its strong and well known, and is well distributed in the hearts of cities and towns. Its time people stop thinking about its as just a place that will only sell discs like a record store. As an ecommerce opportunity GME can be one stop store for all of these. As far as I understand there is not one decent site that offers all of this under one roof, I have an example in another industry later. Amazon do all this retard.. but who honestly enjoys shopping at Amazon, literally its only good for fast free delivery. Its full of shitty Chinese knockoffs, searching is awful, doesn\u2019t have half the stuff you want, full of fake reviews, and jeff is a wanker and amazon treat their workers like shit. There is a gap in the market for a all-in-one game store with fast free delivery that treats its customers like saints. Any physical stores should reflect this and be like nerd nirvana. Latest cool products, meet ups, board game events, esports tourneys, repairs - community hub for nerds spreading the sweet brand of GME. \n\nThis year I have spent over 1k on gaming stuff, headset, new pc, chair, ps5 to come rip stock. This was a fucking mission having to go all over the internet to find good value and the bits I wanted with all the items ending up arriving at different times. New PC from like 5 different places, Scan, amazon, ebay, Box. Headset from Scan, Chair direct from Secret Lab, monitor from fuck knows where. Would have been so much easier if I good buy it all from one place and get a bulk discount for buying so much shit. \n\nAll these products bring me on to esports which ties into the game industry story. Esports is literally being eaten up by venture capitalists and smart brands. Guess who sponsors ESL, yes fucking Mercedes Benz & DHL, not who you think would advertise (#GrowUp, lel) to supposably greasy fat pale skinned skint young esport neckbeards. What boomers don\u2019t seem to get is that \u201cgamers\u201d aren\u2019t like this, and that they are the incoming middle class, who will create families whose children will be brought up with brands their parents are exposed to. They have well paid jobs like software engineers, doctors, teachers, engineers. This is literally WSB and is why boomers aren\u2019t getting us and GME. I mean look at our god, DFV, he\u2019s quirky but a normal guy and plenty of cash. Both of these companies have not only got PR gold as infamous memes ([We did it reddit! Mercedes embraced the meme : DotA2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/79hb3t/we_did_it_reddit_mercedes_embraced_the_meme/)) have spread, and DHL chants in stadiums have been sung, but are gaining love for sponsoring events people are really passionate about. Gamers love things that support their passion and are very brand loyal and are the right age (18-32) to sow deep brand loyalty. Now imagine GME starts getting involved in these events, sowing its brand in the same way as Mercedes to the same people that will then guaranteed buy stuff at its store. Its literally unbelievable this synergy hasn\u2019t been exploited yet. I would love to see someone address all this stuff that actually knows advertising and marketing well compared to me just reading things over the years.\n\nNext I want to give you an example of some all in one stores that already outcompete Amazon in a certain similar industry. For this I will use bicycles, yes you did hear me right. As some of you will no doubt know the world of bicycles has so much symmetry with gaming. Bicycles owners love having the latest tech and coolest toys, they love upgrading and are super passionate and proud about their hobby and are within an ecosystem both tech wise and like esports e.g Copying the gear of pro cyclists like esports watchers do of pro gamers, watching big youtube channels with further advertised products \u2013 this is all gamers in a nutshell. Again I use myself as an example, I use a Sennheiser headset, SteelSeries peripherals. Funnily I have bought these subconsciously via the sponsored products used by the team EG.  Amazon and other mega stores whilst selling some stuff just don\u2019t compete with the specialised all in one ecommerce stores like Wiggle/Chain Reaction Cycles & Sigma Sports. 95% of the bike stuff I have ever bought is from these. They sell everything to do with bikes, clothing (merch), health and nutrition, components, upgrades, the list goes on. Sound familiar? The products and ecosystem are just too technical and complex for some mega store like Amazon to do it properly. Likewise Amazon cannot focus on customer experience like these stores can, which is important for technical products if there is a tech issue or a breakdown- Amazon is too big and spread out for its own good. If you mention Wiggle to someone,\u201d oh yeah that\u2019s the place that sends out Haribo with every order\u201d. Basically, GME needs to integrate itself amongst the wider gaming world and community with strategic partnerships, marketing, and combine this with excellent customer service. I\u2019m sure big daddy Cohen as already cottoned on to this.\n\nLastly I want to bring your attention to Games Workshop in the UK, its worth checking this out as to how GME may improve itself. Its literally the darling of the London Stock Exchange \u201cThe company is the best performing FTSE250 retailer of the past decade\u201d.  More importantly it shows how well a business with significant strategic brick and mortar, and ecommerce presence can perform.\n\nWe should note lastly that although we don't have any proof any of this will occur, sometimes you have to believe in the vision laid out by a man to extract ultimate value out of of a play. Cohen is our Elon in this play. \n\nHopefully this has opened your imagination to some extra pathways in the GME value thesis. Yours sincerely, a tea drinker.
