{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**TLDR: Blackberry shot up massively today on a gamma squeeze, with market makers/dealers having to buy shit tons of shares (maybe 70 or 80m) to hedge all the options they sold you guys. That ramp is now used and is a bit of a liability, but not if you have diamond hands as a group. Movement up from here will require the stock attracts more money, but you get an EZ mode boost again from $14.5-$16.25 or so.**\n\nAs you all know, there was a GME gamma squeeze last week (you guys say short squeeze, but I believe dealers bought 30m or more shares tues/wed/thursday to hedge all the options they sold you guys). Historic in scale I think, one of the largest ever to hit a small cap stock.  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nCompletely not to my surprise, BB has exactly the same thing going on, with insane open interest, and you guys appear to have done it again today with BB, so that's two historic gamma squeezes over two weeks. I wonder which stock is next?  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nI went and examined BB, in which I have absolutely no position and haven't the faintest clue what is up with it other than it's some sort of fruit \ud83c\udf47 and space exploration company\ud83d\ude80 that also makes star trek style tricorders [\ud83d\udcf2](https://emojipedia.org/mobile-phone-with-rightwards-arrow-at-left/), which all sounds pretty cool actually, so I should probably be long.\n\nBB has a float or 508m shares. Here's the current gamma chart of the stock:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/jyySqX9](https://imgur.com/a/jyySqX9)\n\nFor those of you who haven't been paying attention, or are unable to form new memories for medical or genetic reasons, gamma squeeze is when the price moves quickly over various option strikes, causing dealers to buy a ton of stock (if price up) or sell a ton of stock (if price down) so as to not be underwater on the options they sold you guys. In other words, a stock with a TON of options bought by WSB will tend to move a lot faster in price around those option strikes.\n\nLooking at this gamma chart, and those are in hundred thousand contracts btw, you can see why today went crazy. Today, BB, in going from $10.15 a share or wahtever to 12.51 a share, forced dealers to buy about 70 or 80m shares.... on a 508m float... which means they were 2/3 of the trading today. Not really surprising to buy 20% of the float on dealer action (plus whatever you guys were buying) and see a 25% move up. I'm a little surprised it wasn't more tbh, so there are probably some covered calls held by dealers in there, and those people are hating life right now.\n\nThe problem is though that you guys hit the end of the gamma ramp. That's why the stock slowed down after 12.5 - you can see it in the gamma chart. No gamma lift means no more forced dealer buying. The good news is there is another gamma ramp at 15, so if you get it up to like 14.5, it'll ramp real easily to maybe 16 16.25 I think, but after that, no ramp.\n\nIn terms of short-term trading dynamics, there are some options expiring this week - about 35 thousand contracts of calls. These will cause a VERY slight melt-up (maybe half a percent tops) as the week goes on, then when dumped or monetized Friday, will cause selling of 3.5m shares of selling, which isn't really a huge deal, and should have marginal effects on price, like half a percent at most down. Most of this open interest is much longer dated, mostly out a year or more.\n\nWhy does all of this matter? well:\n\n1. It's going to be harder for the price to go up from here without new gamma established, or a lot more buying. Dealers did heavy lifting for you today with that 70 or 80 million share purchase (would have been more if shorted dated, but it wasn't). That's not happening again until 15, and at 15, it's still only maybe 25m shares in reality, not 70 or 80m, so you'd expect a smaller acceleration there.\n2. If people monetize their calls, it's going to hurt, as dealers dump to de-hedge, and there's a gamma ramp down as you can see.\n3. And of course, the stock is vulnerable to a push down since you have a massive gamma ramp below the price, and no gamma ramp above.\n4. But, those calls are super long duration, so I would not be freaking out. I just think there's resistance up from here, which was seen in today's price action - no gamma ramp.\n\nI have no idea where it goes from here. I have no idea if BB is undervalued. And I always disclose my positions, and have no position in BB. But, it's not at a stable price right here - resistance up until 14.5 or so, and a fast, greased up slide down if selling happens. If you can get to 14.5 though, it's an express train to 16.25 or so.\n\nConsequently, if anyone wants gamma write-ups on other stocks that are trending around here, let me know.", "author_fullname": "t2_2ksvu6ky", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "BB Gamma Conditions", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_l11lcs", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 82, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 82, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1611117217.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1611145388.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>TLDR: Blackberry shot up massively today on a gamma squeeze, with market makers/dealers having to buy shit tons of shares (maybe 70 or 80m) to hedge all the options they sold you guys.
