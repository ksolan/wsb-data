It\u2019s unfortunately a long read and for most of you that attended the The Derek Zoolander Center for Kids Who Can't Read Good and Who Wanna Learn to Do Other Stuff Good Too, I wish you the best of luck (assuming you failed out).\n\n[Legacy of WSB: GME Short Squeeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzftk2/legacy_of_wsb_gme_short_squeeze/)\n\nUnfortunately for Jim Cramer (\u201cJimbo\u201d), I didn\u2019t bring him up in previous post because I admire him or watch his show. It\u2019s because the man himself is going to help describe what happened today with GME. Cue up the video or a read the transcript below. I honestly find Jimbo annoying as fuck and I don\u2019t want to force and of you actually listen or look at him.\n\n[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI)\n\n[Transcript](https://slate.com/culture/2007/03/will-cramer-s-crazy-confession-destroy-his-career.html)\n\nBefore I actually get into some of Jimbo\u2019s self admitted tricks of the trade and how they are being applied to GME, I need tell you a quick story about a lovely little real estate holding company called Global Links (traded over the counter) and an investor by the name of Robert Simpson. Simpson\u2019s win was so big, he was interviewed on Bloomberg News on 14Mar2007 along with the CEO of Overstock.com (remember that company from my last post that hit 669 days on the Threshold Security List?). Well Simpson\u2019s big trade was spending $5,000 to acquire 100% of the company (he actually acquired 111% or 1,282,050 shares), the really cool part of this trade was that despite owning over 100% of the company the trading volume over the next 2 days was 50 million shares.\n\n[Transcript: Phantom Shares,' Failed Trades and Naked Shorts](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-145.htm)\n\nThe only other quick primer you folks need to digest the below is a quick understanding of market manipulation. As per the ever so useless folks at the SEC (directly from their website), market manipulation is when someone artificially affects the supply or demand for a security (for example, causing stock prices to rise or to fall dramatically).\n\nMarket manipulation may involve techniques including:\n\n\u00b7 Spreading false or misleading information about a company;\n\n\u00b7 Engaging in a series of transactions to make a security appear more actively traded; and\n\n\u00b7 Rigging quotes, prices, or trades to make it look like there is more or less demand for a security than is the case.\n\n**Market Manipulation**\n\nAgain, a big thanks to the Eight Pound, Six Ounce, Newborn Baby Jimbo, don't even know a word yet (reference to Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby because it pains me to think of that bald 65-year asshole). Let\u2019s review the Institutional short\u2019s toolkit and then figure out what is going on with our beloved Gamestop.\n\n**1. Flooding the offer side of the board**: Any of you folks with level 2 data seen those fun price walls?\n\n**2. Short Down Ladder**: Short A will open a new short position and sell a share at $40 and short B will buy that share to cover an existing position and the open a new short at $39 and so on.\n\n**3.
