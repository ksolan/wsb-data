Now a bit on this autist. In short, Andrew\u2019s a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b, in long he\u2019s a self proclaimed \u201c*activist short seller*\u201d. He was married to Ms. Andrea Left, *her username checked out*. His internet newsletter has been running for 17 years now, and apparently has 50 cases in the company\u2019s favor since 2001, do the math and you find out that he can fuckin time travel. Now, there\u2019s a lot of stock commentary websites, newsletters, tv shows and podcasts. Why has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy?  \n\nWhy has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy? Well, dear autists, the self proclaimed \u201c*activist*\u201d we\u2019re talking about here, who sees himself as a messiah against corporate fraud and market manipulation is reported by NYTimes as follows : \u201cHe can make a killing in a bear market while everyone else on Wall Street suffers.\u201d His methods of investment are rather questionable and has come under much of the financial world\u2019s scrutiny.\n\nNow, fellow autists, this part is very important. **This is his strategy**. Reported by NYTimes once again \u201cAfter he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the company\u2019s value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries.\u201d Keep in mind we are talking about a man that shorted Tesla stock in 2018 and got mad when it didn\u2019t go his way. So mad that he sued Tesla and Papa Elon for stock manipulation. [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/short-seller-andrew-left-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-tesla-and-elon-musk.html). \n\nSERIOUSLY, THIS DUDE FUCKING SHORTED TESLA AT **$177**, ITS AT **$844.20** TODAY. If this wasn\u2019t enough wait to hear the companies in his \u201c*ambitious track record*\u201d. \n\nSince all of you lack basic correlation skills to connect the dots, let me do it for you fucking losers. What is he doing with GME. Are we not seeing the same pattern here? He is publicly short on GME and is tweeting it. He is known for this kind of manipulation. When he noticed the price had crossed the $43 wall he made it public that he is short GME. He could\u2019ve scheduled the meeting immediately, but no. He scheduled it a day later, now this is perfect for the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b because, he is literally buying time. Buying time when alot of GME holders are in with their life savings on r/wsb. **24 HOURS IS ENOUGH TIME TO SOW THE SEEDS OF DOUBT AND CAUSE PARANOIA TO PEOPLE WITH THEIR LIFE ON LINE.

Is the time.\n\n**SCANDAL #1**. Here\u2019s a notable event on this aucstivist. In 2016, this \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b was banned from the Hong Kong stock market for 5 years over a 2012 report on the firm China Evergrande Group as a result of releasing a report containing \u201cfalse and/or misleading claims\u201d about the above-mentioned company. Forced to pay a little over $720,000 as fines on the profits and legal expenses. He\u2019s on his last string in HK, after his warning, he could end up in jail for violating once again.

This guy is what he swore to destroy at this point wait till you read this. Jumia Technologies ($JMIA : NYSE) is an online e-commerce platform founded out of Nigeria in 2012. They gained a fair amount of traction and went public in Apr 2019. It was received very well and rose from around $25 at opening to $41 within a matter of a few weeks. Everything was well until Shitron Research adopted a short position and saw nothing of its potentials. The report came in accusing Jumia of fraud, torpedo\u2019ing the company downwards. It dropped till approx. $2.80. BUT GUESS WHAT, SURPRISE! SHITRON AND ANDICKREW \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b said they\u2019re LONG ON THE STOCK. AND THERE\u2019S **NO WAY** THEY\u2019RE SHORTING AGAIN. This man capitalized on the drop of an e-commerce startup out of Nigeria and is now currently benefitting from the uprise. $JMIA sits at $45.56 as of now.

Now i\u2019m pretty sure if you\u2019ve been active on the sub you\u2019ve seen the COLOSSAL failures this company has made. I\u2019ll attach it right here. [JUST GO AND SEE THIS ITS IMPORTANT TO GET A PROPER VIEW](https://imgur.com/a/QvKVC9V).\n\nApart from this, another IMPORTANT info would be that, the live stream where he claimed he is going to expose the top 5 reasons why he\u2019s GME short right now, would PROBABLY be live on his **TWITTER** (@CitronResearch). Hope to see everyone there and I CANNOT WAIT TO PROVE this self proclaimed ~~activist~~ WRONG.\n\nNOW RETARDS KEEP READING BECAUSE, this is not possible without everyone holding tight and buying more \ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e. We will be hit badly again, the boomer investors cannot take Citron\u2019s cock out of their mouths, so we expect a sell off, DO NOT GIVE THE BEARS A CHANCE TO BUY. Today could even be a red day, **BUT FEAR NOT**. We will hopefully emerge victorious.
