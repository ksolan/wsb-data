{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Looking at today\u2019s trading day, was going to be what I think was the real test to see how much longer a squeeze could take. I don\u2019t know the exact timing but here are some observations that I observe. \n\nThe SEC rule 201 was lifted today. Which means the shorts had an opportunity to drive the price down as much as they could. There wasn\u2019t a significant drive down as of today by 2:52pm. This makes me believe one of two thing:\n\n1) Yesterday\u2019s reports that there are no more shares to short are true. Which makes be believe that the shorts also took a long position at some point to hedge against to much upward loss. Which, if you have that kind of money in play is both smart to do and feasible. So now, they are burning through those shares to make us run out of steam and give up. I think this because if you look at volume spikes today, the stock goes up at significant increased volume spike and then slowly goes down from there. It looks like they are trying to match the buys and sells so the stock price stagnant. I don\u2019t know how much stocks they have long to be able to do this but around half of the days volume has to be a sell if the price is somewhat flat. That\u2019s a significant amount of shares if that\u2019s the case. So who actually knows how much inventory they have less. My assumption is not many. In this scenario, it\u2019s just a matter of time until they run out of steam if stocks continue to be purchased or people hold the shares. \n\n2) They still have available shares to short and we just don\u2019t know it. Even though we have the reports that there aren\u2019t any, there\u2019s a chance that they are wrong. Because today is flat, means they didn\u2019t use all the short shares available. This makes me think that they are going to try to get the price to go down tomorrow as a coordinated attempt during or after the Shitron live Twitter event. What they will try and do is spook the retail investors who don\u2019t have the guts for volatility to sell at the same time, then they use the rest of the available short shares, and maybe sell the rest of their long shares ALL at the SAME TIME. That will spook other people and then a mass sale happens driving the price of the stock down. To me this could be a very real threat. Not sure what to do in this scenario, but I\u2019m sure somebody who is much, much more experienced than me knows how to navigate (please please please comment below). I would assume that the longs need to know not to sell no matter what happens and rally one last time and buy up the rest of the shares. Hopefully, management knows this threat and also has a plan of their own.\n\nFurther thought of the situation, I think the shorts were forced to come up with some kind of PR that\u2019s going to scare people. If they didn\u2019t do that and then colluded together without that event, it would be deliberate market manipulation. But if they can piggyback on retail selling out, they can get away with pulling an all out attack. \n\nLuckily, for retail, they did give us a heads up of an event which gives retail the time to come up with its own plan on how to defend. \n\nRetail can do what everybody has been saying, don\u2019t sell. Also, as shareholders and now there is a lot of you, you can suggest that GameStop corporate come up with a strategy as well or ask them to release some more info on their plans for the future and such. GameStop already has a bunch of press right now and some sorta news can be really good to combat what could happen tomorrow. As a public company they have to have its investors in its best interest. Since a short seller is not technically an investor yet (they haven\u2019t physically bought shares like all of us) we might be able to nudge corporate in the right direction. Maybe send an email or give GameStop corporate a call and ask nicely for some news tomorrow. \n\nGame stop investor relations phone number: 817-424-2001.\n\nGameStop investor relations email address: investorrelations@gamestop.com\n\nThat info was found directly on their website.\n\nRemember ASK NICELY. Retail may be Autists but we are good people. We are currently saving a company from bankruptcy. If you own 1 share or 10million shares of GameStop stock.
