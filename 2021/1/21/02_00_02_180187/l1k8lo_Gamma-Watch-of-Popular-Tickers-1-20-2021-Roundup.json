{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Due to the growing size of the sub, we've been causing more gamma squeeze events on stocks - GME last week, BB Monday.\n\nGamma is an option term. What it means in this context is the amount of stock someone short the options would need to buy or sell to hedge their position as price moves.\n\nFor WSB popular stocks, I believe that about 2/3 - 3/4 of all options were sold by dealers to you degenerates, which means that the dealer is now \"short gamma\", which is not a superhero movie involving dwarves.\n\nThat means that as prices move, dealers have to madly buy or sell stocks in the direction of the price movement so as not to lose money, because option dealers/market makers ALWAYS win (almost). This means that in some situations, moving over a \"gamma ramp\" (price where there's a lot of gamma) may be many times easier than in areas without a lot of gamma. This in turn makes a \"gamma squeeze\" where dealers are forced to buy or sell stock so as to not lose money (similar to short squeeze, which is when shorts are forced to buy, causing yet more buying, so as to not lose more money).\n\nIn most cases, gamma is not a meaningful effect on a stock, close to zero. But it can be a big deal. In BB's case, I think as much as 2/3 of the stock bought on Monday was dealers, and the weak rally today is evidence of that - no gamma ramp. GME is similar - passed a huge gamma ramp to get to the 30s last week (with dealers doing 2/3 of the buying), now kind of in between several gamma ramps, with dead zones 36-38 and 31-34.\n\nLooking at gamma can help you guys understand what price actions are possible. It's a giant lever that can go against you or for you. If price is slightly above a gamma ramp, it's bearish because small amounts of selling can crash the price quickly. If the price is slightly below a gamma ramp, it's bullish, because small buying can cause the price to run up the ramp, while your downside is insulated by little forced selling by the dealers.\n\nNote that when you buy NEW options from dealers, they just do the trade you do initially - buy a put, they sell stock. Buy a call, they buy stock. But from there, price moves cause them to match the stock price movement - they remove some of their short when price goes up and they sold you a put, and they enlarge their long when the price goes up and they sold you a call. Make sense? Thought not, work on your reading comprehension guys if you are trading complex derivatives with your life savings.\n\nKeep in mind that in a lot of cases, there's no meaningful gamma, and no price action will occur.\n\nI prepared today gamma outlooks on some of the most mentioned stocks - GME, BB, PLTR, ICLN,TSLA TLRY, NIO. Note that this tool ([http://www.tradingvolatility.net/](http://www.tradingvolatility.net/)) assumes that calls are long gamma for dealers, and puts are short gamma. I think when you guys engage a stock, it's more like 3/4 of all gamma is short gamma, put or call.  Thetagang shows up and gives them some long gamma.\n\nCurrent popular stock gamma landscapes (IMGUR has been a bit wonky lately... hopefully its loading):\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/1IrWNln](https://imgur.com/a/1IrWNln)\n\nGamma is only relevant relative to float. Big gamma matters more on small stocks. You will form your own opinions and trade accordingly, and if this sub lately is any indication, you'll read ALL information as UBER BULLISH for the stock you YOLOed on. But here are my interpretations coldly reading the data:\n\n**GME** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nRelevance: Very high - Big swings could cause MM's to buy/sell 1/3 of floating shares easily.\n\nReading: Somewhat bearish with bearish trend especially right above $40, but possibility of strong bull case on good bid. There is a LOT of gamma ramp, and looking at the picture, we are more 'on top' of the gamma than \"on bottom\" of the gamma. It turns out that the bears favor the \"on top\" position w/ regards to gamma. People have added a lot of bearish bets in the past few days in the form of puts under this price, which are fuel for the fire down, and can be seen in the graph as put positions. A lot more gamma ramp on net below than above. Bulls should be secure if this stock can get to the low 40s and stay there. If it starts moving down, it will run fast and then slow down at 36/37, then slow down again at 31/32/33.  Good news is that because of all this new put vol, the price action will be less naturally down in the base case as dealers dump their hedges as time goes forward, pushing price up gradually.\n\n**BB** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nRelevance: High. Big swings could cause MMs to buy/sell 1/3 of floating shares.\n\nReading: Bearish, with bullish trend. This was arguably bearish yesterday because we were at the top of a ramp. Since then, peopl ehave establsihed a lot of new positions beginning to form a bullish ramp. Bad news can send this back to 10 quickly, but not much lower quickly. Accumulation of new calls should start to make moving up a possibility though if people keep buying.\n\n**PLTR** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nRelevance: Moderate. Float is theoretically a billion shares, and swings could make MMs buy/sell perhaps 1/4 to 1/5 of that.\n\nReading: Slightly bullish. There's a sharp ramp down, but also up.. and  a strong buying trend will move this up, and there's large block of gamma at $30.\n\n**ICLN:** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nRelevance: Low. Why? Because this is an ETF that can be made/destroyed by issuer on demand.\n\nReading: Actually a little bullish. This is so much gamma ahead of price that it will cause a couple hundred million dollars of clean energy buying on a decent day. I know, weird?\n\n**TSLA:** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nAs usual a gamma monster, hard to read. 750m float shares.\n\nRelevance: Lowish. Not that much gamma compared to float.\n\nReading: Bullish. Most of the gamma is above current price.\n\n**TLRY:** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nHuge OI on this one. 136m shares avail. Nearby gamma is something like 50m.\n\nRelevance: High to very high. Maybe 1/3 or shares could turnover in some situations.\n\nReading: A bit bullish. Kind of in the middle of it all. Stock could move up fast on good buying pressure and get to low 20s on gamma.\n\n**NIO:** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nRelevance:  Moderate to \"almost moderate\". It's something like 20% of float near price in hedging obligations in aggressive cases.\n\nReading: Bullish. Gamma mostly above current price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My relevant positions:**\n\nNo positions on most of these.\n\nShort GME on puts.\n\nLong term holder of TSLA shares **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nLong BBBY on calls, but didn't do the gamma chart of it here.
