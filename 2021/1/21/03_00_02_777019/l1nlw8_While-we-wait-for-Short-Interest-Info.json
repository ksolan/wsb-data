{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "My initial post wasn't showing up on the page because I believe it had too many words. I wanted to write some points toward why GME is going to fly to the moon regardless of the short squeeze. If you're not a gamer then maybe this will provide some insight. \n\nGamestop has been moving away from physical sales in a big way and I believe there are a few things happening in the gaming industry that Ryan Cohen sees as priceless. \n\n**My overall point: Ryan Cohen isn't buying Gamestop to just drive E-Commerce. RC wants to turn Gamestop into the most beloved Gaming Culture company on the planet.** \n\nGaming is a huge industry. As a matter of fact, it's the largest entertainment industry in the world. 180 Billion tendies big and it's growing at such a fast rate it's expected to almost double by 2025. Gamestop is already positioned as one of the most recognizable gaming brands but they are known for not having quality customer service. RC has spoken a lot about how Customer Service and brand loyalty is his primary focus. If he can accomplish this, Gamestop will not have competition in the gaming industry in 5 years. I'm going to make the following points succinct.\n\n1) MSFT and GME have a deal for revenue share. It is reported that Gamestop also has something similar with Sony.\n\n2) Scalpers have ruined new console and PC parts sales for everyone. Inventory shortages are a real problem and Gamestops partnerships are a big part of solving this. here's why: I believe that Gamestop is organizing deals that not only revenue share, but also give them inventory priority. Want to buy the new Xbox? Go to Gamestop. Want to buy the new AMDs? Go to Gamestop.\n\n3) PC Build a Centers - This concept supports my statement in number 2. If Gamestop has a build a PC center arrangement, I would bet my money (and I quite literally have) that Gamestop is arranging inventory priority on the new chipsets and GPUs. It would not surprise me to see GME make deals with Intel and/or AMD to make this happen.\n\n4) Culture - ESports and Streaming are a huge hit. There are 140 Million unique visitors to Twitch on a monthly basis. They have arenas dedicated to ESports that get SOLD OUT. Imagine Gamestop hosting (successfully) local tournaments at their newly refreshed centers. Gamers will recognize Gamestop as an ally to the culture, not just a retailer. \n\n5) Subscriptions - Here's where the MSFT deal is bigger than I think it's being talked about. MSFT did something interesting with their next-gen consoles. They had a deal where you paid 24.99 a month for 2 years for the new console and got a Gamepass subscription included. \n\n6) Gamestop has talked about creating a digital trade-in platform Which would be huge in the gaming industry. I personally own at least 2K worth of digital games I haven't played in years and can't get rid of. \n\nCombine all of my points and I believe RC is looking to partner Gamestop's Power Up Rewards with MSFT Gamepass, along with some form of digital trade-in platform. Subscriptions are profitable.  Gamestop and MSFT partnership is fucking massive. Imagine Gamestop's ECommerce platform being the main medium that Microsoft uses for game purchases and trade-ins. PC game sales through MSFT store, Xbox store, all run on Gamestops platform. They Rev share all digital purchases and trade-ins and MSFT uses Gamestops physical locations to push their PC sales. \n\nSorry for the wall of text but this where my head at. I'm a fucking nerd I get it but Gamestop is known by every single gamer. If they can position themselves as part of the culture and not a blood-sucking retailer, it's game over for the competition. \n\nI believe Ryan Cohen can accomplish this.", "author_fullname": "t2_oa4tq", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "While we wait for Short Interest Info", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Discussion"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_l1nlw8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 85, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 85, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_2": 1}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1611220705.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My initial post wasn&#39;t showing up on the page because I believe it had too many words.
