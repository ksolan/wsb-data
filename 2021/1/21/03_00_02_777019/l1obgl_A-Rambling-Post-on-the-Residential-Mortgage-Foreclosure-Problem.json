{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": " \n\nI work in the private mortgage banking industry; specifically, I work with distressed debt portfolios and the utilization of Mortgage Servicing Rights as a financial hedge in mitigating credit losses. I also enjoy thinking about the wider US economy because, well, I'm autistic I guess. I am on a bunch of Adderall, and wanted to voice my rambling thoughts about a macro trend unraveling in the US housing market.\n\nSince you, like me, are aimlessly scrolling through the vast news and information flows that rule our mind, I am going to assume you have become aware of two things.\n\n1. With historically low rates, mortgage applications are at **decade long highs**, with lenders and processors working overtime and hiring like crazy. We're talking *massive growth* even in established lending units at large financial institutions. If you work in banking or finance, you may likewise get inundated with scores of job openings for \"closers, processors, auditors, compliance\" etc. in medium to large sized mortgage origination operations.\n2. Due to the massive, lasting unemployment in sectors ravaged by the current COVID pandemic, there are tens of millions of American workers currently in distressed housing situations, representing billions of dollars in unpaid mortgage and rent. With federal moratoriums in place, many debtors are protected by current orders from both foreclosures and evictions. Millions of American homeowners have required prolonged payment deferments in order to prevent their mortgage from going in to default.\n\nIf you are not interested in reading a massive ramble about my thoughts on these two contrasting points, I'd advise backing out now.\n\nTopic 1 is fascinating in itself, and I would be happy to put together another post delving further into things like rates, the effect on asset prices, etc. if there is demand. However I want to focus on one key thing: The increased volume of mortgage applications, combined with a lack of new supply in the housing market, is leading to **extremely high asset prices, and thus much larger mortgages.** This may seem all too familiar.\n\nHowever, my focus is on *distressed* debt, or credit, depending on how you look at it. The number of loans that are over 90 days delinquent on their mortgage payments has been rising rapidly over the past several months, as extended unemployment leaves unprotected borrowers further and further behind. Currently, in one portfolio, the average borrower in a 90+ day default had arrearage of over $5,500.00. When the COVID pandemic first struck the economy, the US government instituted a policy that all of it's Government Sponsored Entities would offer up to a 12 month payment deferment to debtors. This policy did **not apply to private mortgages,** and while many private lenders did institute their own deferment policies for a period, they have somewhat slowly begun proceeding legally on defaulted loans again in recent months. Biden has just extended this moratorium through September of 2021.\n\nWhen a borrower defaults on a mortgage, the lender's only recourse to re-coup their credit loss is to execute a foreclosure on the property, allowing the lender to take possession of the home and resell the asset - using the proceeds of the sale to cover the losses incurred on the mortgage. Executing a foreclosure takes substantial time and money, even a completely uncontested foreclosure can take up to a year, and cost say $5,000.00 in attorney fees alone - with the moratoriums on foreclosures and evictions in place, lenders have no way to take possession of their assets and resell them on them market, costing even more time and money. However, there is nothing stopping lenders from doing *everything but foreclosing/evicting* in the judicial process, with just the final step of eviction being blocked. Because of this, the US has a HUGE number of cases piling up where as **soon** as the courts say \"Go\" - we will see a torrent of evictions being filed, likely hundreds of thousands, as banks move to take possession of homes that are severely defaulted.\n\nTheoretically, the flood of new inventory on the housing market, with potentially millions of more foreclosures and rental units/apartments coming on the market once evictions resume as well - should serve to b**ring down the relative cost of housing** in those markets to a proportionate degree. In reality, the only areas that have **truly** high rates of default and significant foreclosure action, are already struggling areas dominated by industries flipped upside down by COVID. Counties where families are earning less than the state's average, where low wage, service based jobs dominate, entire towns that are reliant on single sectors like energy.. These individuals do not all live in houses that have benefitted from the rising tide of asset prices, or else they would have **already** refinanced, or sold, to cure the default. There are millions of Americans currently facing this reality, and the reality of several million homeless, desperate, Americans see each day is that **housing prices are at an all time high, the stock market is soaring, people are so comfortably wealthy that Peloton can become a thing.** I believe that if we do not do something NOW to address the root cause of what is truly a disgusting problem, we are going to see a massive decrease in the quality of life in America, massive unnecessary suffering, and cause untold problems for the future of our country. We could see a literal peasant revolt.\n\nThe only question now, is what will the coming months look like? Will we see a progressive revolution in the mortgage financing industry, with sweeping new regulatory changes and massive homeowner relief programs? Or will we see inaction and untold hardship? Do massive financial losses come either way? I have no idea of the answer to any of these questions, though I do have my thoughts. I'm curious to hear yours.\n\nTLDR: PPL are fucked.\n\nEdit: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "author_fullname": "t2_kq0ce", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "A Rambling Post on the Residential Mortgage Foreclosure Problem", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Discussion"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_l1obgl", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 55, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 55, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1611194916.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_2": 1}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1611223025.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I work in the private mortgage banking industry; specifically, I work with distressed debt portfolios and the utilization of Mortgage Servicing Rights as a financial hedge in mitigating credit losses.
