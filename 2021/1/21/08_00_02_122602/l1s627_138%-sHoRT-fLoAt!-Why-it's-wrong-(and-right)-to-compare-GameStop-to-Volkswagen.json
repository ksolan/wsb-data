{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Conservative estimate on why GME will squeeze to $69 ($68.85) AT THE MINIMUM.  \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\nI've seen a bunch of people on here directly comparing the Volkswagen short float (13%) back in '08 to Gamestop's short float (138%). And since GME has 10x the shorts, it'll squeeze harder or 10x harder. Stop doing that. Here's why.\n\nFirst, you have to understand why Volkswagen squeezed so hard. While a 13% short float seems insignificant, what happened was Porsche secretly gobbled almost all shares of Volkswagen behind everyone's backs. Then one day, they announced that only 1% of shares were left in the public float (% of shares available to retail investors basically). Hence,  shorts rushed to close and Volkswagen squeezed. What's important to take from this is that the effective short float was 13 times the true public float. This 13:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions was what caused Volkswagen to triple (2.9x) from \u20ac348 to over \u20ac1K in the single day that it squeezed.\n\nAs for GameStop, 138% is the short float that gets thrown on here pretty often, but this is dumb. While this is true, it doesn't take into account all the diamond handers and institutional investors other than Cohen and execs. If there truly were a 1.38:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions, GameStop wouldn't squeeze that hard - but there isn't. So I went ahead and calculated the true, effective short float of GameStop so we can compare it to Volkswagen. These numbers are VERY conservative. I didn't include many Hedge Funds who filed 13Fs; while some might diamond hand through these times, we'll never know. So I only included Cohen, ETFs such as Vanguard who won't sell, Mutual Funds, and WSB. I included the two biggest WSB whales u/DeepFuckingValue and u/LemniscateSideEight and placed WSB institutional ownership at a conservative 5% based on a bunch of studies (done months ago so it's probably increased since then).\n\nInstitutional Certified Diamond Handers\n\n|**Fund**|**Shares Held**|**% O/S**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC|9,534,090|13.67|\n|RC Ventures LLC|9,001,000|12.91|\n|BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A.|7,897,907|11.32|\n|Fidelity Series Intrinsic Opportunities Fund|6,801,757|9.75|\n|The Vanguard Group, Inc.|5,288,116|7.58|\n|iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF|3,514,708|5.04|\n|Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund|2,000,679|2.87|\n|Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund|1,468,071|2.1|\n|iShares Russell 2000 ETF|1,368,843|1.96|\n|DFA U.S. Small Cap Value Portfolio|1,121,503|1.61|\n|Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund|817,863|1.17|\n|Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund|703,551|1.01|\n|Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund|634,259|0.91|\n|WSB: DeepFuckingValue|50,000|0.07|\n|WSB: LemniscateSideEight|1,562,262|2.24|\n|rest of WSB estimation|3,800,000|5.4|\n\nOutstanding shares (not the public float) is 69.7M (nice). The people that won't sell or diamond handers adds up to 55.5M shares. Subtract that from the outstanding shares 69.7M-55.5M and we get a true public float or shares floating around of 14.2M. So based on this super conservative estimation, not including Hedge funds and most individual retail investors, we've come to an effective short float of 14.2M. If you take the latest short interest of 71M shorted shares, you get a 5:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions. This is not as great as Volkswagen's 13:1 ratio, but it's still solid. Obviously, this stuff isn't linearly correlated and is more complex, but assuming GameStop squeezes 5/13 as much as Volkswagen, GameStop will squeeze 76% instead of Volkswagen's 190%. A 76% from GameStop's current share price of $39.12 is $68.85, so basically $69 (nice)!\n\nAgain, these were conservative calculations, if you play around with the numbers and include the 2 largest funds not included: Susquehanna International Group, LLP with 4.4M shares and Dimensional Fund Advisors, L.P. with 3.9M shares, this reduces the true ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions to 12:1, which basically matches Volkwagen's 13:1 scenario that tripled the stock so you could expect a GME squeeze \\~$120 from this scenario.", "author_fullname": "t2_4wmdu5l2", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "138% sHoRT fLoAt!
