{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Conservative estimate on why GME will squeeze to $69 ($68.85) AT THE MINIMUM.  \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\nI've seen a bunch of people on here directly comparing the Volkswagen short float (13%) back in '08 to Gamestop's short float (138%). And since GME has 10x the shorts, it'll squeeze harder or 10x harder. Stop doing that. Here's why.\n\nFirst, you have to understand why Volkswagen squeezed so hard. While a 13% short float seems insignificant, what happened was Porsche secretly gobbled almost all shares of Volkswagen behind everyone's backs. Then one day, they announced that only 1% of shares were left in the public float (% of shares available to retail investors basically). Hence,  shorts rushed to close and Volkswagen squeezed. What's important to take from this is that the effective short float was 13 times the true public float. This 13:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions was what caused Volkswagen to triple (2.9x) from \u20ac348 to over \u20ac1K in the single day that it squeezed.\n\nAs for GameStop, 138% is the short float that gets thrown on here pretty often, but this is dumb. While this is true, it doesn't take into account all the diamond handers and institutional investors other than Cohen and execs. If there truly were a 1.38:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions, GameStop wouldn't squeeze that hard - but there isn't. So I went ahead and calculated the true, effective short float of GameStop so we can compare it to Volkswagen. These numbers are VERY conservative. I didn't include many Hedge Funds who filed 13Fs; while some might diamond hand through these times, we'll never know. So I only included Cohen, ETFs such as Vanguard who won't sell, Mutual Funds, and WSB. I included the two biggest WSB whales u/DeepFuckingValue and u/LemniscateSideEight and placed WSB institutional ownership at a conservative 5% based on a bunch of studies (done months ago so it's probably increased since then).\n\nInstitutional Certified Diamond Handers\n\n|**Fund**|**Shares Held**|**% O/S**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC|9,534,090|13.67|\n|RC Ventures LLC|9,001,000|12.91|\n|BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A.|7,897,907|11.32|\n|Fidelity Series Intrinsic Opportunities Fund|6,801,757|9.75|\n|The Vanguard Group, Inc.|5,288,116|7.58|\n|iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF|3,514,708|5.04|\n|Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund|2,000,679|2.87|\n|Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund|1,468,071|2.1|\n|iShares Russell 2000 ETF|1,368,843|1.96|\n|DFA U.S. Small Cap Value Portfolio|1,121,503|1.61|\n|Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund|817,863|1.17|\n|Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund|703,551|1.01|\n|Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund|634,259|0.91|\n|WSB: DeepFuckingValue|50,000|0.07|\n|WSB: LemniscateSideEight|1,562,262|2.24|\n|rest of WSB estimation|3,800,000|5.4|\n\nOutstanding shares (not the public float) is 69.7M (nice). The people that won't sell or diamond handers adds up to 55.5M shares. Subtract that from the outstanding shares 69.7M-55.5M and we get a true public float or shares floating around of 14.2M. So based on this super conservative estimation, not including Hedge funds and most individual retail investors, we've come to an effective short float of 14.2M. If you take the latest short interest of 71M shorted shares, you get a 5:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions. This is not as great as Volkswagen's 13:1 ratio, but it's still solid. Obviously, this stuff isn't linearly correlated and is more complex, but assuming GameStop squeezes 5/13 as much as Volkswagen, GameStop will squeeze 76% instead of Volkswagen's 190%. A 76% from GameStop's current share price of $39.12 is $68.85, so basically $69 (nice)!\n\nAgain, these were conservative calculations, if you play around with the numbers and include the 2 largest funds not included: Susquehanna International Group, LLP with 4.4M shares and Dimensional Fund Advisors, L.P. with 3.9M shares, this reduces the true ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions to 12:1, which basically matches Volkwagen's 13:1 scenario that tripled the stock so you could expect a GME squeeze \\~$120 from this scenario.", "author_fullname": "t2_4wmdu5l2", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "138% sHoRT fLoAt!

You don't just execute a buy or sell of 1M shares @ $40, it's a thousand here, thousand there and the algo tries to get you the best price possible. Often you'll see dips, massive buy spikes, then buy/sell walls go up at price points where their average is to try and build a retail base also. Considering originally there was a low percentage of outstanding shares traded per day, building that base will take time because institutional ownership is so huge. Once that is built, they just have to counter act any shorts, and see even 50 basis point increase in volume could set this entire thing off.\n\nThose short attacks will stop once the shorts get out of their position but the base will remain and the hunger for the shares will remain. If the short float drops a bit, it actually will help us believe it or not, because the people that are going to get fucked here aren't the institutional traders - it's the big retail whales and 9 figure individuals betting against this. The big firms are already hedged, I promise you.\n\nWith the short volume being met by institutional buying volume, I estimate the actual float to be much, much, much smaller than the numbers we're seeing. Institutional ownership is over 100% -- this is ONLY possible by buying synthetic shares that are shorted.\n\nAll of this combined shows me that we have firms going at each other. A couple retail whales come in and upset that balance of power, and we're going to see this thing rip upwards. What you're likely seeing is firms day trading calls on swings (yes, calls, not puts) and forcing those swings to help them profit some, then cover some of their shares and slowly reduce the delta of their positions. They're not trading puts because that just exaggerates their delta, they trade the calls in case the thing fucking flies to the moon, their losses are capped as it sits now, and they're likely trading portions of their share position. 10% at a time, and if they have enough capital, they can drag this fight out for a long fucking time. There's no benefit for them to unwind all at once, it could set this thing into the stratosphere. It's potentially possible many of them have various dated $20 calls to help cover their short (and by possible, I mean likely, because the algos probably hedged as soon as it saw the price/volume explode when it moved off the $20 mark and identified the possible buttfucking their short position was about to give them) and they're just slamming volume around trying to create volatility because that's the best for the people writing the options (them and their friends). For all we know, some of these shorts are completely hedged just building it up to profit off the squeeze. If the shares rip up once they get out of the position, they don't care, because they'll hold to expiration for hedge, exercise, take the gains, and tank the stock again and short it on the way down while hedging the upside again. If the stock goes down, they can dump the calls and just let their short ride back down a ways. The calls are their cap -- similar to people buying a debit spread instead of long calls.\n\nBut with Melvin's puts likely expired and not re-upped in any identifiable way, that means we know one guy is really under the heat and already way fucking down on his position, which causes desperation. Humans can only take so much. Match that up with Citron's extreme fucking failures over the course of the last two years, we got a couple guys with reputations and millions on the line.\n\n***TLDR:*** If you're in the industry, you have access to shit others don't. I can watch a price/volume chart during the day and instantly identify institutional activity, I mark the chart, I go back. No, I cannot share the sources or reports I have, they're NDA. Yes, I'm likely breaking that just by making this post.\n\nDo I give a fuck? No, because fuck Melvin. It's one thing to be in a firm and short a stock for fundamental reasons. It's a whole other thing to let your ego get in the way after you drove the price down to $3 and go for the jugular just to make yourself feel better. The guy deserves the fucking $200-$300M loss he's about to eat at the current price, probably more considering the options he had expired and he's likely got some other hedges in place that won't work out for him.\n\nThis isn't to flex my knowledge, it's to tell people you should be careful just spreading info around this board and getting people on board with a thesis.
