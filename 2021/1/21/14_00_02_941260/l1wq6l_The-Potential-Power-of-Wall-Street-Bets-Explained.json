We\u2019ve already done exceptional with the little money we have in our Robinhood accounts. With actual power to really move markets, the sheer willpower of this sub and hive mind retardedness is something we shall strive for. \n\nWithin two weeks Blackberry will probs trade at around 15-20$ a share. Once GAmestop gang returns from Saturn, we all pay the tax men (while most since some of you guys are autistic), Gamestop gang will ride the Battle Bus to victory, and increase our net worth even more. \n\n\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of posts lately like \u201cI have 500$ what should I invest in\u201d.
