There have been many justified accusations of stock manipulation, illegal naked short selling, and other less than ethical tactics, all with the goal of tanking the price of one stock or another. \n\nThat doesnt have to be the case. The US for the greater part of a century banned short selling during a downtick on a stock, as a result of the 1929 stock market crash. This regulation was always in effect, and was only removed from constant application to become a temporary condition in 2007. This is the rule that many new autists among us became acquainted with through GME this past Friday, as it takes effect when a stock drops 10% and applies through 2 trading days. Short selling was also temporarily completely halted during the 2008 financial crises. This is completely aside from questions of whether and how well the SEC enforces other rules still on the books, such as the banning of abusive naked short selling, which is still very much practiced despite the law against it.\n\nWhat does this have to do with you? Well, if you live in the US, you happen to have a handy dandy individual assigned to represent you in the United States House of Representatives. How well they do so is of course, completely up to speculation, but its undeniable that each and every one of them cares about getting reelected, and about campaign donations. As a result, petitioning to either reintroduce previous restrictions on short selling, or question the SEC on failing to enforce their own regulations against abusive short selling tactics is actually highly likely to find a receptive ear with your representative no matter which side of the aisle they find themselves on. Why? Because the vast majority of Americans have their retirement tied up in 401ks, we're in a pandemic with detrimental effects on the market, and short sellers arent exactly popular with a lot of corporate America either. The last thing a hotshot CEO with a multimillion dollar kicker riding on his company's stock performance wants is for a short seller like Shitron to release a video explaining why they hate him, and then short his company into the ground with nonexistent shares while the SEC throws their failure to deliver list on the stack of unread magazines in the break room.\n\nSo, if shorts like Melvin, Shitron, and every other megabear who treat market manipulation as their daily job piss you off, pick up your phone and start dialing. Open up your reps website and send that email. Stop by in person. I guarantee they have an office close by, and a representative designated to talk to the public and pass along concerns.
