Why is that important you might ask or worthy of being a catalyst for PLTR?\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n2 Reasons:\n\n1. They are releasing Titan.  It is a direct upgrade of Gotham based on 10 years of learning.  Titan is going to be more \"performant, open and proactive\".  PAUSE: Look carefully at those words, performant and proactive...  Based on that and the fact that the Chief Operating Officer called it a \"force multiplier\", I am speculating that Titan will include a stronger AI integration.  If this is true Titan will be an exponentially more efficient system that requires less user input for final analysis.  Why is this important?  Palantir gives a lot of contracts that expire but leave the user with the old version of the software even if not renewed.  If Titan is such a pivotal upgrade of less user input (AI integration) and Greater magnitude (hence \"open\")  it will be a necessary upgrade and spur a new round of contracts.  And based on Palantir's fundamentals, startup costs for new programs like Titan are higher than renewals, so this means                            \n  TENDIES ALL AROUND\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n2. Currently there is a certain element of unknown associated with Palantir and what exactly it does.  The only demo we have is from a much older platform and doesn't show all the features to the public.  I think a huge barrier to the excitement we have to this stock is that we have done our research and know what Palantir does.  As soon as this is exposed to the public it will be a game changer for the amount of attention Palantir is getting and thereafter the demand for Palantir shares.  This stock is not on most peoples radar because they do not interact with it as they do other brands.  The demo will be a blow to this aspect and increase interest from investors and demand from customers eager to upgrade to the new technology.  It is also going to give this company the traction it needs to MOON and finally retain those day gains.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nIf that wasn't enough for you Retards, there's MORE! \n\nWe are now post inauguration of President Joe Biden.  He is eager to prove that he will handle the pandemic better than Trump did (And has already signed a number of Executive Orders pertaining to Covid-19 policy).  The single best way for Biden to make this happen is quick vaccine distribution.  Here is where PLTR comes in, Alexander Carp, CEO, recently interviewed with the Washington Post describing how Palantir can be used to distribute vaccine doses to maximum efficiency and to optimize limiting the spread of Covid-19.  Earlier this year it signed a contract(25M) with the Department of Human and Health Services to analyze Covid-19 data and give a path to the most effective vaccine distribution, this program was called Tiberius.  If the Biden administration can make quick work of this vaccine distribution and make the US a model, it will bring Tiberius to the forefront.  This will open the opportunity to license it other governments and also large healthcare companies such as chain doctors offices, nursing homes etc. to distribute their share of vaccines most effectively internally.   \n\nWhen this happens PLTR will Fucking Print\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nThis is an incredibly understated value, we have a compelling shared interest with the brand new president.  The value that this has for the stock long is incredible.  It will put PLTR to the front of the line for contract renewals as a trusted agency that acted as a saving grace to the administration in the first of its 4 YEARS.  This on top of the fact that they have little competition to begin with means we will be looking through our telescopes to find the shares \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nIf nothing else, our beloved Cathie Woods (everything she touches basically moons) just stocked up on a JUICY 498,000 Shares for her \\[ARKK\\] ETF\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nPosition/ 80 shares \\~$25\n\nTLDR: Next Gen software catches bad guys and can also be used by businesses.
