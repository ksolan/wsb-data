We're going to the fooking moon.\n\n**WHAT IS PALANTIR?**\n\nPalantir is a SaaS (software as a service) company that provides governments and companies with advanced data analysis tools. In other words, Palantir gets paid to help organizations understand their disparate data in novel and valuable ways.\n\nPalantir has three main products:\n\n* Gotham: One of Palantir's earliest products used primarily by governments to perform general purpose data analyses on a broad data set (e.g. geospatial and statistical analysis). Gotham is very useful in discovering bad actors in a system.\n* Foundry: A newer product targeted at businesses to help make forward-looking business decisions. Foundry is designed for ease of use by a large team of data analysts working on the same data sets, as is commonly found in companies.\n* Apollo: A world-class continuous deployment system, Apollo allows Palantir to rapidly deploy upgrades to their software whether it's hosted in in-house data centers or in their customers's data centers.\n\n**WHY PALANTIR?**\n\n* SOLID GROWTH: Average revenue per customer grew at an annual rate of 30% since 2009 and contribution margins (margins per product) improved by 4x since 2019. In addition, top line revenue grew by 24.7% in 2019 and is expected to grow by more than 40% in 2020 due to COVID.\n* SIGNIFICANT EARLY INVESTMENT, CLOSE TO PROFITABLE: bears say \"NoT pRoFiTaBlE In 17 yEaRs\". Bulls know this is actually bullish. Big investment = big rewards and Palantir's three flagship products are paying off now\n* WORLD-CLASS TECHNOLOGY: Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo are state-of-the-art technology. Just watch some of their tech talks and investor presentations. Truly impressive.\n* LACK OF COMPETITION: Peter Thiel thinks that competitions are for losers. Do you know what else is for losers? Being a PLTR bear. But also, PLTR has no competition. No other company is able to do broad data analysis from random data sources like they can. No other company is willing to work w/ government like PLTR is willing to.\n* LEGAL PRECEDENCE: PLTR literally sued the Army for not using them, and WON.\n* SKYWISE CASE STUDY: worked with Airbus to increase A350 production rate by 33%. Now they created an open data platform called Skywise that more than 100 airlines are using.\n\n**BUT WATCH OUT FOR...**\n\n* LOCK-UP PERIOD EXPIRY: after the first earnings call in 2021, about 1.4B new shares should hit the market. So far there're only 244 million shares on the market. That's a bigly increase to float. But I don't expect a lot more extra selling. The insiders are probably just as or more bullish about PLTR.\n* BIG CONTRACT RISK: PLTR's $1B revenue consists of several large contracts, like one that is $300 million.
