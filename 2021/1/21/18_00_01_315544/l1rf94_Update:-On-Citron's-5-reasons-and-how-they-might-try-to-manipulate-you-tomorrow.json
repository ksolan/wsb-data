Also definitely worth an extensive read is [this amazing DD, on its own website](https://www.gmedd.com/).\n\nGME is on a trajectory to do some pretty cool things, even without the short squeeze that has everyone excited. Long buyers are in. **News people are starting to pivot more and more as of Wednesday, they cannot deny the trajectory in the face of continued shorting.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost likely things they will cite are:\n\n1. Total sales declined 3.1% in the holiday sales report\n2. Large 3rd quarter sales declines (pre-covid vs post-covid the most likely cause).\n3. Closed 11% of stores (which they did to cut underperforming stores, and because their stores are FAR too dense, especially given an increased focus on E-commerce)\n4. Unavailability of consoles (as if this has anything to do with Gamestop)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost likely things they will intentionally leave out:\n\n1. Comparable store sales increased 4.8% in holiday report (so, decrease above likely because of store closures)\n2. E-commerce is at 34% of company sales, equivalent to Best Buy percentage (and growing rapidly, and more rapidly than Best Buy)\n3. Regional sales in Australia/New Zealand (no covid) went UP 31%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Reason 2: Insiders are selling\n\nThis is true. But here are the facts that they will leave out:\n\n1/12/21-1/13/21: Hestia Capital (whose managing member is Wolf Kurt James) sold 945,550 shares of GME for this reason \"in order to better align with the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of Hestia Capital\". The fund still owns 91,000 shares and Wolf Kurt James PERSONALLY AND DIRECTLY still owns 50,689 (including 20,000 of his wife's shares).\n\nAlso,\n\n1/13/21: Dunn Lizabeth sold 5,000 shares of GME.

She still owns 79,537.\n\nThe forms regarding the previous 3 people's sales were all filed by Dunn Lizabeth, suggesting that they sold as a coordinated choice. Also, all three of those people are NOT on the Board of Directors as proposed by RC Ventures (and conditionally agreed to by Gamestop, an agreement they'll almost definitely keep given the huge increases in share price upon RC Ventures' buy-in and policy changes that RC Ventures has strongly suggested/recommended)\n\nSource: [SEC Filings](https://sec.report/Ticker/GME)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Reason 3: Some form of WSB bashing\n\n1. They will likely ascribe most if not all of the upward trajectory of Gamestop to WSB. This is not entirely false: this subreddit, the repeated DDs on it, and people's \"rabid\" attention has indeed contributed to the upward trajectory. This is the age of the individual investor though, and the way media works has changed. There is nothing shady or inappropriate about large groups of people believing in something and then pursuing and/or betting on its success. This is exactly what the MM's do, the difference is that they have few people moving lots of money, and WSB has lots of people each moving a little money.\n2. Y'all have been rude AF. Not saying anything against it, I'm just saying that there will be backlash to the kind of savagery we've seen against Citron and Melvin in the past few days. They will call you rabid, they will call you crazy idiots, they will call you insane gamblers, they will imply (but never say on air) that you are \"autists\" and \"retards\"...and in ~~some~~ most cases, they'll even be right. However, I hope that anyone reading this who isn't a WSB fanatic will recognize that the movement of this stock, while inspired by such fanaticism, is not based on some rabid fanaticism alone (See #1, see the hundreds of tickers posted here every day).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Reason 4: The short squeeze has already happened\n\n1. Now here, I expect them to throw up some fancy crayon data analysis looking at shares shorted or available to short or short interest % of daily trading or fees to short and try and pretend like that number really means that the shorts have already covered. Here's the important data (there's some in the DD in #1 as well).\n\nFirst, [Short interest was higher than float as of EOD Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzwo2z/gme_short_interest_declined_to_71m_and_some_other/), and [still higher than float at EOD Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l18jvw/gme_short_interest_update_703m_shares_short/), meaning there is an absolutely obscene # of shorted shares (a \"high\" number is often cited as 20-30%, we're at 100%). We'll see updated numbers for EOD Wednesday in the early morning. Short interest actually INCREASED during the Wed-Thurs time that Citron was originally saying was the short squeeze. Now, these are Ortex estimates based on the self-reported shares short at a large aggregate of brokerages, but have been very reliable  when compared to the official SEC data that comes out every half a month.\n\n**Important Update here based on re-analysis.**\n\n**The # of shorted shares from Wed-Fri was approximately 71.4M (approximately the current # of shares short). Citron's analysis will say that shorters have COVERED their original shorts, and what we are seeing now are NEW shorts at higher price points (less pressure). I think they are partially correct. However:**\n\n**1) Shorters will have wanted to drive down price on Wed onward.** This means that the shorted shares are not necessarily new opened shorts that are still open, but may have been temporary shorts that were covered on the same day. We have seen a lot of temporary shorting in the past few days, so at least some of the shorts were due to this. In fact, I expect that a very large number of those 71.4M shorted shares were temporary shorts, based on the number of shares sold short each day over the past few months (millions per day) and the overall changes in the total number of shorted shares over the same period (almost none, relatively).\n\n**2) Shorts have been re-opened.** The difference between their loss on a new short after covering an old short, or from holding the original short is the difference in price between those two shorts (could be as high as $20, but that's only for some of the shorts). However, **the fact that a similar level of % short/float exists today means that the EXACT SAME potential for a short squeeze is present** even if these are new shorts, but the pressure is somewhat lower as the current price MIGHT be closer to the short price.\n\n**3) With GME's current trajectory (even if we discount Wednesday's meteoric rise and just look at the last 6 months), even those hypothetical higher price point shorts are still in significant danger.** If they weren't, we wouldn't be seeing this huge pushback from media and such aggressive market manipulation (see Tuesday's 2x1M share sell-offs).\n\nBONUS) It's important to note that the borrowing fees, while not insignificant, are reasonably trivial for a large institution. It amounts to something like $0.03 per day per share, even at 30% on a $40 stock. They can hold for a month and if they make $1 per share, they're still up. However, this adds up. Also, eventually, the broker will need to fill real share buy orders and can force an immediate sale. Finally, if trajectory continues to go up, it just stops being worth trying to short it and someone will start a selling chain, driving up price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Reason 5: More shares traded on some days than are short. Meaning days to cover is not close to accurate.\n\nThis is absolutely true. Days to cover is based on an average of the daily volume over the past few days. What they will say is that because daily volume is higher then shorts can cover very easily. Here's three reasons I disagree:\n\n1. the volume shorted over the past week has consistently been around 20%+ of the daily volume. Therefore we can discount 20% of the volume as that has no net effect on the number of shorts.\n2. any increase in volatility of a stock will lead to increased trading. That means more sellers, but also more buyers. **The days to cover metric is based ONLY on volume. That means that it assumes that every share bought is bought to replace a shorted share. That is unlikely to ever be the case, especially in today's market which is saturated by retail investors because of trading apps. They're using 1900s math in 2021.**\n3. Trading volume has actually been decreasing since last Wednesday, while % short hasn't changed, so current volumes will mean more time to cover again compared to last Wednesday (even though days to cover isn't the greatest measure). So this is less and less in the shorters' favor as volume decreases, and we have a similar % short/float.\n\n# So what will happen?\n\n**THIS IS A GUESS. But, based on the sudden vanishing of shares available to short at IKBR at approximately the same time as the Citron announcement on Tuesday, I suspect tomfoolery. In addition, Citron just started doing these \"twitter Live\" things two days ago. Yes, GME wasn't the first one, but it's still a very recent new thing. At the same time, GME has had some barefaced manipulation these past few days on this sub and elsewhere in the media, not to mention the likely** [months of naked shorting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky9mu0/gme_comrades_115_update_27_consecutive_days_on/). **Citron also conveniently decided to delay their twitter live for the inauguration, as they were hoping for a higher viewership (or potential viewership), which makes perfect sense, but still seems strange that on the SECOND LIVE TWITTER THEY DID (for the good of their viewers), THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE ELECTION.**\n\nNone of this happened yesterday because yesterday was a slightly lower volume day than usual, and their strategies to drive down price require maximum exposure. If they're very aggressive and trigger SEC Rule 201 again, they're limited in their shorting options on the next day.\n\nOption 1: we have a repeat of Friday where shorters will try to immediately and early smash down GME price in hopes that it will keep going down after starting that trajectory. They can do this because SEC Rule 201 is not active (so they can short on a downtick again).\n\nOption 2: Shorters will first allow stocks to rise as they did Tuesday. Then at around 11:30 (+/- 1 hour), GME will start to tank rapidly (potentially due again to some big 1M share sells). If it was me, I would time it and hit it very hard so it hits -10% for the day (the furthest they can push it by shorting on downticks) as close to the Citron announcement as possible, with the hopes that that livestream will then push retail shorters to short more or paper-handers to sell. Remember, due to puts expiring Friday, there is likely significant pressure on shorters to drive price below $35 or as close as they can asap.\n\nOption 3: Small but steady downward pressure, in the hopes of making retail investors get bored and leave so that the stock price goes down.\n\nGamestop will also announce an influx of new consoles sometimes tomorrow. This helps push stock up, and I bet they time it to be right before Citron's twitter live if they can, and my personal hope is that there's something unexpected about this influx of new consoles (perhaps a larger number than usual due to a new deal?), but I don't expect this to have a super huge effect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Citron might have good points, but they'll leave out a lot. Find the real scoop above, and don't let them manipulate you into selling if they or their funders time some share dumps to go with their stream.  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c", "author_fullname": "t2_3dq788pe", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "Update: On Citron's 5 reasons and how they might try to manipulate you tomorrow", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_l1rf94", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 684, "total_awards_received": 10, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 684, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1611214975.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 1, "gid_2": 1, "gid_3": 1}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1611233802.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Obligatory disclaimer: I am not an expert, nor have I been doing this long.

Find the real scoop above, and don&#39;t let them manipulate you into selling if they or their funders time some share dumps to go with their stream.  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-ERE19FTA5ce0k8XHuSJSQ2B3gFuc661jtTdR0jbC6w.jpg?auto=webp&s=d4029b72b48029efe3dd5ddb0db54b19ff839d7c", "width": 286, "height": 300}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-ERE19FTA5ce0k8XHuSJSQ2B3gFuc661jtTdR0jbC6w.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=cc60d50ab032ea3aea303964ec28bbabc402a49b", "width": 108, "height": 113}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-ERE19FTA5ce0k8XHuSJSQ2B3gFuc661jtTdR0jbC6w.jpg?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9dcbc542f53f9b560180e3ca00fc36ba0758de80", "width": 216, "height": 226}], "variants": {}, "id": "ln-CI2mOo6OhjBRzT_3NdAu5TyOvYSrNT3WOuCdsY0M"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "coin_price": 1000, "id": "award_c1c6bd88-eb04-49ee-8f3b-28fbd50cc312", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "COMMUNITY", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_2th52/x7zs3jrtpmh41_Saturn.png", "days_of_premium": 0, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_2th52/x7zs3jrtpmh41_Saturn.png?width=16&height=16&auto=webp&s=84d645f2c9bf703d1c56b2cda580cf48b6f66299", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_2th52/x7zs3jrtpmh41_Saturn.png?width=32&height=32&auto=webp&s=ff8d04a247fe47de695e08a4e715707fbf1665e1", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_2th52/x7zs3jrtpmh41_Saturn.png?width=48&height=48&auto=webp&s=35beb9c10e22d12a73e8aa952fcf923ebb72dde3", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_2th52/x7zs3jrtpmh41_Saturn.png?width=64&height=64&auto=webp&s=0da4eefe21f5114c54b714d295d96edf32ae0e89", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_2th52/x7zs3jrtpmh41_Saturn.png?width=128&height=128&auto=webp&s=787496015d9ae739e2af3ac33f0cc503dc070ba6", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 750, "static_icon_width": 750, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Shows the Saturn Award and grants %{coin_symbol}200 Coins to the community.
