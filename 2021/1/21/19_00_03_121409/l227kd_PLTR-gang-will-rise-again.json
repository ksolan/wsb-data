{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**What you need to know:**\n\n*Processing img dyy8vg81gpc61...*\n\nhttps://imgur.com/Jc8ckmb\n(Image isn't uploading)\n\nPLTR is experiencing a heavy strong trend with a bull and flag. It's broken support this morning and is back up. PLTR has had positive momentum, tons of new contracts and lots of volume. It's been in this pennant and is due for a breakout. PLTR's Demo day is the 26th of Jan and earnings is Feb 11. Demo day is gonna showcase new Palantir products and outline what PLTR has in store for 2021. \n\n**A case for longs:**\n\nPalantir aims to put together software that compiles data that provides insights into potential problems, solutions to these problems, and help solve complex, real-world problems. This data and analytics is fully interactive, and machine-assisted. So far, Gotham and Foundry are Palantir's products. Gotham is the military/government grade software and Foundry is the commercial equivalent. Apollo is a program that essentially removes the need for support teams when Gotham and Foundry need an update. Apollo gives Foundry and Gotham users the luxury of updating their software like it's an IOS update. These three products are the fundamentals of PLTR\n\nPalantir's goal in the commercial and govt space is to grow in scope and scale. This prepares them for a horizontal integration. They are trying to build a wide moat for themselves in order to secure an opportunity for vertical integration as well. By preparing themselves for both vertical and horizontal integration, they are going down a road not dissimilar to that of Standard Oil. There is not a doubt in my mind that this company is run by people who know what they're doing. \n\nPLTR is now the biggest company involved in government data. The US cannot afford to have PLTR go under, and thus it will never go away- the only way is up. The real question is, how fast is it going up?\n\n\"Looking ahead, Palantir is poised to become the default central operating system for data across the U.S. government and its allies. The company also aspires to be the central operating system for data at large businesses and even entire industries. To appreciate Palantir's ambition with regard to B2B big data, it may be helpful to recall how much economic benefit has been captured by Microsoft (MSFT) after Windows OS took the lead over MacOS of Apple (AAPL) in the PC era, and by Google and Apple in the consumer mobile phone age with their respective Android and iOS operating systems.\"\n\nCompetitors in this niche tech field are quickly swatted away. BAH and ACN lack the technical power and can't compete with PLTR pricing. Even defense contractors such as RTX, BAH, SAIC, and BAESF cannot compete with the costs and user-responsiveness of PLTR. You might ask why a big shot like google isn't stepping in to work with the government, to which I would chuckle and remind you that google stated they think the pentagon is \"unethical\" and prefer to work with the Chinese government on Project Dragonfly ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly\\_(search\\_engine)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(search_engine))). \n\nI'll go ahead and rattle off some quick deductions of mine. They have an aggressive merger and acquisition campaign. To grow into adjacent verticals, they absorb companies that are already there, quickening the speed they grow at. They are Capital-light and operationally efficient. Their ROI is very high and they can sell their product with existing hardware for as long as they are the best program to use. Meaning their software needs to be installed once but can be sold as many times as they like, as long as they keep their shit together. They are seriously dominating domestically in their niche. Their wide moat due to the M&A campaign and good management for vertical + horizontal growth gives them a monopolistic outlook. They are in the captains chair. \n\n**Forward thinking**\n\nPLTR's last Q described sales growth of 46% in international sales. They want to move into Canada, Australia, UK, France and other allies of the U.S. They will very likely establish themselves there as well. They have a Foundry Joint Venture contract in Japan with Sampo Holdings for the wellbeing of the Japanese people. It was $500M. They are likely looking for a contract with Japan's government as well. \n\nMy short-term PT for PLTR is $34, passing ATH. This pennant is a strong trend and it is gonna break out hard. All signs point towards a bullish breakout so I'm loaded up on calls, overexposing myself three times with what I'm usually comfortable with exposing myself to. \n\nLong term, I can imagine PLTR breaking $100 within 2 years. With a growing need of govt software and national security, *PLTR's value can only go up*\n\n**TLDR: PLTR $34 by early Feb.**\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "author_fullname": "t2_3a9yaqpm", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "PLTR gang will rise again", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"dyy8vg81gpc61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dyy8vg81gpc61.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=eb129c0cc1988a7a5a8f3ea50c4899b095bb1c93"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dyy8vg81gpc61.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=492644e8cdeda2b66bdb037fa36edd81221f82ca"}, {"y": 179, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dyy8vg81gpc61.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5efea51fa97f8245fb85a2060d77a36b83dcd51b"}, {"y": 359, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dyy8vg81gpc61.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c05684e5a8ec996a33fe34ea5fb040fbc58e83e6"}, {"y": 539, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dyy8vg81gpc61.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4e86a42ef0d36dcd97b4cc041e0dbdb1be9c58ea"}, {"y": 606, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dyy8vg81gpc61.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5ab3fc2646484b0d7b4ffcb7193b06ab9bd57901"}], "s": {"y": 1114, "x": 1984, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dyy8vg81gpc61.png?width=1984&format=png&auto=webp&s=66f6b24d7a3ae97b44f537a68feb61114b479b6e"}, "id": "dyy8vg81gpc61"}}, "name": "t3_l227kd", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 63, "total_awards_received": 3, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": true, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 63, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/J5GXfAwEgiUTYtHWsTpGAySRC1D6naX0ZooAcRx1uDY.jpg", "edited": 1611247954.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_2": 1}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1611276451.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What you need to know:</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Processing img dyy8vg81gpc61...</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/Jc8ckmb\">https://imgur.com/Jc8ckmb</a>\n(Image isn&#39;t uploading)</p>\n\n<p>PLTR is experiencing a heavy strong trend with a bull and flag.
