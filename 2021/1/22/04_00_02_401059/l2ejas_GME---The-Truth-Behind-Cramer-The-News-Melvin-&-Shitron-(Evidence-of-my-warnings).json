They want the WSB twitter account to keep saying stupid shit like \"We are a force to be reckoned with\" so we can get thrown 6 feet under.** \n\nHi everyone,\n\nTime to finally spill the beans about what's really going on here. WSB deserves to know.\n\nLong-time lurker here. This is a crazy but true story so buckle-up for a wild-ride. Here is evidence of my conversations with the mods, before the Shitron shit went down. Most of the complex, sensitive stuff was explained via signal call with OIP. Numerous emails which would be too long too disclose and also containing sensitive info were exchanged (takes centuries to write this shit out as you can see) but here are the things which I can release. It's very hard to prove everything because it's based on a tip I got from a reliable source and I don't have a recording of my calls with him or OIP, but here's proof I can provide without compromising certain people that I know what I'm talking about:\n\n[Evidence of modmail sent before this shit. Note the \"Urgent\" before this shit went down](https://imgur.com/a/Cx6SDAT)\n\n[Initial response by u/zjz to my private mod mail warning about impending chaos by the shorts to WSB via encrypted email](https://imgur.com/a/flE9HRE)\n\n[Signal warning to OIP after mod mail message (1)](https://imgur.com/a/mVbH0FD)\n\n[Very short explanation to OIP before sleeping (2) - went into depth on a call the next day](https://imgur.com/a/HkLqOA0)\n\n[Initially dismissed by Bacon, but after initial discussions he knew I had something](https://imgur.com/a/ARR3Edp)\n\n[Evidence of call with OIP - Signal doesn't show length](https://imgur.com/a/Ti9sEU3)\n\n[End of Conversation with Bacon Futures - Backing my post (I know it's Citron not GME, accident)](https://imgur.com/a/NfGkmPD)\n\n[More conversation with OIP - references proving that I mentioned these upcoming events](https://imgur.com/a/XFc5nzz)\n\n[OIP confirming on Thursday that my warnings were true and panned out exactly how I said they would](https://imgur.com/a/5TmznIF)\n\n**Storytime:**\n\nEarlier this week (I'm British) I sent an urgent message to the mods via a private channel (truth is if I put the full details of that screenshot some people involved who may be reading this will figure out the source potentially) warning them about information I received from a hedge fund trader at a boutique British fund who happens to be in the know about a lot of things going on behind the scenes in the market (he has friends in the SEC from his time in NYC) . I contacted the mods as fast as possible, I warned of a ridiculous conspiracy, some shit uncovered that was ridiculously crazy and that the mods had to know urgently. I gave them my encrypted email and phone. I got on a Signal call with OIP for some time, but also talked to Bacon Futures and [u/zjz](https://www.reddit.com/u/zjz/) about this situation. Everything I told them panned out, in the specific ways I said (I didn't know it would be Citron tweeting, but I knew and told OIP that some unexpected people with weight and attention would get involved very soon and take on WSB head-on). Initially I was treated like a jokeman and a crazy conspiracy theorist but zjz and Bacon both came around in the end. The 3 mods I have referred to will hopefully confirm in the comment section below that I indeed did warn ahead of these events unfolding.\n\n**But anyways, it's time you guys hear what my source (London Hedge Fund PM) had to say:**\n\nHe warned that there were many more hedge funds involved with the naked short-selling of GME and that the recent short/gamma squeeze had really pissed off quite a few people who were now faced with the prospects of huge losses on their books. Ever since WSB was covered by Luke Kawa on Bloomberg, firms have been keeping an eye on the sub. But this was the final straw, when retail investors just fucked over the institutions who are so used to manipulating markets the way they want through illegal practices such as naked short-selling. They were pissed off, royally, and finally decided to do something about the growing retail investor base (WSB) who were making money too easily, and that too at their expense.\n\nTheir plan is simple.\n\n1. **First of all, get the finance world to start covering WSB again heavily. Notice how there wasn't much coverage before of all the crazy things people on this sub have bought and how far they went up?** But recently, everyone's focused on WSB. They have to push the narrative that we are out-of-control retail investors (Brits like me who use CFDs are exempt lol) who are an institution, a solid group, manipulating markets. This turns the public perception of WSB, what is a retarded forum famous for both immense gain and loss porn, into a group of highly coordinated manipulators fueled by nothing but short-term greed. **Barrons, Cramer, Seeking Alpha, Business Insider, Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal, Marketwatch, even VICE FUCKING NEWS** etc everyone's on us. Never had this much coverage. It's all paid jobs coordinated across the media to draw attention to this. It's also to draw attention away from the fact that they engaged in naked short-selling and that's a key reason why the squeeze has been so hard.\n2. **Collude together to get someone who is considered a heavyweight to intervene and take on the WSB head on, explicitly.** I told OIP on Monday that there were much bigger fish involved in this and that we'd rattled the hornet's nest and that my source didn't want to give me a name but he said they were well-known short-sellers. He said their goal was to act as the public muscle on behalf of Melvin (remember how he sucked Melvin off completely during the video?) and others with an unexpected entrance (to spice things up and again draw public attention) and paint a straw-man of Reddit traders being the sole force behind GME going up (and not a combination of Cohen coming in, general turnaround buying, naked-short selling squeeze as well as options gamma squeeze from WSB). Not only does the market listen to Citron in general, so some puts can finally go in-the-money (notice how the expiry of the contracts is tomorrow?), but it draws huge attention. **Their sole intention is to villify and demonise retail investors, and to squeeze every penny out of us as they can like they normally do**. The whole situation doesn't make sense from a logical point of view... Why would **Citron enter out of nowhere, shill for Melvin, consistently repeat that GME is going to $20, postpone their speech for \"inauguration\", get \"hacked by too many people\" and then a mysterious person buys puts at the same time as the announcement?**\n\nThe whole markets are watching now, Institutions vs Retail. Citron takes on all GME buyers. Surprisingly enough, having told OIP explicitly that we should not act like a coordinated group with the GME pushing unless we want something crazy to unfold (OIP passed the message to the senior mods), the very next day WSB makes a twitter account with inflammatory comments like \"**We are a force to be reckoned with\" \"We are taking over\" \"It's time for us to have a voice\"**. My source told me weirdly enough ahead of time that there would be some form of public contact/calling out between short-sellers and WSB. **He literally said their tactic was to draw WSB out explicitly, paint us as a collective single entity which coordinates trades and turn the public sentiment against us**. I literally told this to OIP exactly on the call, that the hedge-fund muscle (didn't know it was fucking Shitron then) were going to come out and attack WSB for the first time directly as a bunch of clueless traders and suckers. **Literally, everything unwound almost exactly as my source claimed they would**. This started happening slowly before but I only got the tip now about the full story. They were bleeding before, they got their buddy Cramer (who's admitted to openly manipulating markets) to push for a GME stock offering to give those gay shorts liquidity. \"Shore up the balance sheet\" and some BS. Constantly moving from side to side. The whole thing is completely off. As I consistently said to the mods in my messages (images), the twitter account plays right into their hands and it's basically doing their job for them. You couldn't get more explicit than saying that you're \"**taking over\"** a market and a \"**force to be reckoned with\"**. We couldn't be more explicit in trying to get the SEC to investigate the subreddit. Even if we did control the stock market, the worst thing you can do is write these things out explicitly on Twitter where the SEC are known (Hi Papa Elon) to be fucking strict.\n\n**My opinion**: Getting retail investors out of the game has been a goal of the financial establishment for some time. They cannot fathom that what was once a big boys only table has now been democratised into any autist with $100 can buy options and make money. Meme stocks made more money than the hedge funds last year. They want us out of the game. It's that simple. But don't worry, they'll probably put restrictions in the name of \"protecting unsophisticated retail investors from volatility\". They'll ban your options without owning the underlying (but keep an exception for authorised financial institutions) just like they lobbied to class CFDs as swaps and keep them out of US retail's hands (freedom my arse). Pattern day trader rules, hello? **In the future something is probably going to seriously wrong, and they'll pin it on \"the uneducated retail investors\".**\n\nTo preserve the future of this sub, we must not act like or even entertain the idea that we are an institution. Deepfuckingvalue made a really good call, and kudos to him. **But the whole GME situation has gone too far, and you know it has when Cramer, Shitron, Melvin and a ton of major news outlets are all hammering on about WSB and GME**. **Not acting like an institution extends to not having a Twitter account which \"speaks on behalf of WSB\"**. There's bull gang, bear gang, cash gang, theta gang etc etc.\n\nFellow autists, I hope you can see this. As for the lead mods, please heed my warnings. As fun as it is crushing the institutions, they have much more power us retail investors. The SEC itself was founded by a fucking insider trader. **Only 1 person went to jail for the financial crisis but they sent a WSBer to jail for filing a false acquisition offer for Fitbit**. The game is rigged, always has been. Stick to meme stocks, go back to inversing each other to see who wins. Or post diamond in the rough DD which WSB is famed for. Thanks.\n\nHigh profiles do not help anyone, and it leads to things like this happening which threaten the very existence of our sub. **We may win the battle, but we will most definitely lose the war against these corrupt entities who bribe politicians to get bailed out when they fuck up, make laws to ruin their competition, manipulate markets for their own gain and have a chummy, revolving door with the SEC.**\n\nCitron, Cramer, Melvin. Fuck you. You guys are the true scum of the earth. I don't care that you're short GME, I care that you're taking part in collusion, market manipulation via naked shorting, and the intentional villification of small time day traders.\n\nJust like in 2008, you're coming up with bullshit and trying to sell it as AAA. Just like you villified the poor people and immigrants for taking home loans instead of the people like yourselves who committed securities fraud, you're villifying the small retail trader trying to make some money in a period of massive job losses whilst you continue to manipulate markets as you've done for decades and keep minting money.\n\n[u/zjz](https://www.reddit.com/u/zjz/) [u/OPINION\\_IS\\_UNPOPULAR](https://www.reddit.com/u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR/) [u/ITradeBaconFutures](https://www.reddit.com/u/ITradeBaconFutures/)\n\nMy phone just died but imagine seeing the obligatory rockets,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nTendy Capital\n\nEDIT: Holyyy I've never got any awards ever.
