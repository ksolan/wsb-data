relic of last decade, Hold or buy GME calls of shares but have to be otm.\n\nToday was the most intense day i've ever watched gamestop and I have been invested since 17$ before Q3 but let me tell you fellow epic gmers and gorillas that this is only the beginning of the war between us and the shorts, but let me also say first that there is a massive amount of fud that we are not a collective and we are not all of one mind, but gorilla gamestop traders we are stronger together and the only thing we do collectively is diamond hand our calls and shares and teabagging melvin capital and mr.lemon now that we have alot of attention outside actors will try and disunite us, they will try to take our attention away from the prize which is 2000$ PT which i believe is in the realm of 5-10% percent possibility\n\nCALL HOLDERS GORILLAS here is what you do \n\nif you have FD's or Regular Monthly calls your are not doing anything wrong, however you are taking alot more risk than usual but you are moving the stock more than share holders simply because of delta and gamma hedging, if your option is expiring soon or you want to buy calls the most effective way to cause a gamma move is to buy otm with high deltas on the calls or exchanging a low delta itm call for a high delta otm say trading a 40$ strike for a 50$ warning this is highly risky but if every call gorilla does it then it will cause massive delta hedging and trigger big moves\n\nSHARE HOLDER GORILLAS\nyou are the frontline soldiers but while your risk is very low your impact is directly based on how much money you can put up in a cash account, while call holders are able to control more shares with large buys you are the backbone to Operation Liftoff, without your holding we would'nt have such low volume which is key to such big moves like EOD 30-33 1/21/2021\n\nRemember the Thesis/Battleplan\n\nGamestop is valued at 80-100$ alone if based on holiday console sales considering that there were more shares available at previous junctions and the supply for consoles is incredibly low so you are seeing a long term sales outlook, this in addition to the fucking collectibiles market is insane no joke my friend bought a entire wall of pop dolls, gaming collectibles about warhammer and even vr headsets all from you guessed it gamestop, this isn't some comic bookstore or place where yu gi oh tournaments are played this a full fledged  specialty retailer with a commanding presence in the market, Also the differences between gamestop and blockbuster are like no other and frankly its bold faced lying to compare the two, for one you are buying to own entertainment at gamestop, disks that can be used on multiple consoles and traded with different people, while blockbuster had a entire business model on rental retail, also when you were at the mall as a teen and kid did you and your friends go to hot topic first unless you were a emo kid, no you and your gaming obsessed friends stopped by gamestop every single fucking time.\n\nMy final point \nThe Dead Mall Boogeyman \nthis point that numerous investors use to base their shorts on retail is a fucking point from the last decade, news alert analysts we are in 2021 and we have been 12 years since the recession and the collapse of mallotopia that now all the dead weight loss has been most of all gone, with most malls being refinanced and new customers like the growing immigrant population, I live in a majority latino region and the amount of people i see at malls has grown every year since 2016, so the Dead mall thesis is incredibly lazy because it has already passed and dones its turn. \n\nWhat changed my mind was because i was massively short on build a bear workshop but i kept getting fucking smashed on it because the stock kept resisting going bankrupt it wasn't until i was out with my tinder date and she told me she bought 30 build a bears for her sister that i was like wtf are these people and thats where i learned that retail and the dead mall thesis is no longer valid past 2018 which in the end is why i put my entire account in daddy cohen's hands\n\nIn conclusion Hold my fellow epic Gmers and will see pluto soon\n\nWallstreetbets astronaut John Glenn\n\nEDIT:
