If you take investment advice from someone on the internet you should rethink shit a bit\n\nI wrote a comment today (pasted below the rocket ship horizontal rule) -- but people said I should make a post out of it. I don't give a fuck what you think about it, do with it what you will.\n\n**TLDR:** GME\ud83d\ude80 bears r fuk\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udc8e\u270b\ud83d\udc8e  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udc8e\u270b\ud83d\udc8e\n\n**The questions you should be asking...**\n\nPeople have left out all the fund traded shares that are owned (likely locked into place unless it moons and they have to rebalance). You're leaving out all the synthetic shares floating out around because of the shorts, and the facts the institutions or their allies are front running those shorts likely. Citron has also ignited a fight with some funds that have a bone to pick.\n\nYou're leaving out that the shorts also ARE NOT GETTING DELIVERED. Just because a broker has the shares on their books to short does NOT mean those shares are delivered.\n\nHow do I know? [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)\n\nGameStop's been on it far too long.\n\nBut brokers don't give a fuck, because SEC doesn't give enough of a fuck to do anything about it. They also don't give a FUCK about you. They only give a fuck with someone that matters enough does something wrong enough that someone else who matters enough gets hurt. Why did Elon get charged? There were a few institutions betting against it, remember?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Questions for you**\n\nHave you checked institutional inflow estimates? Have you checked L2 aggregated orders? Have you peeked at the bulk order flows?\n\nDo you actually have any idea how fucked the shorts are? Because if you did, you'd second mortgage your fucking house and put it on the line (do **NOT** do this you fucking idiot, it's a figure of speech).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**General thesis as of today:**\n\n* Institutions are fighting each other, not just us\n* Enough people have enemies within Wall Street, they're willing to pad their bottom lines after a year like we've had if the risk is minimal and greater for the other side (because one side has to give in first, humans can only take so much punishment)\n* Citron is obviously, blatantly manipulating the stock via the methods I describe below (note, today there were shares available to be loaned, and right before his stream, there was a massive short attack and then VIOLA there were no more shares to borrow. I don't know if this is coordinated with institutions, but the fuckers only worth $5M, he doesn't have the money to do what is going on by himself. **It could easily be algorithms just picking up news** on the wire and inappropriately acting on it.\n* Institutional inflows, bulk orders, and dark pools allow the type of wars we're watching (explained below)\n* I think there's just general interest in the stock, the added upside is that Citron and Melvin get fucked in the process of us owning a revolutionary gaming company\n* Cohen is going to change things, and hopefully he goes on Benzinga tomorrow to give commentary\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udc8e\u270b\ud83d\udc8e  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udc8e\u270b\ud83d\udc8e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**On how the volume is behaving and what is going on likely:**\n\nAs far as institutional inflows those and bulk order flows sometimes go together. Also, some dark pools aggregate their orders so what looks like a bunch of 1000, 500, 250, 50, 90, 110 share lots when people are selling are actually a single lot of 2000 etc.\n\nThese dark pools are used as back channels for some private funds that have broker access to the street, and help to disguise institutional movements mostly for hedge funds and speculative funds.\n\nBy looking at inflow estimate reports (you have to be in the industry to get access to most of this, it comes from extremely expensive research firms that brokers pay, or they have a team in house doing it) along with bulk orders, and trying to match those to the T&S tape ticker, you can start to see perhaps who is moving what.\n\nIf someone transacts let's say, 1M shares, and you can attribute it to a single individual somehow (if the pool didn't aggregate their order into another order to mix it into the execution cycle which normally they do to try and hide it) you can get an idea of what the true tradeable float is (if you don't get why, it's because you don't buy a million shares of something to day trade it, those are sitting at home for awhile, a long while).\n\nThose institutions buying those shares will let the price fall, then throw 50-100k of their shares through. You don't just execute a buy or sell of 1M shares @ $40, it's a thousand here, thousand there and the algo tries to get you the best price possible. Often you'll see dips, massive buy spikes, then buy/sell walls go up at price points where their average is to try and build a retail base also. Considering originally there was a low percentage of outstanding shares traded per day, building that base will take time because institutional ownership is so huge. Once that is built, they just have to counter act any shorts, and see even 50 basis point increase in volume could set this entire thing off.\n\nThose short attacks will stop once the shorts get out of their position but the base will remain and the hunger for the shares will remain. If the short float falls a bit, it actually will help us believe it or not, because the people that are going to get fucked here aren't the institutional traders - it's the big retail whales and 9 figure individuals betting against this. The big firms are already hedged, I promise you.\n\nWith the short volume being met by institutional buying volume, I estimate the actual float to be much, much, much smaller than the numbers we're seeing. Institutional ownership is over 100% -- this is ONLY possible by buying synthetic shares that are shorted.\n\nAll of this combined shows me that we have firms going at each other. A couple retail whales come in and upset that balance of power, and we're going to see this thing rip upwards. What you're likely seeing is firms day trading calls on swings (yes, calls, not puts) and forcing those swings to help them profit some, then cover some of their shares and slowly reduce the delta of their positions. They're not trading puts because that just exaggerates their delta, they trade the calls in case the thing fucking flies to the moon, their losses are capped as it sits now, and they're likely trading portions of their share position. 10% at a time, and if they have enough capital, they can drag this fight out for a long fucking time. There's no benefit for them to unwind all at once, it could set this thing into the stratosphere. It's potentially possible many of them have various dated $20 calls to help cover their short (and by possible, I mean likely, because the algos probably hedged as soon as it saw the price/volume explode when it moved off the $20 mark and identified the possible buttfucking their short position was about to give them) and they're just slamming volume around trying to create volatility because that's the best for the people writing the options (them and their friends). For all we know, some of these shorts are completely hedged just building it up to profit off the squeeze. If the shares rip up once they get out of the position, they don't care, because they'll hold to expiration for hedge, exercise, take the gains, and tank the stock again and short it on the way down while hedging the upside again. If the stock goes down, they can dump the calls and just let their short ride back down a ways. The calls are their cap -- similar to people buying a debit spread instead of long calls.\n\nBut with Melvin's puts likely expired and not re-upped in any identifiable way, that means we know one guy is really under the heat and already way fucking down on his position, which causes desperation. Humans can only take so much. Match that up with Citron's extreme fucking failures over the course of the last two years, we got a couple guys with reputations and millions on the line.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# FOR THE NOOBS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ELI5**\n\nGME\ud83d\ude80 bears r fuk\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **When is the short squeeze going to happen?**\n\nI have no idea when. Whenever the institutions are happy with their positions, probably.\n\nDays to cover means shit, for every person that covers, at this point, someone else is going to take their spot because enough firms think that it's going down and they would love that because they want a better entry on the long term. Believe it or not, regardless of Credit Suisse's way off price target, there's numerous VC firms and big whales looking at this right now wondering if WSB got something right, and if they understand the industry better. Most these guys don't understand gaming, it's a new, growing industry.\n\nThe catch is that someone has to be the first one to jump, like cliff diving into water you don't know the depth of. If one firm jumps, others may join. But if they jump and are wrong, they're tied into that investment and can't be non-directional if they're making an investment based play since that would be bad to suppress price for the company they're invested in and a violation of fiduciary responsibility.\n\nThis is part of the reason that long term, we could benefit from a pullback. Let some of the assholes off the hook so the real price can be determined by the market.\n\nI used to post DD and stock picks on here under another name. I may start again soon, I stopped for personal reasons and deleted that account, that was almost 2 years ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Meta: How do I learn to be good at trading?**\n\nLearn the market first, learn how to trade without any of the finance knowledge. This knowledge really doesn't help me trade all that much, it helps me understand why I win or lose, but knowing how to pick entries/exits and how to control my emotions is the best thing I've learned although I'm unhinged on Melvin and Citron\n\nHow I Made $2M In The Stock Market by Nicholas Darvas, then review Bill O Neill's shit with a grain of salt, don't follow CANSLIM to the T, but some of the ideas are sound like how to identify growth companies.\n\nAfter that, mess around trading shares and just make a goal to profit. If you're down, analyze the position and thesis and decide if you will get a profitable spot later, if so, learn discipline and hold. If not, cut it loose and start another trade.\n\nDo it about 50,000 times over 10,000 hours and you'll get good at it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***In Conclusion:*** If you're in the industry, you have access to shit others don't (not implying I am, or how I know these things). You should be able to watch a price/volume chart during the day and instantly identify institutional activity.\n\nFuck Melvin and Fuck Andrew Left and Shitron. It's one thing to be in a firm and short a stock for fundamental reasons. It's a whole other thing to let your ego get in the way after you drove the price down to $3 and go for the jugular just to make yourself feel better. The guy deserves the fucking $200-$300M loss he's about to eat at the current price, probably more considering the options he had expired and he's likely got some other hedges in place that won't work out for him.\n\nThis isn't to flex knowledge, it's to tell people you should be careful just spreading info around this board and getting people on board with a thesis. We're all mostly right on the idea that there's a squeeze coming, but it isn't for the reasons that we're saying.\n\n**The mania around here now has the public viewing us as some goddamn conglomerate pump and dump scheme. That shit has to stop. We're just dudes with small accounts compared to the real big fish, and we believe in $GME.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SECOND DISCLAIMER: This is all just my fucking opinion.
