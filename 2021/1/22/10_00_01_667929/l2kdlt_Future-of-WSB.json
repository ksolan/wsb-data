{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**I've been mainly lurking for a few years and in my opinion, there are currently a few issues regarding this subreddit:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* too much publicity\n\nWSB was originally a small community of autists wanting to make big gains with smart plays. Today WSB is more like an open discussion board, that's all over the news, and everyone can join and try to make some gains.  It's good to have a decent amount of players here but let's keep the information to ourselves and off the newspapers and CNBC. There is only a limited amount of gains to be made, let's keep the gains to ourselves and the boomers away. Also, what was the point of expanding to Twitter?\n\n* too many new wannabe autists\n\nWSB is on the frontpage of reddit like every other day with memes, and it attracts a lot of new members. Those new members aren't true autists and they clearly have hard time adjusting to our culture. This has caused attacking certain parties that we don't agree with, pump and dump schemes, lots of stupid posts and upvoting them, that nobody would have upvoted 6 months ago and so on. In general this is much more like a meme subreddit now, even when we are approaching the most important earnings week of the year. A good portion of the new members don't even understand the last sentence.\n\n* this isn't WallStreetMemes, this is WallStreetBets\n\nAnyone who's been here longer than 3 months, knows that we used to have much more useful posts or gain/loss porn in the frontpage of WSB, now it's mainly memes. It's fine to have memes here and there but most of them are just low quality karma farming memes and they get old real fast, unlike loss porn. I bet anyone who has been here longer than a year, would like to see people tattooing stupid shit, drinking piss, GUH their wife's boyfriend's savings away, and just see people act like the true autist they are, rather than these boring new memes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to fix this?**\n\n1. We had the rule for not allowing posts to be in r/all for like a whole 10 minutes back in the days, and I think we need that back. If someone is a true autist, they will find their way here regardless.\n2. Keep the WSB inside the WSB. No Twitter, no news, no sucking Cramer's dick to get to CNBC. We already have enough autists here to be a big player in financial markets. We don't need SEC to do us what your wife's boyfriend does to your wife.\n3. GME to the moon\n4. WSB needs to be kept under control. True autist never attacks anyone, we just troll people, make tendies and jerk to loss porn. It's pretty simple and if you can't accept it and follow the rules, you deserve to get banned.\n5. Let the new members become true autists, absorb our original culture, and I think WSB can be like it used to be. But if we constantly have a lot of new wannabe autists coming in, they are gonna take this sub over and there's nothing we can do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\npositions:\n\npronebone, 156 shares of TSLA, 80 shares of GME, lots of leap calls and smaller positions", "author_fullname": "t2_4l4iiaxw", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Future of WSB", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Discussion"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_l2kdlt", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 41, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 41, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1611337141.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>I&#39;ve been mainly lurking for a few years and in my opinion, there are currently a few issues regarding this subreddit:</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>too much publicity</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>WSB was originally a small community of autists wanting to make big gains with smart plays.
