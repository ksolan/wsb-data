This is not advice on what to do. If you have input your feedback is welcome.\n\n# Float deep dive\n\nPrevious DDs suggested that the violence of the squeeze depends on the ratio between shorted shares and available shares they can buy to cover. \n\nI wanted to understand exactly what this ratio is like right now and going into the squeeze. The purpose of this exercise for me was to gather data available on all holdings (institutions, insiders and mutual funds) to find out exactly how much float there is.\n\n## True float \n\nBefore looking at the data, let\u2019s talk about float vs true float. True float is a word I came up with to help myself understand how many shares are available for shorters to purchase.\n\nAs mentioned in previous DDs, each 1 share sold short creates another synthetic long share. This explains why the total shares in the market are larger than the number of shares issued by the company.\n\nThus, the true float = share float + synthetic longs from each short\n\n= share float + short interest = \\~117M\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at how much of that true float is available to trade. I\u2019ve compiled this sheet below to break down the holdings of insiders, mutual funds and institutional holdings. Note that this doesn\u2019t account for WSB holdings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gg7lm3zj1uc61.png?width=3356&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8c77a8a0b8e8cecef2ad754a04029d302fc52e3\n\n \n\n## Observations\n\n* Insiders and institutional holdings alone account for more than 100% of the company issued shares. \n   * In other words, the shorts simply cannot cover their shorts from the market alone. \n   * This is what previous DD\u2019s referred to as negative float.\n*  The share/float ratio currently is roughly 2.3:1\n\n# Why I don\u2019t think holding in cash vs margin makes much of a difference\n\nThe premise from previous DD\u2019s is that holding in cash accounts and not margin means shorters can no longer borrow the stocks to short further. This is absolutely correct. \n\nEssentially, my understanding is shorters can borrow any share from the \u201ctrue float\u201d  (including synthetic longs) to short sell it again. They can just keep shorting the stock forever pretty much if they have infinite money.\n\nEventually, some of those synthetic longs created by shorting will arrive in a \ud83d\udc8ehand cash account, which reduces the amount of borrowable shares from the true float.\n\nThus, available to short for shorters= True float - cash account \ud83d\udc8ehand shares.\n\nWhen the shares available to short are reduced, they become hard to borrow and brokers raise borrow rates on them. This makes shorters bleed faster.\n\nWhile I agree that holding in cash account makes shorters bleed faster, I don\u2019t think it makes a difference in the eventual occurrence of the squeeze because:\n\n1. Shorters don\u2019t have infinite money to keep shorting it forever. \n2. I\u2019d expect brokers would raise borrow rates regardless of borrow availability since shorting a fast climbing stock has a high risk and the stock is climbing very fast.\n3. It\u2019s obvious that the sentiment is shifting very positively in the favor of GME. Anyone trying to short it further at this point is playing with fire and risking bankruptcy.\n4. Once the squeeze starts, it should get very violent. Shorting this stock during it\u2019s squeeze sounds like suicide so I\u2019m speculating no new shorts will be open during the squeeze until news of an offering or something comes out.\n\nIn other words, buying on margin seems equally good to me if you\u2019re considering it. But if you can keep your shares in cash, go for it as it may bleed the shorters sooner rather than later.\n\n# Why I think VW-like MOASS is still likely to happen even though the current short:float ratio is not like VW\n\nThe short:float ratio is not constant.\n\nSince insiders, institutions and mutual funds hold over 100% of the float, it seems to be the case that the entirety of our shares are synthetic longs created due to shorts.\n\nAs shorts cover, synthetic long shares disappear from the market. As the true float grows smaller, the ratio between the remaining shorts needed to cover and the remaining float will change.\n\nTo imagine this, I created a chart to try to visualize what happens to the short/float ratio during the squeeze for different possibilities of days to cover.\n\nSince it\u2019s hard for me to predict how many shorts will cover exactly each day, I made some basic assumptions:\n\n* Let\u2019s assume that for D days to cover, each day will see (SI / D) shorts covered. In other words, the shorts will be covered evenly over the days to cover.\n   * This probably isn\u2019t very accurate. In reality I expect the shorts covered to start small then increase dramatically each day due to margin calls.\n   * If anything, I\u2019d imagine this means reality should be more violent than this chart.\n* Let\u2019s assume insiders and institutions will sell 20% of their holdings prior to or during the squeeze\n   * 20% makes it more of a worst case scenario.\n   * I see how it makes sense to think that insiders and institutional holders would want to take advantage of the situation and sell more.\n   * However, if those people have anything close to even a fresh grad intern working on this, they should understand that by holding longer they are creating fortunes for themselves.\n* Let\u2019s assume no new short positions will be opened during the squeeze\n   * This seems straightforward. Can you imagine someone shorting VW during its squeeze? They would be out of their mind. \n   * Even if someone is that crazy, I\u2019d expect brokers would have skyrocketing fees.\n\nFollowing the above assumptions, I created the following tables. Each table represents the outstanding SI, the available to trade float, and short:available ratio respectively.\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4p2nto0l1uc61.png?width=1722&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b58a7770b8400535893a705c3f4053998596c03\n\n \n\nTo visualize the data above, let\u2019s put it on a chart. Y axis is short:float ratio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c7smltol1uc61.png?width=1717&format=png&auto=webp&s=973c78faae78a78f0e1ae64fc34a12a7e33b1b05\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nObservations\n\n1. The short:float ratio becomes somewhat exponential as time passes due to supply shortage.\n   1. NOTE: It looks like the lines end early at small values. Don't fret, this simply means there are no shares available anymore after this day, aka the line tends to infinity.\n2. The squeeze becomes way more violent, more violent than VW, on later days (especially past 2-3 days) for all of different hypothetical values of days to cover.\n3. In all scenarios, there will become a point at which there are simply no shares available (negative) for short positions to purchase to cover.\n\nPoint (3) here is what makes this squeeze an infinity squeeze like a previous DD called it. Essentially, at this point remaining short positions are at the mercy of insiders, institutions, mutual funds or a company offering. Heck, even the offering of $100M may not be enough shares to cover the remaining short positions when the price skyrockets.\n\nI\u2019m just a retard trying to wrap my head around this to arrive at this observation. However it\u2019s safe to assume all of the above entities should be completely aware of this situation and the possibility of an infinity squeeze. I don\u2019t see why they wouldn\u2019t want to take advantage of this situation to name their price. Institutions could sell out and make deals with Melvin and shorters but they would be acting against their self interest; I'm assuming they can just get paid by brokers even if Melvin et al. go bankrupt.\n\nMy conclusion - \n\nThe infinity squeeze is somewhat inevitable. It may likely start small. Once it starts, it will keep getting more violent each day. If shorts start covering and the stock skyrockets, chances are it will skyrocket aggressively further each day for the next 2-3 days until institutional holdings sell or the company announces an offering which seem unlikely to start early.\n\nPositions: \\~8,000 shares, no limit orders set. Company fair value in my book is >$100 without a squeeze.\n\nObligatory:

Y axis is short:float ratio.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c7smltol1uc61.png?width=1717&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=973c78faae78a78f0e1ae64fc34a12a7e33b1b05\">https://preview.redd.it/c7smltol1uc61.png?width=1717&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=973c78faae78a78f0e1ae64fc34a12a7e33b1b05</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Observations</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The short:float ratio becomes somewhat exponential as time passes due to supply shortage.\n\n<ol>\n<li>NOTE: It looks like the lines end early at small values. Don&#39;t fret, this simply means there are no shares available anymore after this day, aka the line tends to infinity.</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>The squeeze becomes way more violent, more violent than VW, on later days (especially past 2-3 days) for all of different hypothetical values of days to cover.</li>\n<li>In all scenarios, there will become a point at which there are simply no shares available (negative) for short positions to purchase to cover.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Point (3) here is what makes this squeeze an infinity squeeze like a previous DD called it. Essentially, at this point remaining short positions are at the mercy of insiders, institutions, mutual funds or a company offering. Heck, even the offering of $100M may not be enough shares to cover the remaining short positions when the price skyrockets.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m just a retard trying to wrap my head around this to arrive at this observation. However it\u2019s safe to assume all of the above entities should be completely aware of this situation and the possibility of an infinity squeeze. I don\u2019t see why they wouldn\u2019t want to take advantage of this situation to name their price. Institutions could sell out and make deals with Melvin and shorters but they would be acting against their self interest; I&#39;m assuming they can just get paid by brokers even if Melvin et al. go bankrupt.</p>\n\n<p>My conclusion - </p>\n\n<p>The infinity squeeze is somewhat inevitable. It may likely start small. Once it starts, it will keep getting more violent each day. If shorts start covering and the stock skyrockets, chances are it will skyrocket aggressively further each day for the next 2-3 days until institutional holdings sell or the company announces an offering which seem unlikely to start early.</p>\n\n<p>Positions: ~8,000 shares, no limit orders set. Company fair value in my book is &gt;$100 without a squeeze.</p>\n\n<p>Obligatory: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "coin_price": 30, "id": "award_b4ff447e-05a5-42dc-9002-63568807cfe6", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "PREMIUM", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Illuminati_512.png", "days_of_premium": 0, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Illuminati_512.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Illuminati_512.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Illuminati_512.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Illuminati_512.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Illuminati_512.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "A glowing commendation for all to see", "end_date": null, "subreddit_coin_reward": 0, "count": 2, "static_icon_height": 2048, "name": "All-Seeing Upvote", "resized_static_icons": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it?width=16&height=16&auto=webp&s=d88c9a453f8ac38850b7a8241cfe5804b7b4905d", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it?width=32&height=32&auto=webp&s=96a25019eb75878bdec4f6c012540f3baffbb1b2", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it?width=48&height=48&auto=webp&s=1a51d27d75afde3fbde8bba84f9338f511211461", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it?width=64&height=64&auto=webp&s=96af5ec460b05669ed60224cb0619bb8884abe27", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it?width=128&height=128&auto=webp&s=2d3e648ed2302e6258673051ca5291f57beb29d4", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_format": "APNG", "icon_height": 2048, "penny_price": null, "award_type": "global", "static_icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Illuminati_512.png"}, {"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "coin_price": 150, "id": "award_f44611f1-b89e-46dc-97fe-892280b13b82", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png", "days_of_premium": 0, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=16&height=16&auto=webp&s=a5662dfbdb402bf67866c050aa76c31c147c2f45", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=32&height=32&auto=webp&s=a6882eb3f380e8e88009789f4d0072e17b8c59f1", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=48&height=48&auto=webp&s=e50064b090879e8a0b55e433f6ee61d5cb5fbe1d", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=64&height=64&auto=webp&s=8e5bb2e76683cb6b161830bcdd9642049d6adc11", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=128&height=128&auto=webp&s=eda4a9246f95f42ee6940cc0ec65306fd20de878", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Thank you stranger.
