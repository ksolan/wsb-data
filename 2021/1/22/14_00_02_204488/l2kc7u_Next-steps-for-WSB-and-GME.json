{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Hello there fellow degenerates, seen as we successfully shafted shitron I feel like it's time for a post to discuss this sub's true potential. A lot of us are absolute autists who scream reeeeeeee when we hear Mr Andrew 'cuckhold' (as his wife calls him) Left and order him pizzas or make tinder accounts for him (poor fucker won't be getting action any other way but please don't keep doing this). However the success of this sub is down to a couple of things:\n\n1. How diverse the audience is, we have VC, boomer general Jim Cramer, bankers, yolo artists, lawyers, engineers, astrophysists, doctors (helo lol) and the true heros those wendy's employees who're making the major returns from diving dickfirst into every DD with  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. This means we have serious power in influencing the market, not just because there are 1.9m of us, a lot of people don't follow the page and the true autists amongst us didn't just throw our student loans into GME, they got their friends to as well. So I believe as mentioned previously by some huge nerd we're probably acting as a MM when we work together.\n2. Big firms know about the impact WSB has, and some of the intelligent ones will join us for the ride, more will join in the future. This means soon dumping your load into the most mentioned ticker on this sub will almost guarantee you gains.\n3. GME is the first real test of whether we can turn a stock around in value mostly on our own as retail investors, because most boomers don't see any potential here, if we do get this fucker to $100+ they'll shit their pants and take notice for sure. Imagine seeing the most mentioned WSB tickers on Mad Money lol.\n4. We need to continue holding GME and continue to buy MORE, this is the only way the price of GME doesn't fall to 30s, and if it gets to low 30's there's a risk of paper handed motherfuckers wiping their ass with the stock. This means that WSB will lose it's market influence and shitron can say they're right for once.\n5. What most of the boomers seem to forget is that the market stays irrational for way longer than they realise. They stick to stats, which may help you get a modest return in a year but major gains are caused by irrational behaviour and logic. There's no exact science here, there'll always be a probability you'll lose due to irrational moves in the stock, what WSB has done is become that irrational move so the boomers are pissed.\n6. DON'T get influenced by the paid off media, half the articles you read are sponsored by the shorts, they are shitting themselves HARD. We pushed GME up 10% even when shitron tried to make his cuckhold argument against GME. They're trying their best to manipulate the market i.e. us so that we stay poor af. Fuck. The. Boomers. They've been pouring capital into trying to convince us to paper hands but all we need is one tweet of a fucking nut by RC and the stock jumps.\n7. EDIT: Having been caught up on the nightly drama, please don't post how great WSB is on social media, keep it to this reddit. If we want to make tendies for months or hopefully years to come then we've got to keep our shitposting to this subreddit, we're at a tipping point people. That being said I think it'd be quite hard to stamp us out, even if the SEC tries shutting the subreddit down, which I don't think is probable (hopefully).\n\nHOLD GME TILL DEATH \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 We will be going to the moon lads.
