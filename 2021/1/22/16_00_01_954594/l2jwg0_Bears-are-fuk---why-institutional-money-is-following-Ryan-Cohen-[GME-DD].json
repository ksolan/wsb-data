{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Yes, we do need another DD on Gamestop. I will take a look at the biggest institutional inflows and outflows into Gamestop and ~~reason myself into bullish confirmation bias~~ explain why objectively the buyers are right and the sellers are fuk.\n\nYou can also see my full DD with charts and images and emojis and shit in this PowerPoint, *yes there is a Powerpoint, DID I STUTTER?:* [*https://docdro.id/zbMjIJk*](https://docdro.id/zbMjIJk)\n\nThis DD is concerned with **institutional investments** in Gamestop. Why do we care about institutional investors?\n\n1. They can greatly influence the price with big buy or sell orders\n2. They often have longer holding periods than WSB autists. If many institutions hold Gamestop, it reduces the actively traded float and increases the probability of a short squeeze.\n3. Institutional buy-in means support for the fundamental value of Gamestop and confidence in their turnaround.\n\n**Tl;dr:** Lots of institutions IMMEDIATELY but quietly made big bets on Gamestop after Ryan Cohen made his first investment. I believe these inflows will continue as his influence on the company grows. While many institutions also exited Gamestop in the past months, due to the timing of their sales I believe these were panic sells that were made prematurely.\n\n***Even more tl;dr:*** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc02\ud83d\udc02\ud83d\udc02\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6,** but you really might need to hold for quite a few months to see big gains.\n\nThis post talks about three different issues:\n\n1. Gamestop\u2019s situation in Summer 2020, and how Ryan Cohen swooped in to save the day.\n2. How different institutions reacted to Ryan Cohen\u2019s investment\n3. Why the bullish institutions were right, and the bearish ones were wrong\n\n**Part 1: Initial situation in summer of 2020**\n\nThings were looking real dire for Gamestop just a couple of months ago.\n\n[-91&#37; return in 5 years, nice](https://preview.redd.it/ejlho2zamuc61.png?width=1846&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3d0686cb7459d56d881f43865474489f5be60b)\n\nThe price was on a consistent slide. Sentiment was absolutely terrible. A dying brick and mortar company. Going short was a sure thing. Then, Covid and retail closures. Bear thesis totally confirmed, right? Right?\n\nIn swoops Ryan Cohen and sneakily accumulates 5% of the company. We all know what happened to the share price after.\n\n[Look at that erection](https://preview.redd.it/u5i7k2oemuc61.png?width=1517&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5a99e455105e7cd1d6cd85c12d65afbdb225e6f)\n\nThis DD is mainly concerned with institutional money flows in Q3 2020 - who bought and who sold, and what can we conclude from that?\n\n**Part 2: How different institutions reacted in Q3**\n\nNow sadly reporting takes a long time so we only know what movements funds made up until September 30, 2020. But that gives us a glimpse into what funds did in the same quarter in which Ryan Cohen bought in.\n\nIn that quarter, institutions ***bought*** 22m shares of Gamestop and ***sold*** 13m. A few big names were involved both in the selling and the buying.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/62lu32fimuc61.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=234024c1e51099af1c098c4e556f6b788512e45d\n\n\"But drunkiez\", you say \"why do I care? So some institutions sold and some bought? How does this info help me go to Mars?\" Read on my child.\n\n**Part 3: Why the bulls were right**\n\nThe relevant info here is ***timing***. If we just look at the the Top 10 funds with the biggest Gamestop inflows in Q3 2020, 7 of those opened completely ***new*** positions once they heard about Cohen's first investment. The other 3 increased their share count by ***200-900%!*** They realized immediately that the narrative would shift completely - Gamestop would no longer be seen as a dying retailer, but had a long-term chance for a new future. These guys are in it for the long haul. Companies like Morgan Stanley and Susquehanna hold their positions for an average of 20-40 quarters. The average WSB tard can't even hold for 20-40 minutes.\n\n[Institutions are loving this turnaround story](https://preview.redd.it/jg1zasbnnuc61.png?width=1148&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf69d9a1a36ee3c4fbd55ffed3e9447c069d4079)\n\nNow what about the poopoo bears?\n\nWe can see that many big institutions like Blackrock also exited in Q3 2020. These funds also have long holding periods. In fact, you can see in the chart below that the Top 10 bearish institutions had nearly **unchanged share holdings** since at least September 2019, and suddenly panic sold at the height of the Covid panic, right before they heard about Cohen's involvement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The most bearish institutions bagheld for months and panic sold right before our lord came in](https://preview.redd.it/huityktkmuc61.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=0aa909d1a28f275276f9987580a769650fc3f684)\n\nActually, the truth is even worse then the chart shows. Many big dick funds started making bullish bets on Gamestop even before 2019. Yes, you read that right. Blackrock made a huge bullish bet in Q2 2018, bagheld for over two years, then panic sold weeks before Ryan Cohen got in. Citigroup kept accumulating in 2018 and 2019, then suddenly sold almost the entire stake at the very bottom. D.E. Shaw went all in at the beginning of 2019, and panic sold at the bottom. They all deserve to be mods on this sub. Do you really want to follow these people with your trades?\n\nWhat does this mean for the future? Sometime in February we will receive new filings on institutional purchases made in Q4 2020. I expect to see many more inflows as Ryan Cohen continued his commitment. Not to speak of Q1 2021, when he actually got operationally involved with 3 new board members. This turnaround story has only just begun.\n\n**Bonus: why it's a good idea to trust Ryan Cohen**\n\nA lot has been done to praise Ryan Cohen on this sub. If you want to understand why I'm bullish on anything he does, read this great DD by runningAndJumping22: [GME DD - Background and experience of new leadership](https://www.reddit.com/r/runningAndJumping22/comments/l1egkw/gme_dd_background_and_experience_of_new_leadership/)\n\nI just want to add one point to this: building a successful startup is HARD. Out of the companies that receive funding (which in itself is really hard to do), 9 out of 10 will go on to fail. But you know what increases your chances of building a successful company to almost 100%? **If you've already done it before**. You have the money, the network and the talent to do it again. Look what the founders of Paypal later accomplished: Tesla, Affirm, SpaceX, all of Peter Thiel's successes, Palantir, Youtube, Linkedin, etc. Very different companies, every single one of them a winner.\n\nVC funds will fall over themselves to give money to previously successful founders, because **they know they will have an almost 100% chance of succeeding again**. Ryan and his buddies have done it once, and they can do it again. It doesn't really matter to us how they do it. They could walk into any fund's office and easily collect tens of millions to start a new gaming e-commerce company. But they chose to do it with Gamestop. Not a bad idea in itself.\n\nIn my opinion, they could literally close every single store, sell all assets and use the net cash of USD 200m to build an ecommerce company from scratch (btw: Chewy, which ships 60 POUND HEAVY BAGS OF DOG FOOD only used USD 130m in capital investments while Ryan Cohen was there). But Gamestop does come with some good assets: a store base, a well-known name, partnerships, Reginald Fils Aime on the board, etc.\n\nOne hindrance is that the name Gamestop is poison on Wall Street. I know this point has been beaten to death lately, but I think it will take **several quarters of Cohen's involvement and operational changes** to truly change that, so you really shouldn't invest a ton of money if you're not willing to hold for that long. However, we can see that sentiment started changing almost immediately once Ryan Cohen got it, and I don't see that stopping anytime soon. Even without a short squeeze, this stock can go to the moon in the coming years.\n\n***tl;dr once more:***

If we just look at the the Top 10 funds with the biggest Gamestop inflows in Q3 2020, 7 of those opened completely <strong><em>new</em></strong> positions once they heard about Cohen&#39;s first investment. The other 3 increased their share count by <strong><em>200-900%!</em></strong> They realized immediately that the narrative would shift completely - Gamestop would no longer be seen as a dying retailer, but had a long-term chance for a new future. These guys are in it for the long haul. Companies like Morgan Stanley and Susquehanna hold their positions for an average of 20-40 quarters. The average WSB tard can&#39;t even hold for 20-40 minutes.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jg1zasbnnuc61.png?width=1148&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf69d9a1a36ee3c4fbd55ffed3e9447c069d4079\">Institutions are loving this turnaround story</a></p>\n\n<p>Now what about the poopoo bears?</p>\n\n<p>We can see that many big institutions like Blackrock also exited in Q3 2020. These funds also have long holding periods. In fact, you can see in the chart below that the Top 10 bearish institutions had nearly <strong>unchanged share holdings</strong> since at least September 2019, and suddenly panic sold at the height of the Covid panic, right before they heard about Cohen&#39;s involvement.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/huityktkmuc61.png?width=1472&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0aa909d1a28f275276f9987580a769650fc3f684\">The most bearish institutions bagheld for months and panic sold right before our lord came in</a></p>\n\n<p>Actually, the truth is even worse then the chart shows. Many big dick funds started making bullish bets on Gamestop even before 2019. Yes, you read that right. Blackrock made a huge bullish bet in Q2 2018, bagheld for over two years, then panic sold weeks before Ryan Cohen got in. Citigroup kept accumulating in 2018 and 2019, then suddenly sold almost the entire stake at the very bottom. D.E. Shaw went all in at the beginning of 2019, and panic sold at the bottom. They all deserve to be mods on this sub. Do you really want to follow these people with your trades?</p>\n\n<p>What does this mean for the future? Sometime in February we will receive new filings on institutional purchases made in Q4 2020. I expect to see many more inflows as Ryan Cohen continued his commitment. Not to speak of Q1 2021, when he actually got operationally involved with 3 new board members. This turnaround story has only just begun.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bonus: why it&#39;s a good idea to trust Ryan Cohen</strong></p>\n\n<p>A lot has been done to praise Ryan Cohen on this sub. If you want to understand why I&#39;m bullish on anything he does, read this great DD by runningAndJumping22: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/runningAndJumping22/comments/l1egkw/gme_dd_background_and_experience_of_new_leadership/\">GME DD - Background and experience of new leadership</a></p>\n\n<p>I just want to add one point to this: building a successful startup is HARD. Out of the companies that receive funding (which in itself is really hard to do), 9 out of 10 will go on to fail. But you know what increases your chances of building a successful company to almost 100%? <strong>If you&#39;ve already done it before</strong>. You have the money, the network and the talent to do it again. Look what the founders of Paypal later accomplished: Tesla, Affirm, SpaceX, all of Peter Thiel&#39;s successes, Palantir, Youtube, Linkedin, etc. Very different companies, every single one of them a winner.</p>\n\n<p>VC funds will fall over themselves to give money to previously successful founders, because <strong>they know they will have an almost 100% chance of succeeding again</strong>. Ryan and his buddies have done it once, and they can do it again. It doesn&#39;t really matter to us how they do it. They could walk into any fund&#39;s office and easily collect tens of millions to start a new gaming e-commerce company. But they chose to do it with Gamestop. Not a bad idea in itself.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, they could literally close every single store, sell all assets and use the net cash of USD 200m to build an ecommerce company from scratch (btw: Chewy, which ships 60 POUND HEAVY BAGS OF DOG FOOD only used USD 130m in capital investments while Ryan Cohen was there). But Gamestop does come with some good assets: a store base, a well-known name, partnerships, Reginald Fils Aime on the board, etc.</p>\n\n<p>One hindrance is that the name Gamestop is poison on Wall Street. I know this point has been beaten to death lately, but I think it will take <strong>several quarters of Cohen&#39;s involvement and operational changes</strong> to truly change that, so you really shouldn&#39;t invest a ton of money if you&#39;re not willing to hold for that long. However, we can see that sentiment started changing almost immediately once Ryan Cohen got it, and I don&#39;t see that stopping anytime soon. Even without a short squeeze, this stock can go to the moon in the coming years.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>tl;dr once more:</em></strong>
