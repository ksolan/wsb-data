{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**TLDR: I think Market Makers got completely screwed today by this sub's unprecedented call buying yesterday. Expect some people to get fired. They normally can hedge their calls they sold you buying stock as price moves, but there wasn't supply for them to buy the 15m shares they needed in the 3 hour period this AM. I suspect MM's are going to be in the hole at least $100 million today, maybe more. And yeah, some people are getting fired.**\n\n**Bonus TDLR: You guys did it. By concentrating enough WSB autism in one point in the form of $60 call options, you created a previously unproven distortion of the fabric of vol/spot/time known as a Degenerity, where vol became price, green became red (for dealers) red became green (for option holders), bears like me get excited for bulls, and the market broke, spawning a wormhole new universe where GME is somehow above it's ATH, and spraying out a massive field distortion via degenerons, which are now being detected on CNBC.  It's like a black hole, but with options. I look forward to those with PhDs in physics and finance expanding upon this theory.**\n\nWell, if anyone hates market makers, today is your day. I'm 90% sure they got completely screwed.\n\nI don't think this is a short squeeze primarily. I think we are actually seeing a gamma squeeze in which dealers could not hedge as quickly as their short calls lost value, and citadel and other market makers are losing hundreds of millions today as a group, which almost never happens, especially at this scale.\n\nShorts don't HAVE to cover until there are 0 shares to borrow and they get bought in. They may get margin called before, but institutions diversify. And there are shares to borrow to an extent, rate still 22% on IB. I'm sure some of this happened, but you can't really force this until the many hundreds on a typical hedge fund book.\n\nOn the other hand, looking at options, OI went up a lot overnight - I sadly did not check this AM. You now have 80K calls expiring today at 55 to 60 bucks, then another 70k next week, and another maybe 50k at longer dates. That is what we call...  \ud83d\ude80 \u26fd\n\nThat's 200k, or 20m shares!!! To hedge that at 63+ you need... about 20m shares.  Of course, some are thetagang short options, so call it 15m shares. Keep in mind, dealers had 25-30m shares before this going into today, so they now want to hold 40-45m shares (on 110m sythethic float of loaned shares + real shares) \ud83d\ude80 \u26fd \ud83d\ude80 \u26fd \ud83d\ude80 \u26fd\n\nI think that when the ramp started around 55, dealers had to rush to buy shares, but could not get 15m shares between $50 and $60. I still think they need to buy more shares. So they are probably down 5-10m shares from what they need, which means they are losing $10m per dollar move in the price, and will pay any price to stop the bleeding. They basically oversold you guys calls yesterday and didn't risk manage. I'm sure some guys in their risk mgmt department are getting fired over this, as the writing was on the wall, and they still sold you guys calls - they should've been charging $10 a call yesterday to protect themselves, or offering much higher strikes to tempt money into that and away from over-concentrating at $60. I suspect when the dust settles, we will find out that the better market makers BOUGHT calls from other market makers, and would not be surprised if there's an 8-k from a market maker tonight about exceptional losses. You may actually bankrupt a small one. Because the mass of calls at $60 got so heavy, it became impossible to hedge dynamically.\n\nIn terms of gamma conditions ffom here, there's no remaining ramp, but there may be residual MM buy. They are likely buying your $60 calls to hedge themselves from more pain, so it should stabilize in a few hours since they'll pay anything to stop the bleeding. From there, it's a down ramp until gamma ramps re-built at higher prices.\n\nI have no idea where the price goes from here today. Conventionally, it should be selling because there's a lot of calls ITM rolling off, but MMs may be so damn underwater and in need of shares it may not happen, and they may not sell shares on calls sold to them as they may be underhedged. **If you think MMs are fully hedged, it's a bearish situation. If you think MMs are not fully hedged, it's a bullish situation. What is the case though is anyone who was long yesterday is definitely making big money today.**\n\nWow.\n\n**I'm a bear, but seriously, congrats bulls, you did break the market, but maybe not in the way you think you did. I really think the guys you screwed today were MMs... I have profound respect for what you did. Yes, my puts sucked, I'm down $35k all together on trying to play this one. You are welcome, you deserve it.**  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAnd I'm really dumb for not checking open interest this morning. Writing was on the wall due to all the calls you guys bought yesterday. It's infuriating when you know you could've seen it in plain sight and were too busy doing something else to check.\n\nI also think that the MMs are going to be careful about this moving forward and this kind of outcome will be unlikely to happen again. Then again, they usually make money on this sub so maybe not. Keep hope alive?\n\nAnother fun fact - $76.76 is an ATH for GME stock since the IPO in 2002. Prior was $62 I believe.\n\nAlso, wanted to link you guys Martin Shkreli's comments on the GME situation from YESTERDAY via people who have access to him I guess by phone (since he still has 2.5 years of federal prison left)?
