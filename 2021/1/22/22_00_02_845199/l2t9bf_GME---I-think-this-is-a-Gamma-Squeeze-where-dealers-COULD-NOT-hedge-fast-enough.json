Expect some people to get fired. They normally can hedge their calls they sold you buying stock as price moves, but there wasn't supply for them to buy the 15m shares they needed in the 3 hour period this AM, and realy, a good 8-10m of that need happened in a few minute period which was when the market broke. I suspect MM's are going to be in the hole $100-200 million today. And yeah, some people are getting fired. You guys did it - you made the Degenerity! GME hit an all time high price (but not all time high market cap)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Not a short squeeze:**\n\nI don't think this is a short squeeze primarily. I think we are actually seeing a gamma squeeze in which dealers could not hedge as quickly as their short calls lost value, and citadel and other market makers are losing hundreds of millions today as a group, which almost never happens, especially at this scale.\n\nShorts don't HAVE to cover until there are 0 shares to borrow and they get bought in. They may get margin called before, but institutions diversify. And there are shares to borrow to an extent, rate still 22% on IB. I'm sure some of this happened, but you can't really force this until the many hundreds on a typical hedge fund book.\n\nOn the other hand, looking at options, OI went up a lot overnight - I sadly did not check this AM. You now have 80K calls expiring today at 55 to 60 bucks, then another 70k next week, and another maybe 50k at longer dates. That is what we call...  \ud83d\ude80 \u26fd\n\nThat's 200k, or 20m shares!!! To hedge that at 63+ you need... about 20m shares.  Of course, some are thetagang short options, so call it 15m shares. Keep in mind, dealers had 25-30m shares before this going into today, so they now want to hold 40-45m shares (on 110m sythethic float of loaned shares + real shares) \ud83d\ude80 \u26fd \ud83d\ude80 \u26fd \ud83d\ude80 \u26fd\n\nWhen the ramp started around 55, dealers had to rush to buy shares, but could not get 15m shares between $50 and $60.  When it hit $60, there was a HUGE amount of options all at once, and market liquidity was insufficient (\"The Degenerity\"). At the writing of this post in the morning during the halt, it means they are losing $10m per dollar move in the price, and will pay any price to stop the bleeding. I'm sure some guys in their risk mgmt department are getting fired over this, as the writing was on the wall, and they still sold you guys calls - they should've been charging $10 a call yesterday to protect themselves, or offering much higher strikes to tempt money into that and away from over-concentrating at $60. I suspect when the dust settles, we will find out that the better market makers BOUGHT calls from other market makers, and would not be surprised if there's an 8-k from a market maker tonight about exceptional losses. You may actually bankrupt a small one. Because the mass of calls at $60 got so heavy, it became impossible to hedge in real time.\n\nIn terms of gamma conditions from here, there's no remaining real ramp once you are at around 63.\n\n**Edit #3: Previously said we would see stagnation right under $60 because dealers have an interest in a $60 close and probably own 40m+ shares at this point offsetting the huge short calls - and had to unload 6m shares in ITM calls ending today. But it looks like they either don't care or are losing control with this hot close at $64.75. Going to be a lot of share delivery into Monday, maybe as much as 10m.  That'll be interesting to sort out.**\n\n**I'm a bear, but seriously, congrats bulls, you did break the market, but maybe not in the way you think you did. I really think the guys you screwed today were MMs, probably on the order of $100-200m... I have profound respect for what you did. Yes, my puts sucked, I'm down $35k all together on trying to play this one.

Writing was on the wall due to all the calls you guys bought yesterday. It's infuriating when you know you could've seen it in plain sight and were too busy doing something else to check.\n\nI do think MMs will be more careful on this moving forward and make this less likely to repeat. This epic failure on their part is going to attract CIO level oversight. Unlike the meltup last Wednesday where they got to hedge smoothly, they were not able to hedge here.\n\nAlso, wanted to link you guys Martin Shkreli's comments on the GME situation from YESTERDAY via people who have access to him I guess by phone (since he still has about a year of federal prison left)?
