{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been a member of WSB for 5 years now. For you autists that will undoubtedly check my post history this isn\u2019t my only Reddit account. Back in the day, WSB had a certain culture (for lack of a better term) that has made it what it is today. That culture is the reason terms like autist, retard, gay bear, etc. are still being used. That culture is what made WSB a fun, light hearted place to talk shit with the boys and lose money. That culture is what brought millions of people to this sub and to the stock market in general.\n\nNow I haven\u2019t said anything about the newbies that ask the most retarded questions ever to have existed without taking 30 seconds to consult the google machine. I haven\u2019t said anything about the mods who are clearly more concerned with jacking each other off than maintaining this sub. However, the one thing I WILL say is the softness of these newcomers is ruining this sub. For example, some nurse came on here crying about making 24k a month after taxes during corona virus. I said to him \u201cYou deserve it and stay safe out there but also shut the fuck up and stop crying about making 24k after taxes\u201d. I thought it was a nice comment I told this guy to stay safe and he deserves his money which is more than I can say about half you retards. This guy writes paragraphs upon paragraphs crying some more and not acknowledging what sub he\u2019s in. Has the culture really changed that much? This is a regular occurrence with MANY new members of this sub and I don\u2019t blame the crying nurse for his ignorance of the subs culture. This has been happening little by little over time. Pretty soon people will be offended with autist or gay or whatever new slurs we come up with. \n\nI labeled this as a discussion because frankly I don\u2019t know what the fuck I\u2019m writing or what to flair this post. I don\u2019t want this sub to change and hate how these people don\u2019t understand my positivity when I call them smooth brained or dumb fucks or whatever else. How can we help newcomers understand and acclimate to the culture and language of this sub? Do we make them take a based test? Do we ban them if they get offended? Do we literally hold their dicks while they pee? Please let me know your thoughts in the comments.
