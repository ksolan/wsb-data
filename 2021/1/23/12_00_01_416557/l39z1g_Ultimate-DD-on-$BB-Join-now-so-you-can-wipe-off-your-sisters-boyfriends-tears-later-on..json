{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Listen up.. \u201cIf you think BB moon\u2019d after this week, you\u2019re a rough brained retard. Our astronauts John Chen and Tom Eacobacci are literally in the break room; Chen\u2019s unpacking some homemade Yangzouh Fried Rice from his wife, Tom is microwaving stale coffee and asking Chen if he\u2019s going to change his name to Cha Ching after he becomes a Billionaire in 2023. Chen smirks as he cracks open his wheel of fortune cookie... the point is, rocket is still fucking grounded. I repeat, the rocket is grounded.\n\nListen retards, did you miss AMD? Did you miss NVDA? Did you miss trash ass Cringecoin? Hell, did you even miss TSLA? Are you seething with FOMO up to your ears and out of your assholes watching these stocks mint fresh millennial millionaires while you twiddled your thumbs thinking \u201cGeE WiZ tHeY haVe To CoMe DoWn EveNtuAlLYyyyYyyYy\u201d\n\nPro tip: they never came down...\n\nThese rockets went to the fucking moon and left your ass behind on planet Earth, living a shitty wage life flipping burgers, while the retards that boarded these rockets are on the moon laying on beach chairs, sunglasses on, and rubbing sunscreen with SPF 9000 on their smooth brains because they got front row tickets to the sun... FRONT ROW TICKETS TO THE FUCKING, SUN... this is the present state of affairs.\n\nThere is, lucky you, however, another rocket with the inscription BBC fueling up and selling tickets to the moon AS WE SPEAK.\n\nCurrent position: missionary with 10,555 shares and reverse cowgirl with some calls. I\u2019m holding unrealized profits of about $110k and realized profits of about $100k.\n\nHowever, if you ask me 10 years from now my biggest regret in life... I will tell you two things: 1, not getting my wife her bf earlier on, and 2, booking $100k profit too soon in BB.\n\nMay Lord Chen forgive my moment of weakness. Learn from me. Buy and walk away. Buy and hold. Do not be tempted to sell before the moon. To not sell when the rocket is still in the stratosphere.\n\nMoon is $50 IF THE STOCK JUST TRADES ON PAR WITH ITS FUCKING PEERS, MOON CAN EASILY BE $100+ IF YOU FACTOR IN VERTICALS, ECONOMIC MOAT, and a $450-750 billion Auto Data Market as stated in Mckinsey & Company\u2019s report on Monetizing Auto Data. Yes that\u2019s not a mistake, the overall revenue pool from Global Auto Data monetization could be as high as $750 BILLION in 2030. This is the market BB has cornered and is about to squeeze by the balls. QNX was always the crown Jewel of all their verticals. This was always the master plan for the turnaround. We are on the fucking cusp of one of the greatest turnarounds in history.\n\nListen, I don\u2019t think some of you rough brained retards realize what is happening:\n\nAsk yourselves: why is the EV sector so hot? Why is every large tech corporation trying to get a piece of this Auto pie?\n\nYou wanna know why? Because when the computer first came out it took the space of entire fucking floors in a building to do simple calculations... when the cell phone first came out, you needed a fucking brief case just to carry it and looked like an absolute tool making a phone call, stopping everything you\u2019re doing, laying down your suitcase, opening it, taking out the brick, extending a massive antenna, LMFAO, what fucking tools boomers were... anyways, now look at the modern laptop and smartphone. Look at the revolutions these products went through to become cemented into our lives. Look at the markets these products opened up for us.\n\nNow, what current item is undergoing this type of revolution? You guessed it, you smooth brained criminal you, the Automobile. What was once dinosaur machinery unironically running on dead dinosaurs, is now making the revolution on the scale that computers and phones went through to become what they are today.\n\nAnd guess who created a business moat anticipating this move 10 years in advance? Guess who cemented their ISO SAFETY CERTIFIED AUTO OS into 175 million automobiles as of today, hint hint: it\u2019s the same company that\u2019s so criminally undervalued and just took on AWS as their partner to scale up their business for next phase of the turnaround: Revenue Growth.\n\nBlackberry. It\u2019s Blackberry. Babe berry. Member berry. The blacker the berry... the sweeter the juice boys.\n\n\u201cwhAt aBoUT GoOgLe aNd APpLe or TSLA TaKiNg OvEr the Auto OS mArKet\u201d\n\nListen retards, BlackBerry\u2019s MOAT is bullet proof. You know why?\n\nBecause what\u2019s the one thing Google, Apple, and TSLA have in common? They\u2019re actually in the fucking auto business.\n\nYou think Mercedes or Toyota wants to cede even more profit in the auto business to competitors by adopting their OS and giving them a boost? Do you know how cutthroat and ruthless the corporate world is?\n\nLet me demonstrate with the ol\u2019 lemonade stand analogy. Let\u2019s say you setup a lemonade stand outside your house and all the kids are going nuts for your lemonade. Next thing you know, Jimmy from next door opens a lemonade stand, and throws in a Jolly Rancher inside each lemonade he makes. You\u2019re fucked. Jimmy just took your business, your friends, your girl and her bf.\n\nYou need to level the playing field by adding Jolly Ranchers to your lemonade... so how will you do this? Are you gonna go up to Jimmy\u2019s stand and straight up buy Jolly Ranchers from your mortal enemy? Is that what a smooth brained person would do?\n\nNO, you would walk your ass down the street to a neutral third party convenient store, buy fucking Jolly Ranchers from them, and while you\u2019re at it, buy some cough syrup and add that as well to your lemonade. Because fuck Jimmy, that\u2019s why.\n\nSpeaking of lemonade...\n\n\u201cwHat iF ShiTrOn TaKeS a ShIT oN BB?\u201d\n\nAndrew Left although the gayest bear of them all, actually saw BB potential years ago calling it the next NVDA. He was early on that call, but he was right.\n\nBack to the lemonade moat:\n\nListen retards, Blackberry is not a competitor to any auto maker the same way Apple, Google, and TSLA are. You think auto makers are going to use their competitors OS? Or you think these non techy auto dinosaurs like Mercedes and Toyota are gonna reinvent the wheel and create their own OS. Fuck no. Don\u2019t be so rough brained and fall for that gay bear \u201cDD\u201d\n\nBlackBerry is a third party corporation that all auto makers can form an auto cartel around with Papa Chen as the cartel lord. A couple automakers MIGHT create their own OS because they\u2019re a fucking tech company to begin with, and they have the scale and reach to do so, but don\u2019t think for A FUCKING SECOND their competitors are gonna just line up to use it and cede more their profits to them. These other Auto OS (if made) will be specific and unique to that companies own car. Think. Use that smooth brain.\n\nBlackberry has effectively become the gate keeper of the Auto Data Market.\n\nAlso this is a tough fucking market. Cars are one of the most data rich endpoints in the world that need securing. This isn\u2019t like a laptop, you click the wrong link, and next thing you know you have a million Hentai pop ups. The car is more serious. You click the wrong link; and you\u2019re dead.\n\nAre you getting the picture now? Do you see why Cylance was bought? Do you see why BlackBerry\u2019s moat is so secure?\n\nCylance has just been integrated into QNX and was shown off at CES. How many of you missed that fine detail?\n\nNot only does QNX now act as the gatekeeper of all auto data, it fucking protects the super sensitive endpoints using AI driven cyber protection that gets better and better the more the data grows, which it will, exponentially.\n\nAutomakers are lined up like school boys on Easter Sunday ready for deliverance from Papa Chen as he blesses them with QNX.\n\nRemember when Chen said: \u201cwhen better days come, we\u2019ll be ready to execute\u201d\n\nBetter days are here. This is what he was talking about. They\u2019ve positioned and prepared themselves for 10 years to become the Auto Data Gatekeeper once the technology was ready. The foresight on Papa Chen... Absolute Genius.\u201d\n\nCredits fo the DD: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l37ktg/bb_weekend_due_diligence_confirmation_bias/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf", "author_fullname": "t2_10e82vf3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Ultimate DD on $BB\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\ude90 Join now so you can wipe off your sisters boyfriends tears later on.", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_l39z1g", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 73, "total_awards_received": 2, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 73, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\u001b210102:1:1"}], "gildings": {"gid_1": 2}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1611427400.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Listen up.. \u201cIf you think BB moon\u2019d after this week, you\u2019re a rough brained retard.
