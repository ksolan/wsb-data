Buy anything you can, you don\u2019t need to be a whale, you need to be an ant. Ever noticed how ants work together and carry big pieces of food? Well folks, we are all ants, some just bigger than others. Do your part, we break down walls, and we all feast together and can spread the wealth. \n\n\n\nAlright, I\u2019m going to include my original post from after we went private but couldn\u2019t post here...mainly because I\u2019m going to own up to what I said about BB and PLTR. I was wrong about it, however, the money put into those would\u2019ve still got more returns yesterday in GME and definitely going forward....\n\n\n#1. Children\u2019s Hospital\n\nCall up your local children\u2019s hospital, ask for the donations department and speak with them. \n\n#little story time\n\nI have a cousin who had major health problems when he was 9, he spent most of the year in the children\u2019s hospital. I spent many days taking care of my other cousin / his 8 year old brother when the parents were working. It wrecked havoc on their life, but nothing gets me more than seeing how it affected my cousins. \n\nThe one in the hospital would question if he would be \u201cnormal\u201d again. The other one that I would look after, one time he turned around and asked if God really exists, and if he did, why is he doing this. \n\n**Holy fuck, I was just in my 20s trying to bang chicks before Tinder**...I didn\u2019t know how to handle situations like this. \n\n\nAnyways, now that I got your attention...\n\nAsk the person in charge of the Donations / Children\u2019s Lifea department of what\u2019s acceptable etc.\n\nIf you\u2019ve remembered my posts, I\u2019ve always had plans of starting a mass donation / charity effort. \n\nBased on my conversation with the lady in charge of the department, this is what she said would be the best option for that specific location, yours may vary. \n\n\nI offered to have a PUR membership and give them a choice of digital vs physical copy of Game Informer. (**Digital would require every kid signing in to same account...so not a possibility and best to go with Physical.**)\n\n No this isn\u2019t specific to GME, but if you\u2019re playing \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nIf you\u2019re not playing GME, you can still make some kid\u2019s day. \n\nAnyways, the lady said physical copy would be best because they can decide who would be the best candidate to enjoy it. \n\nYou can also use the hospital\u2019s phone number and let them know to utilize the account\u2019s certificates for toys etc. There\u2019s usually quite a few stuff on clearance that they can pick up, or you can etc. \n\nMaybe you\u2019ve got more tendies to spare, ask them if they would be interested in Nintendo switches or traditional consoles. Buy used ones...with warranty...so if something happens, they can easily be swapped out. \n\nUltimately it\u2019s about making some kid\u2019s life a little better in the dark, alone, segregated (even more now with Covid) and miserable time they are going through. \n\nLove you all, even the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b, the ones who think BB has a chance, and the PLTR buyers in end of Nov.\n\n\n\n\n#2. Sad side of GME\n\n##This applied to me...I experienced this growing up. \n\nI had to save up money at 9 ( $70 )to buy a GBC (seemed forever) and bought a N64 + 1 game when everybody else was buying newer consoles. That\u2019s all I could afford with money I saved and how long it took me to get enough money. \n\nI love my parents, I\u2019m grateful for them. They risked everything for me to come to America and have a chance at life. It\u2019s hard to understand that a young age, but I am grateful for them and still grateful to have them. But at a young age and not being able to afford things that everyone else has...well it affects the kid.\n\nWell it\u2019s not because of GME, but GME\u2019s tiny store and close proximity layout makes it more noticeable than any other store. \n\nEver been in there, and you see a kid &lt;14 come in with a parent? They come in for a product and the kid is excited, then the parent finds out the price and realizes that it was beyond what they were expecting. \n\n\nNeedless to say, the whole store hears it and the kid is crushed and visibly affected by embarrassment. \n\nAnyways, it happens often, it may not be every time you go in, but I\u2019ve noticed it too often. \n\nI\u2019ve thought about offering to cover, but that would add on to the embarrassment of a stranger doing it in person...\n\n\nSo, how about making a great relationship with the store manager or lead etc, and offer to have a \u201cspecial GC\u201d for that reason. \n\nFill it up with $50 or whatever you feel like on a monthly or however often / after big plays...and ask them to use a portion of it for such customers.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be customer wanted $80 product but up sold them with $100 product and offer to cover $50 with that GC....\n\n\nIt should really be like \u201chey we\u2019ve got a customer who has donated some money and we can cover the extra $15 here etc\u201d\n\nThoughts?\n\n\n#3. Employees: \n\nGoes without saying, they are the front line and face of the company to the average customer. Today is PRO day, even dropping buy with pizza and drinks would make a huge difference. \n\n\n#4. Random people:\n\nBuy 1 or a few $10 GC, offer them separately and different times / places for people to claim them for free. \n\nYou\u2019ve now made someone save $10, and they will use it towards something at GME. Let them know it was made possible with the PUR membership and now they can have their own rewards and benefits for only $5...customer for life. \n\n\nThanks for reading, make your tendies in whatever ticker you want, but \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e hand with GME because we haven\u2019t even started the squeeze.
