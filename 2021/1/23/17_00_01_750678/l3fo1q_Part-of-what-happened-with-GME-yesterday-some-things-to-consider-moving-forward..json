Delta is a number between 0 and 1. Say you buy an option and the delta is .41, MM\u2019s have to buy 41 shares to limit their downward exposure. But as the share price moves closer to the strike price, delta will increase and thus the MM\u2019s will have to buy a few more shares (and vice versa with price moving down). So with the sheer amount of those otm options purchased yesterday (looking at you 55-60 calls), MM\u2019s had to hedge accordingly, but as more people bought those calls as the price became closer and closer to the strike, it created a fun feedback loop where the MM\u2019s were then forced purchase those additional shares as delta increased. So then after the halts, call buyers near and far took their profits which caused the MM\u2019s to unwind their exposure bringing the stock price back down. If you bought $3,000 worth of 60c 0DTE and sold at the right time, you would\u2019ve made a cool million+ (I know right what the fuck?!?!). So could this happen again next Friday? If a lot people expect a gamma squeeze like this to happen and buy a shitload of way otm calls, then it could be a self-fulfilling prophecy and there will be many new millionaires made next Friday. I personally have some PLTR calls I\u2019ll be selling next week after demo day to try and fuck around with some 0DTE\u2019s and most likely get burned lol.

Also, as of today GME has 8 more days for their fourth quarter earnings. You know what this means? Buy PowerUp rewards, buy a console for your wife\u2019s bf (preferably a bundle), buy used games (maximize profit margin), or fuck even buy Thor\u2019s battle axe and use it as a butt plug for all I care (we know after the past two weeks that\u2019s about the only thing that will fucking fit).
