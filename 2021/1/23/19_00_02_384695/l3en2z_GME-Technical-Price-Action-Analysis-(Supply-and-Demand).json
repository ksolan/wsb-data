We read S&D by looking at volume. Volume is the single most important metric on your chart as it explains S&D and we all know from Economics 101 S&D will determine price (which is then usually driven by value or the perception of value but in this case its driven by a bunch of lunatics).\n\nAs price moves up demand decreases and as price moves down Supply decreases. Equilibrium is found where S&D are balanced at a point where Sellers and Buyers agree on a price. If however for example demand increases as price moves up the whole Demand curve (red line) will shift up the blue line and a new higher equilibrium price will be found.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f2cifqadt3d61.png?width=388&format=png&auto=webp&s=61ac08d57b49a7b57f36acefbb5cfc485da567af\n\nWatching yesterdays price action and volume it was clear the stock was very bullish. For the last 4 years or so I have been in training with an institutional quant / trader and we are taught to ask the following questions.\n\n1. What did the market do with volume, and\n2. What did it do with liquidity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Price Action - 21st Jan](https://preview.redd.it/ia1bwr2ft3d61.png?width=1524&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0a592116761382f98cf4a3f69a42a0aa5e752b1)\n\n1. **Volume** \\- Look for the highest volume candles on the chart and see if price continued or if the candle reversed . On Thurs we see the highest volume candles are all down selling candles however they where all reversed (see the candles labelled with the red i.e. the selling volume was bought and not only was it bought it was most probably bought by large institutions as they are the ones with the order books to stop the market like that. Institutions do not buy at the market but rather on the limit and they buy in large quantities so they need volume. They either need to generate that volume through price action market manipulations enticing sellers into the market, or they buy when the see volume increasing on the books. They do not what the market to move before they have finished their accumulation so they enter at the limit at enough volume as to absorb as much as they can without scaring the price higher. They might even cap the markets upside keeping the price low so the can accumulate. So they buy 1000 and as price comes up the sell 500 to push the price back down, rinse and repeat, this is why accumulation patterns look like this..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qbxsmman64d61.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&s=6458dc2462e551ec2edf4cf4190dd92842aa8536\n\n1. **Liquidity** \\- There will be liquidity for the large players to accumulate as the round numbers and above or below pivot points. Institutions know where retarded traders like to keep their stops, they keep them right above / below pivots. The biggest issue for institutions is finding enough volume to fill their books. Now they want to buy low just like everyone else but as we know from S&D they lower you go the more buyers you will find not more sellers. For the institutions to fill their books they need to find SELLERS at lower price from whom they can buy. But why would anyone sell at a lower price (its less profitable for sellers). Therefore the best place to find sellers at lower prices is by finding the buyers stops. If the institutions can run the stops those buyers have to become sellers. So look for what happens when price goes above or below a pivot point. If price immediately goes back inside the pivot we know that that liquidity was bought (or sold). On the chart we see that everything price went below a pivot point (green boxes) it immediately bounced back inside showing that the liquidity was being bought. This also coincides with the high volume candles. So listen up retards to do not keep your stops in these areas as they will get run over leaving you on the sidelines watching as price moons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Price Action 22 Jan](https://preview.redd.it/sswrqrllt3d61.png?width=1757&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1ad27bc565f591ce03335dbdc223da10fde3137)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets have a look at the todays price action. GME opened bullish. The opening candle is an important level and should be marked. Its a good area to either buy or sell depending on your bias. There where two opps to buy at the red arrows. As price starts going up, buying volume keeps increasing, this shouldn't happen according to our S&D dynamics. When we see this we know that the market keeps finding more buyers at higher prices. This encourages the institution as their biggest fear is being able to get rid of their stock (ie finding buyers at higher prices that they can SELL to).\n\nWe have the rejection of the $76 level and price retraces to the 50% level. This is an important level of defence for the buyers. On the way back to the 50 we see the high volume candles being bought with the highest selling volume for the day being completely reversed. This shows the buyers are still engaged. The safest trade for is to wait for price to retrace back to and test the liquidity below that high vol candle. This is tested and bought on high volume showing institutional interest in the stock and once you see price start going back up above the pivot this is where you should buy. This is a very safe trade. The buy was also off the moving VWAP again an important metric for the institutions who want to buy below the VWAP. Many traders bonuses are calculated on this.\n\nLater on we see buying volume increasing again as prices rise.\n\nLastly for the Market Profile guys we can see buyers have emerged above the POC as price has gone bullish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3e3v728nt3d61.png?width=1473&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a2407bc136640f767bd8c864ea92eefd0275716\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion - Price action says its bullish. Two price targets that the institutions will target if we get above and hold 76. 1st one is 95-96 and second one is 110 - 115, watch for reactions.
