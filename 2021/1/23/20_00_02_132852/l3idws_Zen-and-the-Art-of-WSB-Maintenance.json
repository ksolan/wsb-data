Not only people who have never heard of WSB, but people who have never spared the stock market a thought in their entire life, are hearing about this wonderfully autistic community. \"GameStop\" was the second most trending Google search at the tail end of this week.\n\nBut many of us are unhappy with the mainstream media attention that WSB has been getting, and for good reason. Reddit is painted as some collective entity that planned to pump a stock to the moon with all of our individual hundreds of dollars (something that was not at all helped by that horrendous Twitter account). Weeks upon weeks of incredibly meticulous research and due diligence done by u/Uberkikz11 and u/Deepfuckingvalue have been reduced to so much as \"Reddit mob pumps stock\" in the eyes of the public.\n\nIn the days and weeks to come, WSB will be getting a large influx of new members thanks to all this public attention. Posts will ascend to levels of retardation **never before seen**. People asking WSB to pump penny stocks. People asking \"how do I sign up for Robinhood\". Remember, the perception of many new members will be \"WSB made themselves rich by pumping GME, they can make me rich too\". I urge all of you to keep the spirit of WSB alive and not let the influx of new degenerates dilute this place into a get rich quick forum for morons with a thirst for unscrupulous market manipulation tactics. The mods will have their work cut out for them, so use your downvotes and help them out as much as possible.\n\nAt the same time, however, remember that dumb money is still money. Do not reject people from the community because of their ignorance, because their ignorance is only the result of being misled by the media. **Do not validate people's claims that WSB is an angry mob of Redditors baselessly campaigning for GME.** Rather, educate them and gently caress the wrinkles out of their brains in a manner befitting a true WSB autist. **From Melvin and Citron's perspectives, this has turned from a struggle against a single online forum into a widespread battle against retail traders across the board. The pressure is on, even more so than before.**\n\n# \ud83d\ude80 Wallstreetbets in the eyes of Wall Street \ud83d\ude80\n\nWhat has transpired over the past week\u2014and what will continue to transpire going into the next few\u2014is likely the greatest redistribution of wealth from Wall Street to Main Street that has ever been seen. And Wall Street, as one would imagine, is not happy. In an ironic (but, perhaps, not unexpected) twist of fate, Larry Summers, the man who bailed out one of the largest corporate fraud rings in world history in 2008 while [simultaneously fighting to keep everyday American mortgage holders underwater](https://www.propublica.org/article/dems-obama-broke-pledge-to-force-banks-to-help-homeowners), is calling for [SEC regulation of a subreddit full of retail clowns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2590&v=mo5MGKM0Lds).\n\nIn every conceivable scenario, big money has seized every opportunity to milk Main Street, leaving retail traders high and dry while Wall Street fills its pockets with cash. In the words of everyone's favorite movie, \"Wall Street loves to use confusing terms to make you think only they can do what they do. Or even better, for you just to leave them the fuck alone.\"\n\nThis is an opportunity to punish firms like Melvin for the underhanded tactics that they've employed and given free passes for for too long. When people say \"democratize Wall Street\", *this* is exactly what they mean. This is an opportunity to level the playing field and illustrate that retail traders *can* come up with a good fundamental thesis\u2014and when it comes down to it, we can and will put our money where our mouth is.\n\n# \ud83d\ude80 For those of you who are new to WSB \ud83d\ude80\n\nI can speak only for myself, but I welcome the true artists amongst you. But if you're here because you believe Reddit can get you rich by pumping any stock that you choose to champion, you don't belong here and, while I don't speak for anyone else, I would kindly ask you to leave. I'd strongly encourage any new members to filter for \"Loss\" flairs for a dose of reality.\n\nHowever, if you are here because your interest as been genuinely piqued, take a moment to read some of the content by u/Uberkikz11 and u/Deepfuckingvalue to understand why so many have taken an interest in GME. I can confidently assure you that there is far, far more to this company than \"Reddit mob pumps stock\". Do not be offended by the culture here, but embrace it. **Remember, you are an adopted autist, not a colonist.**\n\nThis is an amazing community that has given back to charity far more selflessly than any Wall Street big wigs, and I absolutely hate how the media is representing us. The majority of us are not sending pizzas and merch to someone's personal address to harass them in real life. We rejoice in one another's victories, commiserate (but glorify) in one another' losses, and encourage one another with memes of varying levels of quality. This is the side of the community that I want people to see when the mainstream media directs them here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr** mainstream media is bad but also turned the larger public on to a chance to profit off of Melvin's tomfoolery; retail traders are slowly gaining traction in a space still largely dominated by Wall Street; keep the WSB spirit alive but behave yourself outside of the Reddit-sphere\n\nPositions: $3.7MM in GME, $1.15MM in BB.
