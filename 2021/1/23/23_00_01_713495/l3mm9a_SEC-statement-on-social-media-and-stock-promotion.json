I fully intend to hold GME for years, for example, because I believe in Cohen, much like many of us continue to hold Tesla even though it squoze considerably over the last year.

Invest in any company at your own risk. \n\n**TLDR**: reinstituting the positions or ban rule will keep WSB on the right side of the law, since it satisfies the need to disclose conflicts of interest. Also, don't pump and dump; only invest in companies that are popular on WSB if you think they're good investments, and do your own research. Finally, make sure to disclose that, like me, you are a retard and not qualified to give investing advice, so your post shouldn't be taken as investment advice. \n\nIf we do all of this, the media can paint WSB in whatever light they'd like, but the SEC would have no legal basis to shut WSB down.", "author_fullname": "t2_i56pq", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "SEC statement on social media and stock promotion", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Discussion"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_l3mm9a", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 36, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 36, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1611471214.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So the SEC put out the following alert/bulletin in 2015 on social media use, stock promotion, and fraud, and it&#39;s very relevant today:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/updated-1\">https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/updated-1</a></p>\n\n<p>I think it&#39;d be good for every WSBer to read, because it details what is and isn&#39;t illegal about social media and stock promotion. </p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, the SEC has prosecuted individuals in the past who used social media to either (1) spread misinformation (rumors also count under their definition of misinformation) about a stock, or (2) promote the stock without disclosing a conflict of interest (e.g., that they received stock for promoting the ticker, <strong>or that they owned the stock</strong>). </p>\n\n<p>Because of the above, I think it is <em>absolutely crucial</em> that we reinstitute the positions or ban rule, because that satisfies a</p>\n\n<p>They also note that promoting pump and dumps on social media is--of course--illegal, which is why no one here should be trying to start a short squeeze if you don&#39;t also believe the company is valuable.
