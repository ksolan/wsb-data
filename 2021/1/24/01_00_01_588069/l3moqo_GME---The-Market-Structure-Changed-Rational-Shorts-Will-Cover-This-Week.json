{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**TLDR: Friday showed GME's market has fundamentally changed. This makes value-based shorts invalid. I think shorts, most of whom are short on a value thesis, will choose to cover this week and next. This will cause the price to be supported. I have no idea what will happen Monday as there's a lot of option settlement stuff and Friday was way up, but I think this week is likelier than not green on short covering (Finally). There is downside risk with the massive gamma ramp down, but I don\u2019t think it will get activated this week.**\n\n*Disclaimer: I have a few long-duration puts that I intend to dump as soon as possible because they no longer match my views. I may go long. Yes my trades on GME have sucked.*\n\n*No, I don't have updated gamma charts, those become available Monday morning. I too am curious.*\n\nTrades only make sense in the context of the market the stock exists in and the people/groups trading the stock. This stock does not exist in the same market it existed in even a week ago, and certainly 2 weeks ago, and as such, many trade theses became very obviously invalid Friday. **That means the value-based short GME trade that made sense from a value basis a few weeks ago no longer makes sense, even though the price is even higher.**\n\nThe key actors here are:\n\n**Majors:**\n\nRetail (which can be summarized as net long).\n\nThe Market Makers / Option Dealers\n\nLong/Short Hedge Funds\n\nThe Company\n\n**Minors:**\n\nValue Mutual Funds\n\nWildcard: Other hedge funds\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Emoji copyright holders\n\nHere\u2019s my analysis of each:\n\n**Market Context:** Before this week, you could see GME as a battle to determine fair value of a stock. At this point, though, you can look at the GME chart in a 6 month or 1 yr view, and it looks like more like a hyberbolic/bubble situation \u2013 there have been many we don't name here, and then Tilray during the 420 boom. Maybe it is a bubble, maybe it's not. But it can look like one, and critically, bubbles scare the hell out of shorts (unless they can precisely predict when capital flows will flip, which they can't in this case).\n\n**Retail:** Retail, in particular WSB and retail, have made it\u2019s intentions clear. Buy at any price until the shorts capitulate, and WSB and other retail traders have shown a lot more capital available than in the past in these scenarios, which makes it a very credible threat alongside the obvious emotional investment. Additionally, while this may price down at some point, past situations that look like this resulted in a new higher stable price at the end of it, which is hard to predict what support the stock has to those who want to short it.\n\n**MMs/Option Dealers** \u2013 They got burned hard Friday. Normally they are happy to sell you guys tons of options, and provide liquidity on exits, and lend out their long shares to short sellers for fees, and this kind of volume and volatility sounds like enormous profit to them. But because they over-sold $60 calls and could not hedge \u2018smoothly\u2019, they got burned to the tune of low 9 figures as a group. They are going to be careful to not get burned again. They'll hedge more proactively, charge more for options, so net effect is, less concentrated gamma, but still lots of gamma. There is still a huge 50 million share gamma ramp down, but I don't see it getting triggered this week.\n\n**Long/Short Hedge Funds** \u2013 These are the guys who account for most of the short interest, and have not been margin called because they have huge, diversified books with dynamic risk management. They look at GME. They think it generously justifies a $20 target, and really think it\u2019s worth $10.  They are dead certain without a raise, the company is out of business in 3 years. They had conviction $10 was a good short, so $70 must be at least 7 times better to short, right?\n\nThe problem is, that thesis depends on the market context of this being an orderly market around a value stock. But they will look at this and see what looks more like a possible bubble, or at least a market with a bid that is not price sensitive. You don't want to short that unless it's actively collapsing, and this is riding up. **I would expect a rational CIO at one of those funds to point out the context mismatch (what was a value short, is now a bubble short), and tell the traders to get the hell out, ASAP, maybe even tomorrow (or Friday at the close, which might have been some of that melt-up to 64).** Lastly, a value hedge fund could still think this will 'eventually' fall back to fair value, but analysis of similar patterns often has the stock hang out at higher values, and it's hard to know what value exactly - but often somewhere between the old stable price and the new high prices. Extreme examples: NKLA and KODK - Both have pretty much empty hands, and trade at very elevated levels. GME doesn't have a completely empty hand. So seeing support well above $20 is entirely rational to believe. But even so, it's very hard to price the goal you want to exit at and form a strong short hypothesis, so they'll go trade something else where they know they will win. **I think this is a change of context that will finally cause short covering, and is why I\u2019m bullish the stock this week.**\n\n**The Company \u2013** GME is here for long term shareholder value. Their goal is not to screw the shorts, and it is also not to get the stock to the highest value possible in a 3 day period. They should and can issue new shares, but should do that with a growth story about why they are doing it in order to hopefully make a bid as they do it. I think that could happen any time, and it might come with a new role for Cohen, which of course make sit a bid. So I think they will raise, and I think the current market will bid the raise and it wont matter either way.\n\n**Value Mutual Funds \u2013** A lot picked up GME in the single digits. They\u2019ve been selling (example is the orderly position reduction of that GME board members stake). I expect they are mostly or entirely out by now, since these are now growth stock prices, and they thus will have little impact on this stock.\n\n**Wildcard: Hedge funds \u2013** A sufficiently large hedge fund can do very odd things to this stock by tossing a quarter to a half a billion of capital at it. They could bid it up with you, they also could try to trigger the gamma ramp down and pair with OTM puts. They could also do the Stevie Cohen \u2013 Sell an enormous amount of near the money calls or puts to dealers so as to ceiling or floor the price. Really hard to know. This could attract very sophisticated operators, to the aid or punishment of GME longs.\n\n**Wildcard: Insiders \u2013** Could see old management selling, but I don't think the market cares if they do.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Emoji copyright holders -** These guys are making so much money, buy call options on them.
