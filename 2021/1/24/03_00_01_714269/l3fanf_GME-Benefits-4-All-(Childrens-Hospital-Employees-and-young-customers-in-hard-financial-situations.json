I grew up in a low income but hard working immigrant household and parents who absolutely risked everything for me to have an opportunity in US. But like most can agree, those who know what it\u2019s like are more likely to give back. \n\n======================================\nI\u2019ve noticed a lot of users making similar threads and those are all wonderful. I\u2019ve been trying to get attention to Children\u2019s hospital for over a month but my efforts haven\u2019t gotten any attention. I\u2019m also including other people because of things I\u2019ve seen whenever I\u2019ve gone to GME stores. \n\nThis post will include 4 scenarios where we can help out. (There are plenty on Autism already, just don\u2019t do Autism Speaks)\n\nYou don\u2019t have to read all of them, just navigate to what interests you. \n\n\n1. Children\u2019s Hospitals: This one is close to my heart, and a brief story about it will be included at the bottom. \n\nI\u2019m buying [PUR Memberships ](https://ibb.co/CKmS9h0) on their behalf AFTER speaking with someone in charge and verifying etc. Full details at bottom. \n\n2. Sad side of GME: I\u2019ve seen so many young customers come with their parents (usually minorities) and want to buy a product, but the parent realizes it is above what they were expecting and could afford. Given how small stores are, everyone in the store hears that and the kid is just embarrassed. This was me growing up...\n\n\n3. The employees, remember today is a pro day sale. Perfect time to drop by with pizza &amp;amp;amp; goodies or something else. Shoutout to u/txbustanut but not everyone has to do something similar. It\u2019s all relative, just like how many shares we can buy. \n\n4. Offer few $10 GC to random people (maybe even to customers who are in store today but aren\u2019t pro members...they can use it and become one...)\n\n\n#Speaking of shares\n\nNever feel bad or ashamed that you can\u2019t buy as some people on here. Buy anything you can, you don\u2019t need to be a whale, you need to be an ant. Ever noticed how ants work together and carry big pieces of food? Well folks, we are all ants, some just bigger than others. Do your part, we break down walls, and we all feast together and can spread the wealth. \n\n\n\nAlright, I\u2019m going to include my original post from after we went private but couldn\u2019t post here...mainly because I\u2019m going to own up to what I said about BB and PLTR. I was wrong about it, however, the money put into those would\u2019ve still got more returns yesterday in GME and definitely going forward....\n\n\n#1. Children\u2019s Hospital\n\nCall up your local children\u2019s hospital, ask for the donations department and speak with them. \n\n#little story time\n\nI have a cousin who had major health problems when he was 9, he spent most of the year in the children\u2019s hospital. I spent many days taking care of my other cousin / his 8 year old brother when the parents were working. It wrecked havoc on their life, but nothing gets me more than seeing how it affected my cousins. \n\nThe one in the hospital would question if he would be \u201cnormal\u201d again. The other one that I would look after, one time he turned around and asked if God really exists, and if he did, why is he doing this. \n\n**Holy fuck, I was just in my 20s trying to bang chicks before Tinder**...I didn\u2019t know how to handle situations like this. \n\n\nAnyways, now that I got your attention...\n\nAsk the person in charge of the Donations / Children\u2019s Life department of what\u2019s acceptable etc.\n\nIf you\u2019ve remembered my posts, I\u2019ve always had plans of starting a mass donation / charity effort. \n\nBased on my conversation with the lady in charge of the department, this is what she said would be the best option for that specific location, yours may vary. \n\n\nI offered to have a PUR membership and give them a choice of digital vs physical copy of Game Informer. (**Digital would require every kid signing in to same account...so not a possibility and best to go with Physical.**)\n\n No this isn\u2019t specific to GME, but if you\u2019re playing \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nIf you\u2019re not playing GME, you can still make some kid\u2019s day. \n\nAnyways, the lady said physical copy would be best because they can decide who would be the best candidate to enjoy it. \n\nYou can also use the hospital\u2019s phone number and let them know to utilize the account\u2019s certificates for toys etc. There\u2019s usually quite a few stuff on clearance that they can pick up, or you can etc. \n\nMaybe you\u2019ve got more tendies to spare, ask them if they would be interested in Nintendo switches or traditional consoles. Buy used ones...with warranty...so if something happens, they can easily be swapped out. \n\nUltimately it\u2019s about making some kid\u2019s life a little better in the dark, alone, segregated (even more now with Covid) and miserable time they are going through. \n\nLove you all, even the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b, the ones who think BB has a chance, and the PLTR buyers in end of Nov.\n\n\n\n\n#2. Sad side of GME\n\n##This applied to me...I experienced this growing up. \n\nI had to save up money at 9 ( $70 )to buy a GBC (seemed forever) and when I was 12 I bought a N64 + 1 game when everybody else was buying newer consoles. That\u2019s all I could afford with money I saved and how long it took me to get enough money. That one game was the only game I was ever able to get. \n\nI love my parents, I\u2019m grateful for them. They risked everything for me to come to America and have a chance at life. It\u2019s hard to understand that at a young age, but I am grateful for them and still grateful to have them. But at a young age and not being able to afford things that everyone else has...well it affects the kid, not just mentally, but may also cause a small % of kids to go down the wrong path for reasons related to lack of $. \n\nThe sad side of GME is not because of GME, but GME\u2019s tiny store and close proximity layout which makes it more noticeable than any other store. \n\n\nNeedless to say, the whole store hears the parent saying they can\u2019t afford it (because of an extra ~$20) and the kid is crushed and visibly affected by embarrassment and as of how everyone else just heard it. When you\u2019re young, things take bigger toll on you mentally and hit you harder. \n\nAnyways, it happens often, it may not be every time you go in, but I\u2019ve noticed it too often. \n\nI\u2019ve thought about offering to cover, but that would add on to the embarrassment of a stranger doing it in person...I know I would\u2019ve been even more embarrassed if a stranger did that right in front of me. \n\n\nSo, how about making a great relationship with the store manager or store lead etc, and offer to have a \u201cspecial GC\u201d for that reason. \n\nFill it up with $50 or whatever you feel like on a monthly or however often / after big plays...and ask them to use a portion of it for such customers.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be customer wanted $80 product but up sold them with $100 product and offer to cover $50 with that GC....\n\n\nIt should really be like \u201chey we\u2019ve got a customer who has donated some money and we can cover the extra $15 here etc\u201d\n\nThoughts?\n\n\n#3. Employees: \n\nGoes without saying, they are the front line and face of the company to the average customer. Today is PRO day, even dropping by with pizza and drinks would make a huge difference. \n\n\n#4. Random people:\n\nBuy 1 or a few $10 GC, offer them separately and different times / places for people to claim them for free. \n\nYou\u2019ve now made someone save $10, and they will use it towards something at GME. Let them know it was made possible with the PUR membership and now they can have their own rewards and benefits for only $5...customer for life. Maybe suggest that on a month they won\u2019t be using the certificate to use it for a GC in a similar way and pay it forward to someone else\u2019s membership. \n\n\nThanks for reading, make your tendies in whatever ticker you want, but \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e hand with GME because we haven\u2019t even started the squeeze. PS I personally believe in the long haul 2023 turnaround....\n\n\nDonations are like gains, sure it\u2019d be nice to have huge amounts, but it\u2019s all relative, just like anything else in life.
