We're gonna bust an institutional short hedge fund Robinhood-style in the middle of a global pandemic and trigger a great redistribution of wealth.\n\nTLDR: Short squeeze trigger might've changed from waiting for GME/RC news about positive GME growth & direction to the gamma squeeze triggering intolerably high prices for shorts and/or margin calling. Short squeeze timeline might've just been moved closer by months. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 and buy \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 (shares or calls).\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo by now you've probably heard that the price hikes on the past two Fridays were due to gamma squeezes. When calls are purchased, Market Makers buy some shares just in case they have to pay out or provide shares when the contract is settled. This lowers their risk, and they are generally good at not losing money.\n\nSo what happened Friday? Literally every open call that was sold at any time hit their strike price became ITM, because the highest strike available was $60 and the stock closed at \\~$65. Even if the call didn't expire until 2023, their risk management policies dictate that they must purchase shares to cover their potential downside.\n\nWhat drives stock prices? Supply and demand. Supply was already low on Friday, and MMs started hedging their positions gobbling up shares left/right/center at whatever price they could get, driving up demand. The stock price surged (praise be) and we collectively did our little happy dances.\n\nNow apparently, these \\~10-15M shares should be cleared by around Tuesday and in the hands of anybody deciding to exercise their call options. If those investors \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 and don't sell those shares, it decreases liquidity and increases the ceiling of the gamma short feedback squeeze.\n\nSo the gamma squeeze went like this. People bought calls at any price, for any date, and on Friday they had all closed ITM, profitable for those who hold the calls but painful for MMs and the people who sold the calls who now need to find millions of shares to buy. New calls at higher strikes (\\~$115) will be available next week, and the same thing can potentially happen again, especially if there's a good chunk of those outstanding 15M shares that still need to be purchased. What'll happen when people buy calls again on Monday but MMs still need to buy millions of shares by Tuesday? Supply and demand, the price will soar again. What happens when the price approaches ITM territory for new outstanding calls? MMs need to hedge by buying shares. What happens when MMs need to buy more shares from a smaller pool of available shares? Supply and demand.\n\nWe've achieved the gamma feedback loop.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nBuying ITM or near OTM calls will force MMs to hedge by buying more shares which will raise the stock price and bring higher-strike calls closer to ATM/ITM which forces them to buy more shares , all in a vicious loop.\n\nDO, NOT, SELL, YOUR, SHARES.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\n\nNow, onto the short squeeze.\n\nThere are still 102.3% shares shorted. Literally more shares have been shorted than Gamestop has issued. As of Friday after market close, the short squeeze has not yet squoze.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2xc4o/gme\\_moass\\_update\\_ortex\\_data\\_12221](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2xc4o/gme_moass_update_ortex_data_12221/)\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo what is the short squeeze?\n\nA quick background because some are new to this, but since it's been explained in plenty of other DDs for months now here's the short version (haha).\n\nCertain huge hedge funds thought GME would pull a blockbuster and implode down to $0. They completely ignored the fact that the ex-CEO of Nintendo is now on the Board of Directors, along with Ryan Cohen and the two people that helped him build Chewy from nothing to a $3.5B powerhouse that beat Amazon at online retail. The legend outcompeted Jeff fucking Bezos after getting denied funding by \\~100 VCs, and he only sold Chewy cause his beloved father & mentor suddenly died while he was getting ready to take Chewy public.\n\nPetSmart bought Chewy and promptly IPOd it to $10B.\n\nAfter the last earnings report he threatened the GME BOD to stop dropping the ball OR ELSE. He put his money where his mouth is and bought 13% of GME. They listened, struck a deal with him and are getting ready to pivot GME (just like $BB). GME will do two main things:\n\n1. Transform their online presence to make it the Amazon of gaming\n2. Update their retail locations to enter into the PC gaming market\n\nAll of this was discovered thanks to many hard-working autists who put together fantastic DDs which are now making us bank. We salute you, and personally, thank you very much because this will measurably change my life (which is why I'm writing this).\n\nPrevious to the two GME gamma squeezes, we were essentially waiting for GME to announce what our hard-working autists have been telling us ever since RC released his warning letter to the GME BOD. Why is this important?\n\nBecause the bears still believe in their bear thesis.\n\nThe bears still think GME will Blockbuster and they believe the current bump in stock price is the equivalent of a \"dip\" for them, so they doubled-down on their short position.\n\nUntil their thesis is proven wrong/outdated via news from either GME or RC outlining GME's new growth plans, shorts will cling to their bear thesis and think we are delusional retards. Truth is, we just figured out GME's plan before the shorts did, and we're clinging to the unofficial news because it simply, makes, sense.\n\nSOOO, once the news breaks that GameStop actually has a really good growth plan, bears will say \"awe fuck\" and start buying shares to close out their short position. Except wait, supply and demand again. There are so few shares now that they would have to buy our shares, sell them back, buy them again at a higher price, sell them back, buy them again at a higher price, sell them again, and on and on again to the moon, about 13x. That will be the true squeeze we have all been waiting for.\n\nWhat we didn't realize is that\n\n1. The catalyst to trigger the short squeeze has potentially changed, and\n2. The timeline might've just moved a lot closer to the present day\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nI Present To You: The Gamma Short Feedback Squeeze\n\nThe gamma squeeze causes MMs to buy shares, driving price up. Shares are purchased, fewer shares are available to be sold, price goes up. This increases the loss floor of the shorted shares for short sellers and increases the interest paid to continue shorting them. Remember, shorting a stock caries unlimited risk because a share price can climb to an unlimited height. As the risk increases, the shorts get scared. If they are forced to cover, their losses will be proportional to the increase of the stock price. Higher price = higher losses for them. They can keep paying interest, but at some point the risk becomes too great and they throw in the towel. Now that GME has hit mainstream media, everybody and their grandmother has heard in the news that GME squeeze is incoming and is getting in on the game. Supply and demand, price goes up, supply goes down, gamma squeeze forces MMs to buy more to hedge, supply goes down, price goes up.\n\nPrice keeps going up, shorts get mighty nervous. They might decide to ride it out for a few years, EXCEPT......\n\nWhen there are no more shares available to trade, margin calls will begin. Shares that were purchased with borrowed funds will be forcibly liquidated, and you can bet that at some point Melvin's shorts will be forcibly margin called.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nBoom, short squeeze triggered by the gamma squeeze: The Gamma Short Feedback Squeeze\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe gamma squeeze will firstly drive the price a lot higher BEFORE the main short squeeze. It will also feedback into the short squeeze which increases with probability every time more shares are taken off the board and every time the stock price increases.\n\nAll you have to do, is\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50, and if you can, buy \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 (shares or calls).\n\nThis is history in the making, an unprecedented event. Not only is the ratio of shares shorted to shares realistically available to sell higher than the VW squeeze, but it's getting turbocharged by a gamma squeeze too. We are double-dipping this bitch!! This went from a once-in-a-decade opportunity to a once-in-a-century play, and we get to take from shitty companies counting on others to fail and redistribute their wealth to the average retard.\n\nIf you benefit from this play, please remember to set aside funds for taxes (bless you tax-free TFSA) and for charity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPosition: 346 shares @ $20 (doubling Monday once funds transfer). \n\nAlso, I listed my 7-series for sale and will buy a $3k shitbox to drive until the squeeze has squoze, sinking the sale proceeds directly into $GME.

That will be the true squeeze we have all been waiting for.</p>\n\n<p>What we didn&#39;t realize is that</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The catalyst to trigger the short squeeze has potentially changed, and</li>\n<li>The timeline might&#39;ve just moved a lot closer to the present day</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80</p>\n\n<p>I Present To You: The Gamma Short Feedback Squeeze</p>\n\n<p>The gamma squeeze causes MMs to buy shares, driving price up. Shares are purchased, fewer shares are available to be sold, price goes up. This increases the loss floor of the shorted shares for short sellers and increases the interest paid to continue shorting them. Remember, shorting a stock caries unlimited risk because a share price can climb to an unlimited height. As the risk increases, the shorts get scared. If they are forced to cover, their losses will be proportional to the increase of the stock price. Higher price = higher losses for them. They can keep paying interest, but at some point the risk becomes too great and they throw in the towel. Now that GME has hit mainstream media, everybody and their grandmother has heard in the news that GME squeeze is incoming and is getting in on the game. Supply and demand, price goes up, supply goes down, gamma squeeze forces MMs to buy more to hedge, supply goes down, price goes up.</p>\n\n<p>Price keeps going up, shorts get mighty nervous. They might decide to ride it out for a few years, EXCEPT......</p>\n\n<p>When there are no more shares available to trade, margin calls will begin. Shares that were purchased with borrowed funds will be forcibly liquidated, and you can bet that at some point Melvin&#39;s shorts will be forcibly margin called.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80</p>\n\n<p>Boom, short squeeze triggered by the gamma squeeze: The Gamma Short Feedback Squeeze</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80</p>\n\n<p>The gamma squeeze will firstly drive the price a lot higher BEFORE the main short squeeze. It will also feedback into the short squeeze which increases with probability every time more shares are taken off the board and every time the stock price increases.</p>\n\n<p>All you have to do, is\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50, and if you can, buy \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 (shares or calls).</p>\n\n<p>This is history in the making, an unprecedented event. Not only is the ratio of shares shorted to shares realistically available to sell higher than the VW squeeze, but it&#39;s getting turbocharged by a gamma squeeze too. We are double-dipping this bitch!! This went from a once-in-a-decade opportunity to a once-in-a-century play, and we get to take from shitty companies counting on others to fail and redistribute their wealth to the average retard.</p>\n\n<p>If you benefit from this play, please remember to set aside funds for taxes (bless you tax-free TFSA) and for charity.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Position: 346 shares @ $20 (doubling Monday once funds transfer). </p>\n\n<p>Also, I listed my 7-series for sale and will buy a $3k shitbox to drive until the squeeze has squoze, sinking the sale proceeds directly into $GME. When this happens I&#39;ll be able to upgrade to a lambo instead.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "coin_price": 150, "id": "award_f44611f1-b89e-46dc-97fe-892280b13b82", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png", "days_of_premium": 0, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=16&height=16&auto=webp&s=a5662dfbdb402bf67866c050aa76c31c147c2f45", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=32&height=32&auto=webp&s=a6882eb3f380e8e88009789f4d0072e17b8c59f1", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=48&height=48&auto=webp&s=e50064b090879e8a0b55e433f6ee61d5cb5fbe1d", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=64&height=64&auto=webp&s=8e5bb2e76683cb6b161830bcdd9642049d6adc11", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=128&height=128&auto=webp&s=eda4a9246f95f42ee6940cc0ec65306fd20de878", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Thank you stranger.
