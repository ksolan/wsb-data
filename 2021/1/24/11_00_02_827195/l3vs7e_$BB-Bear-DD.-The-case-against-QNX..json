{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Listen up. It's hard for a gay bear to say no to some BB; however, I miss the good quality bear posts and I'm not taking any more of the glittery $BB DD lying down. This post is a critique of positive remarks made about BlackBerry QNX. This is not financial advice. Welcome to the casino.\n\ntl;dr QNX is not high-tech, isn't primed for crazy growth and isn't something that can milk a monopoly position.  \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b \n\nThe retards with their bullish DD for $BB are getting off on explaining RTOS, the impenetrable security, the moat of standards, QNX's usage count, the EV & autonomous car revolution, and IVY. All of these points are weak and don't combine to create a strong bundle of sticks.  \n\n**RTOS**  \nStop throwing around the term RTOS like it's magic. An RTOS is just OS that lets tasks ask to be run within a certain time. Engineering students spin up basic RTOSs in half-semester courses. Sure QNX is going to be vastly more complicated than a student project, but stop throwing around \"RTOS\" like it's secret tech.\n\n**\"It's so secure!\"**  \nKnown vulnerability counts of a software can be low for non-flattering reasons: the software is not open-source, no-one cares to hack it, there arn't many features and the software doesn't change fast. I think that the autonomous and EV progress will increase scrutiny of automotive software and we will start to see some QNX bugs. In addition, the pressure on QNX to start adding features faster will also bring some bugs. Random speculation: I bet that there are some zero-day vulnerabilities of QNX known to organizations like the NSA.\n\n**\"But QNX has a moat! Look at all these safety standards.\"**  \nThese safely standards are a shitty moat that will backfire. \nIn general, I think safety standards for software are a joke. Check out this [PDF guide to ISO 26262](https://www.feabhas.com/sites/default/files/2016-06/A%20quick%20guide%20to%20ISO%2026262%5B1%5D_0_0.pdf). The standard focus on, among other things, to \"use style guides\" and \"use naming convection\" and \"restrict coupling between software components\". The whole standard seems like a joke.\n\nOne illuminating document I found titled \"Tesla comments on the cyber security regulation interpretation document\" ([source](https://globalautoregs.com/participants/409-tesla)) is Tesla making recommendations on how to update the W.29 standards. It has the following passage:\n\n> \"We believe the current regulations and interpretations extensively consider the context of a traditional OEM \"model-year\" release rate, but do not factor in the perspective of a company that releases software at a faster rate than once or twice per year - similar to the model used by every other modern internet-connected consumer device. The current regulations and interpretations do not fully consider the overhead introduced to a manufacturer that releases software at a frequent pace. We believe is the direction the entire industry will move in, especially to address security and safety considerations. Any requirement to submit documentation, or wait for approval, for every individual software release will compromise velocity and agility; and works against the goals of a cyber security strategy. The regulation should be designed so it is based on evaluation of the manufacturer's internal processes, appropriate records of activities, and trust between manufacturers and authorities.\"\n\nClaims that Tesla is having difficulty passing these standards carry truth but are misguided; the standards are archaic and don't fit with modern software development and Tesla is contributing to these standards being rewritten. \n\n**\"Look at the 175 million vehicles using QNX!\"**  \nIs this an argument for growth or for a monopoly? An argument for growth shouldn't be \"QNX already has a large % market penetration\". In comparison, the growth argument for EVs and self-driving cars is that there are hardly any now, and in 30 years most cars will be EVs with self-driving capabilities. If QNX has X% of the market now, I need evidence for why this will grow. Instead, if you are arguing that QNX has a monopoly, this also seems flawed. A quick google finds other companies have automotive platforms, such as GreenHills software which claims also to be \"Proven in Hundreds of Millions of Vehicles\" and also meets the standards such as ISO 26262. \n\nI'm pretty sure nearly every car released in the last 20 years runs an OS of some sort. It's used to run tasks like like controlling the breaks, turning on your window wipers, lights, sound etc. RTOS is already a fundamental requirement of cars. Saying things like \"EVs and self-driving cars means BB to the moon\" is like saying we should invest in air bag companies because of strong growth of EVs and self-driving cars.\n\n**BlackBerry IVY**  \nI don't get how this is huge news. The press release is vague on the details.  What actually is BlackBerry contributing here? What does BlackBerry get? 50/50 of what? Amazon wants everyone using AWS and will be happy to make deals to get people onto AWS. My guess is that AWS just needs a partner to figure out a good way to design some good APIs for car data. BlackBerry will be useful to AWS for a few years and then discarded. \n\n**Talent**  \nBullish $BB DD doesn't even cover this, and it's probably one of the most important factors. A software companies long term advantage is it's strength to attract top talent. I don't see BB being able to compete in this game at all. I encourage people to check out some of the reviews of BlackBerry QNX on Glassdoor. It seems that most employees enjoy working an QNX but think that the parent company BlackBerry is dragging them down. Poor QNX doesn't even have a separate careers page\u2014you get redirected to BlackBerry's career page which mixes all of their departments together on one page. Furthermore, looking at LinkedIn profiles of current BlackBerry QNX employees shows that the developer workforce is heavy on the old-guard and doesn't seem to have much young top-tier talent. If $BB can moon, maybe it can attract more talent, but currently, I think talent is going to be a serious issue for BlackBerry QNX.\n\n**Parting sentiment**  \nQNX will either continue to be a low level RTOS that moves your window wipers, or they will be squeezed-out as car companies or companies like Cruise or Deep Scale develop their own low-level OS or use an open-source one. I bought BB in the hype and I think there is a strong case for it being undervalued, but I place a low probability on BB becoming some automotive superstar based on QNX. \n\nPosition: I have 160 BB shares.\n\nEdit: emoji", "author_fullname": "t2_gekg9", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "$BB Bear DD.
