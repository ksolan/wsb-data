{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Let me first start off with the most important items first:\n\nPositions: 385 shares cost about 35, 2/5 calls and 1/29 calls.\n\nI know this subreddit has been flooded with GME posts the last few days but its for good reason. We are all looking at a once in a lifetime opportunity. I have been seeing a lot of posts today about the future and whats going to happen to GME and that we are bad guys and all that shit. Who gives a fuck what the talking heads have to say. Retail traders are winning this battle and its that simple.\n\n**Last Week:**\n\nFirst lets look at what happened last week. It was a battle all week. Every single day was a head to head battle between bulls and bears.\n\nThe price action Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday was very similar. You saw a price run up in the morning around the same time every day and then the price faded away and GME went negative for a period of time. After the price faded it started to gradually climb again.\n\nI believe this price action was a \"coordinated attack\" by the shorts. Just look at the timing. All three days at almost the same time showed the same price action. If you don't know what I am talking about, how about listening to our favorite boomer [Jimbo Cramer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI&ab_channel=dehurlock) explain it. Skip to about 45 seconds in. This is nothing new. The shorts like Melvin have plenty of weight they can throw around and easily move a stock like GME with a low float and low market cap. It didn't work though. The bulls prevailed by buying the dip everytime.\n\nOn top of that they began to take control of the media narrative. It first started with Citron's tweet and honestly sloppy video about how GME is going back to 20. Why 20? Idk probably their break even price. He provided no reason for why 20 was the magic number. Ok boomer, next.\n\nBut the negative media coverage towards WSB and all retail in general began to heat up on Friday when there was a \"gamma squeeze\" (if you don't know what a gamma squeeze, go back to previous WSB post that explain). Acting like it was our fault Market Movers practiced bad risk management. It is never the big monies fault if you haven't noticed.\n\nThe negative media coverage is getting serious over the weekend. You think Melvin doesn't have any connection at Goldman Sachs? You don't think they don't have media connections at almost every media outlet available?\n\nBulls 4 Bears 0\n\n**The Long Term Future:**\n\nIf you believe Ryan Cohen is going to turn around this company than a 50 billion market cap company in 5-10 years is not insane. The gaming industry is going to be 500 billion plus in 5-10 years easy. Gamestop could control 10% of the market without a doubt. But that's only if you believe in Ryan Cohen's vision. At these prices we are still looking at a potential 10 bagger in 5-10 years.\n\n**Near Term Future:**\n\nI have no idea whats going to happen this upcoming week. But don't get it twisted, its going to be a wild week with surprises. But if I had to speculate here is what I would say is going to happen.\n\n1. Hedge funds will continue to throw their weight around. Just more aggresively. The hedge funds are bleeding money. No question about that. I doubt Melvin is going to go out of business because of this though, lets be real. But they definitely don't want to be known as the hedge fund that got out played by fucking a bunch of retail investors. That reputation shot might send them packing. Because of this I don't think they will throw in the towel. Rich people on that level are arrogant, they are cocky. They think less of us average people. They think we are stupid. They are going to come after us all week. They will be putting huge amounts of resources into the battle. No question. Expect them to continue running the price up and then down again and other things that we shaven't seen yet.\n2. The media coverage is going to heat up and its going to be all negative. From the mass media's point of view, we are the bad guys. We are uneducated, gamblers trying to create destruction. They are going to talk down about Gamestop and how they are a failing business. The media is apart of the system. They are big money. They are not going to give retail investors positive news coverage. Jim Cramer is not going to be positive about retail investors. It is in their interest to keep up as the little guy.\n3. We are going to hear something from Gamestop management. Who knows what it will be but at some point they will do or say something. There is a lot of talk about Gamestop doing their shelf offering soon. I mean yeah why wouldn't they? But here is the time. Its only a 100 million dollar shelf offering. That will not bail out the shorts. But people may get scared and think it will bail out the shorts. The number of shares shorted are around 70 million!!! if Gamestop was able to do a self offering and offered even just 50 million that would be the most bullish piece of news they can give us. I mean 50 million shares at 65 bucks a pop is a cool 3.25 billion dollars. That would be EXTREMELY bullish. They also wont offer enough stock to bail them out because Ryan Cohen didn't just acquire 20% of the company just to have it diluted back down to fucking 12%.\n\n**Biggest Threats to the Potential Squeeze**\n\n1. People sell their stock. Simple. Retail investors are going to start to get nervous. They are going to be listening to the talking heads on the TV that are telling them to take profits because the valuations are too high. Even though these are the same talking heads who said Nikola was a innovative company at fucking 50 billion market cap and they were literally pushing trucks down a hill to act like they can move themselves. Doesnt matter though, most average joes will watch the TV and listen to them because that's what media is used for.\n2. People sell their stock because they are afraid of the self offering bailing out the short sellers. Again, I am pretty sure they cant offer enough stock to bail out the short sellers. Ryan Cohen wont want to lose his voting power and their 8-k from December only authorized 100 million dollar offering at a time.\n3. Retial and institution stop buying the stock and calls. Dont get me wrong it is not 100% retail traders. Institutions are a big factor. Matter of fact they own 100% of the float. Every share you and I own are all IOUs. Everyhting is fucked. Institutions wont sell because they are long term players, and they would need their shares back in order to sell.\n\n**Here is the bottom line**\n\nIf you are buying in tomorrow its because you have balls of steel and want to make fucking tendies. If you are skeptical and are going to buy in then sell if the price drops 10% then don't fucking waste your time on Robinhood. Focus on your dead end 9-5 job and stop trying to act like a day trader. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. If you're getting in, then GET THE FUCK IN.\n\nSorry for the long GME post. I just wanted people to know that this shit is next level. Nobody knows whats going on and the hedge funds are loading up their fucking ICB missiles right now getting ready to launch them\n\nThe question is are you going to flinch when they launch them? Or are you going to fucking shoot those commie missiles out of the sky by buying the fucking dip.\n\n**TL;DR:** If you are going to buy shares, buy the fucking shares. Then sit on your hands and enjoy the fucking ride. If you are going to buy shares only to sell them at the next 10% drop, listen to me loud and clear. Send me your wife phone number so I can be here boyfriend. You have no place here.\n\nGME to the fucking Moon.\n\nDisclaimer: you're a retard if you buy strictly on my post.
