{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "(Repost because I accidentally used a bad word)\n\n**Preface**\n\nLet me start by saying that I am a longtime lurker and slightly retarded. I am terrible at explaining things whether that be irl or on the internet, but I'll try my best...\n\nI'm not trying to take away the hype from GME, BB, or PLTR, but just would like to share a stock you should keep on your radar **that I feel** could easily double (or triple) in the next coming years.\n\n**FWIW:** I am currently BB gang with 1200+ shares at a cost basis of 12.52. This is everything I got in my Roth IRA aside from $600 worth of $T that I bought when I was a boomer investor thinking dividends were cool when I'm only 23. I refuse to sell it because it's down by $1 and I refuse to sell at a loss...like I said...I'm retarded.\n\nObligatory x10 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 to signify how much BB will multiply by.\n\n**Intro**\n\n**Takeda Pharmaceutical Company** **($TAK), currently trading at $18.13 as of 1/22 close**. Yes, I know what you're thinking:\n\n1. \"This company is old as shit\" (240 years to be exact), and\n2. \"Fuck Biopharmaceuticals/Biotech companies, I've always gotten burned\"\n\nWell, after what's transpired with $GME and $BB gang, we know that no matter what, an \"old\" company can have a big future if they set themselves up correctly with a competitive advantage. **AND** stop trying to play earnings/binary events and just **buy and hold shares**. Less stress, less autism, guaranteed money if the business is solid.\n\n**How Did this Company Catch My Eye?**\n\nSimply put, because of our **GILF and Savior, Cathie Woods.** So how does Mama Woods play into this? **If you subscribe to ARK's trade notifications** (I only started as of 12/15/20)**, take a look at how often TAK appears as a \"BUY\" since the beginning of December 2020 for their ARKG ETF.**\n\nDon't know? You can use [Cathie's Ark](https://cathiesark.com/arkg-holdings-of-tak) to see if for yourself...or look at this \"TAK Tracker\" I update now and then:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ow3jevyou5d61.png?width=399&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb31a53d09e167bba7d8162524a6ce9f9063b265\n\nARKG/Cathie increased her holdings **from 2.71m shares on 12/7/20, to over 17m shares as of 1/22/21. That's \\~15m shares of constant BUY in just 1.5 months.**\n\nWhen I first looked at how much TAK was in ARKG's ETF, it was sitting in the 19th spot in their fund. **Now it's 14th, and I can see it creeping into their Top 10 IF substantial buys continue at this rate**. ARKG continues to exponentially buy on typical down days, **but even after the \\~5% rise** as of 1/22 due to [Moderna vaccine news](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moderna-announces-first-participant-dosed-140000002.html), **they still bought** **1.6 million shares**. That's enough confirmation on my holdings to know this shit is \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 to the moon in the long-term.\n\n**What is So Good about Takeda that Warrants Us to Care?**\n\nThe value investor noob in me did what little of you retards care to do, and it's called reading their Quarterly/Annual reports and their Investor Relations presentation/website. Idk about y'all, but something about their [Q2 Investor Presentation](https://www.takeda.com/4ab331/siteassets/system/investors/quarterly-announcements/fy2020/qr2020_q2_p01_en.pdf) gives me insane hardness, that \ud83d\udc8e's can't compete. Let me show y'all some things I like:\n\n[This is the confidence I like to see from a company even despite COVID fucking everyone in the ass rn.](https://preview.redd.it/2lcq5f6zu5d61.png?width=1270&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8f9c45b8cfd4fd0d9119d3f927abd2f0300d017)\n\n[Main things I like: Resilient Global Brands Portfolio despite COVID, Raising guidance and forecasts in the upcoming year, TAK-721 catalyst, and insane drug pipeline in the next year and decade \\(2030\\).](https://preview.redd.it/tiq81mk1v5d61.png?width=1276&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec77de7cf948b0050ebd9488f35e215f28faca13)\n\nAnd also, look at their planned drug pipeline in the next decade:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p0whjov2v5d61.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=d42ebd1b6a9e294020f7ed80182dfe42420849e1\n\nIf you also read that Q2 presentation linked above, you'll see that all the planned objectives Takeda has outlined for the prior 2020 year...which they have met (slide 10 & 11). With how good and smart management has been thus far, I am very confident that they will be able to deliver a majority, if not all, of their objectives regarding their future drug pipeline in the second half of the year.\n\nAlso, Takeda **publicly** comes out and states that **they plan to increase their revenue** [50% by FY2030](https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2021/takeda-provides-pipeline-update-and-shares-goal-to-increase-revenue-50-percent-by-fy2030-at-the-39th-annual-jp-morgan-healthcare-conference/#:~:text=Highly%20Innovative%20Pipeline%20Supports%20Sustained%20Growth&text=Takeda's%20pipeline%20portfolio%20has%20the,representing%2050%25%20growth%20from%20FY2019). That's some big balls of confidence coming from their management...I like that...\n\n**Orphan Drug Market Potential**\n\nIf you look at a lot of the drugs in their upcoming pipeline, you'll see a lot of them have that \"Red Chromosome\" icon next to them. According to the legend at the bottom, that means that these drugs have \"Orphan Potential in at least one indication\". I was a Biology major in college, but still only know that the \"Mitochondria is the Powerhouse of the Cell\" ...*for fucks sake.*\n\nRegardless, what does this mean? Look at this [random ass article](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/orphan-drugs-market-100088) I Googled about \"Orphan Drug Market Potential\" and see what it says:\n\n>\"The global orphan drug market size **was valued at USD 151.00 billion in 2019** **and is projected to reach USD 340.84 billion by 2027, exhibiting a CAGR of 10.5% during the forecast period**\"\n\nThe graph they included displays it nicely for you autists who can't read:\n\n[Aka, by 2027, the Orphan Drug Market Size is going up bigly](https://preview.redd.it/4sl3b0slv5d61.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=3aecc0215a27d39e7303b13e424bba963ed75c91)\n\nThat's a x$3 billion increase in market size from now until 2027, and I believe Takeda is capitalizing on it heavily. I forgot to mention too...the title of that article seems to mainly state that it's in therapy areas of **Oncology,** Hematology, **Neurology**, Endocrinology, etc.)\n\nIt seems like I forgot to mention again, that Takeda has **5 business segments they R&D and develop drugs for: Oncology, Gastrointestinal, Neuroscience**, Rare-Diseases, and **Plasma Derived Therapy**. Needless to say, I think that Takeda is primed for this market potential especially with their current drug track record and drug portfolio. All of this = **hella revenue** **generation**\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8 .\n\n**Plasma Therapy Market**\n\nOne thing everyone can unanimously agree on this past year is that COVID can piss off. However, in terms of Pharma companies, the usage and development of plasma therapy still seems relatively infantile and untapped. Especially after seeing the beneficial use cases of [Plasma Therapy as a treatment for COVID](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/convalescent-plasma-therapy/about/pac-20486440), I figure that more and more companies will try and develop significant uses utilizing plasma.\n\nOne thing I noticed reading Takeda's Q2 presentation was this:\n\n[Found on Slide 27, talking about PDT Immunology growth for their PDT portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/pss81ms5w5d61.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa48efda97dfd804ada664b280227145e631ccf0)\n\nIt seems like Takeda has already **established** a footprint of Plasma Collection centers **globally** and is on track to invest & develop **MORE** plasma collection centers **by 2024**. I might also be retarded, but look at how they also say \"increase...manufacturing capacity\"; meaning that they **not only** plan on **collecting** plasma, but also developing and manufacturing PDT (Plasma Derived Therapy) products **all in house** (vertical integration seems to be analogous).\n\nOnce again, look at [this random article](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/08/2141427/0/en/Global-Plasma-Therapy-Market-to-Garner-Revenue-of-178-2-million-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-16-3-by-2026-despite-the-Covid-19-Crisis-Exclusive-Report-150-Pages-by-Research-Dive.html#:~:text=Filings%20Media%20Partners-,Global%20Plasma%20Therapy%20Market%20to%20Garner%20Revenue%20of%20%24178.2%20million,150%20Pages%5D%20by%20Research%20Dive) I found detailing the potential growth of the Plasma Therapy Market. They say:\n\n>**Plasma therapy market...the market is anticipated to harbor revenue of $432.8 million, increasing from a market size of $131.9 million in the year 2018, with a CAGR of 16.3% in forecast period.**\n\nAnd even better, [this site](https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/plasma-therapy-market.html) listing who the \"**KEY Players Operating in the GLOBAL Plasma Therapy Market\"** are. Here's a hint:\n\n[Obligatory \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80](https://preview.redd.it/n6p6u65iw5d61.png?width=405&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fbc948307ee3644a89790f0fb13fe799cbb49dc)\n\nOnce again, this is big market potential that Takeda has positioned themselves at the forefront. Not only are they collecting plasma, but also moving towards developing PDT products all in house. And if other companies/hospitals, want plasma to use/study with, Takeda will be there, ahead of its peers, distributing that plasma and collecting that insane revenue.\n\nSide note: Their PDT portfolio/efforts took a hit this year due to patients not coming into their collection centers due to COVID.\n\n**Undervalued as FUARRKKKKKKK Compared to It's Competitors**\n\nAs much as we like to shit on Seeking Beta for their shitty tactics to stray GME Astronauts from Mars, [this article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4397133-takeda-gracefully-navigating-covid-storm) talking about how Takeda navigated the COVID downturn with their drug resilient portfolio aligns with what I like, therefore, I approve.\n\nLook at [other companies](https://craft.co/takeda-pharmaceutical/competitors) in the same space as Takeda, which the article lays out simple enough for my smooth brain:\n\n[Stolen from the article so it might not be 100&#37; accurate since they posted it \\(Jan 4\\).](https://preview.redd.it/etgsyx9qw5d61.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8032cc9ab9612b2a853ffafd80dd65ebcbf6a9e)\n\nTakeda has a muchhhhhh smaller market cap than a lot of it's competitors, but seems to be better positioned in the upcoming future and doing much better in all other aspects. Idk...seems undervalued to me.\n\n**Other Good Shit I Like**\n\nI didn't realize DD (whether good or bad) takes this long to write...but I'm starting to get tired and realizing that I spent a few hours of my weekend doing this.\n\nI won't go into too much crazy detail, but I'll list other things I like about Takeda (latest updates can be seen on their [Q2 press release](https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2020/takeda-fy2020-h1-results-demonstrate-portfolio-resilience-confirms-full-year-management-guidance--raises-forecasts-for-free-cash-flow-reported-op--reported-eps/)):\n\n1. **They continue to strategically divest non-core assets of their business.** They profited \\~$11.3 billion dollars from their divestitures which **exceeded** their $10 billion dollar divestiture goal from 2020. This will help them deleverage their net debt/adjusted EBITDA to x2 from their current \\~x3.8, at a faster pace if they can keep this up.\n2. **Shire plc.** **acquisition will prove to be more bigly than people think.** This deal was recently finalized (2019) and with that came some debt from Shire. Financial reports + COVID, will make their reporting look icky, but their resilient revenue from their current drug portfolio will keep the money rolling until conditions start getting better. I think Shire will help strengthen Takeda's R&D and global presence much more than people think.\n3. **Catalysts in the 2021 year seems to be for** [**TAK-721**](https://www.takeda.com/en-us/newsroom/news-releases/2020/u.s.-food-and-drug-administration-accepts-new-drug-application-for-review/)**.** If it gets the thumbs up from FDA, this product will be a fat revenue generator as it is \"the first FDA-approved treatment for the chronic inflammatory disease\" of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Meaning....any of the hundreds of thousands of people affected by this will be prescribed this by the docs = **money bagger**.\n   1. Also, [COVID Vaccine news from Moderna](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moderna-announces-first-participant-dosed-140000002.html) is what caused the stock to jump 5% yesterday. Takeda will be the head honchos running the vaccine trials/rollout in Japan...so...that seems like good news to me.\n4. **LEAPS are cheap as fuck** (maybe for a bad reason). Reasonable price points though like 20c-25c are still able to be hit especially with all these catalysts coming out for Takeda in the coming years. **Cheaper leaps = less hurt when you lose & more potential upside!!!!**\n\n**CONS**\n\nCan't complete a DD without listing some cons..\n\n1. **Expiring patents + Generics + Drug Development**. Like with any drug, its patent expires. Therefore, generics will dive into the market, undercutting anymore potential revenue that Takeda could make off it's older drugs. Essentially, you have to be confident if Takeda can continue to develop new drugs to continue churning in revenue before their patents run out.\n2. **Politics.** IDK much about this shit, but I figure with Democrats at the lead of everything and them wanting healthcare to be more affordable, the big wigs in politics will pass laws that might make it so pharma companies & Takeda will have to lower their prices (=less revenue).\n3. **FDA + Drug Approvals**. Like I mentioned before, don't try and play binary events with biotechs. Like others have probably experienced, you'll get burned. But you can't forget, the FDA and other Drug Departments for other countries have to actually **approve** the drug in their country in order for it to even be sold. There's the risk here that their drugs won't get approved, therefore, can't be sold/will have to go back to the drawing board to get it approved. The delays might cost them.\n4. **This stock doesn't move**. Volume is shit for the stock and also note that even though the company came out saying it'll increase it's revenue by 50% by 2030, the stock basically went **down/didn't move**. Either investors are busy jerking to other stocks to not care, or that they don't think it'll happen until it shows up on the balance sheets.\n\n**TL;DR: If I learned anything this far in life, it's if you think you can do something well, there's always an Asian who can do it better. Cathie has realized this and doubled down as Takeda is the only Asian/Japanese company in the ARKG holdings. Therefore Takeda = \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.**\n\nPositions: 150 Shares & 18 25c 2022 LEAPS (I'm poor)\n\nEnd note: I'm not saying you **NEED** to get in now....just keep it on your radar for a potentially undervalued stock that has a lot of upside in the next decade.\n\nNote bene: I've been in conversations before where people said, \"Why not just invest in ARKG if you like Cathie so much??\" or that investing in ARKG is easier. **Well I could, but I'm autistic**. Plus, I like holding individual stocks and getting its dividend, and the thought of expense ratios taking some of my monies makes me flaccid \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n**Edit #1 1/23/21, 22:34:** **Yes this stock is flat/declining as fuck.** It's one of the cons I mentioned above. Don't be expecting rapid growth in a few months, it could be a **few years** (I told you I was autistic). **However, some reason I don't buy the whole \"Cash Park\" in ARKG just due to the influx of money going into the fund.** ***WE'RE retarded, but Cathie (ARK) isn't.*** Her whole narrative is investing in disruptive technology. TF is the point in parking ALL that cash in Takeda when there's a bunch of other holdings in ARKG she could put putting it towards? I'm fully convinced they know something we don't/don't see just yet. Especially for what Takeda has presented THUS FAR (Q2 presentation was October 29)...it just looks too good to be priced at what it currently is. Solid drug pipeline, big global presence, albeit soft on the financials - but I'm confident it'll turn around by next earnings report, or at least show better horizons.\n\n**Other stuff people in the comments have pointed out are very valid though to consider as part of your DD on whether to get into this stock (I reckon you should be able to see them based on the upvotes)**\n\n**Apparently a lot of news came out YESTERDAY aside from the** [Moderna vaccine rollout](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-japan-moderna/modernas-covid-19-given-to-first-japanese-volunteer-as-takeda-starts-trial-idUSKBN29Q0NI) **in Japan which will be led by Takeda (which is why I figured the stock popped a little)**:\n\n1. [Japanese Ministry of Health approved Takeda's drug for ALUNBRIG for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer](https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2021/manufacturing-and-marketing-approval-received-in-japan-for-alunbrig-in-the-treatment-of-alk-fusion-gene-positive-unresectable-advanced-or-recurrent-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/) = big revenue tendies from this.\n2. Commenters also found this - a drug called ***Colchicine*** was found to **REDUCE** **\"by 21% the risk of death or hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 compared to placebo\"** ([study here](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/23/2163109/0/en/Colchicine-reduces-the-risk-of-COVID-19-related-complications.html)). This was article was literally released **YESTERDAY** by the Montreal Heart Institute (Our fellow Canadians), but seems like the study was a small study (4200 patients) so I wouldn't get too much hopes up until more research is done. **HOWEVER, WHO OWNS COLCHICINE?? OR SHOULD I SAY** ***COLCRYS***??? [**FUCKING TAKEDA**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchicine#Marketing_exclusivity_in_the_United_States). And you can see it too in their Quarterly/Annual reports as one of their drugs in their GI business that is used to treat gout. **The patent for this expires February 10, 2029.** Aka...if more studies are done on the efficacy of Colchicine on COVID - this is another **INSANE** revenue bagger as treatments for COVID are heavily needed to reduce hospital stress - BUT, like I said, we shouldn't get our hopes up too much until more research/studies come out for it.\n   1. I just found this too but there are other companies that have Colchicine products. Takeda has been in a lawsuit with [Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC](https://www.mdedge.com/rheumatology/article/96726/rheumatology/court-allows-generic-colchicine-enter-market?sso=true) (its generic called *Mitigare)* for patent infringement but lost. Avion Pharmaceutical LLC also has a Colchicine generic called *Gloperba* but doesn't seem to have been in any lawsuit with Takeda regarding this.

word)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Preface</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let me start by saying that I am a longtime lurker and slightly retarded. I am terrible at explaining things whether that be irl or on the internet, but I&#39;ll try my best...</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not trying to take away the hype from GME, BB, or PLTR, but just would like to share a stock you should keep on your radar <strong>that I feel</strong> could easily double (or triple) in the next coming years.</p>\n\n<p><strong>FWIW:</strong> I am currently BB gang with 1200+ shares at a cost basis of 12.52. This is everything I got in my Roth IRA aside from $600 worth of $T that I bought when I was a boomer investor thinking dividends were cool when I&#39;m only 23. I refuse to sell it because it&#39;s down by $1 and I refuse to sell at a loss...like I said...I&#39;m retarded.</p>\n\n<p>Obligatory x10 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 to signify how much BB will multiply by.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Intro</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Takeda Pharmaceutical Company</strong> <strong>($TAK), currently trading at $18.13 as of 1/22 close</strong>. Yes, I know what you&#39;re thinking:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>&quot;This company is old as shit&quot; (240 years to be exact), and</li>\n<li>&quot;Fuck Biopharmaceuticals/Biotech companies, I&#39;ve always gotten burned&quot;</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Well, after what&#39;s transpired with $GME and $BB gang, we know that no matter what, an &quot;old&quot; company can have a big future if they set themselves up correctly with a competitive advantage. <strong>AND</strong> stop trying to play earnings/binary events and just <strong>buy and hold shares</strong>. Less stress, less autism, guaranteed money if the business is solid.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How Did this Company Catch My Eye?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Simply put, because of our <strong>GILF and Savior, Cathie Woods.</strong> So how does Mama Woods play into this? <strong>If you subscribe to ARK&#39;s trade notifications</strong> (I only started as of 12/15/20)<strong>, take a look at how often TAK appears as a &quot;BUY&quot; since the beginning of December 2020 for their ARKG ETF.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t know? You can use <a href=\"https://cathiesark.com/arkg-holdings-of-tak\">Cathie&#39;s Ark</a> to see if for yourself...or look at this &quot;TAK Tracker&quot; I update now and then:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ow3jevyou5d61.png?width=399&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb31a53d09e167bba7d8162524a6ce9f9063b265\">https://preview.redd.it/ow3jevyou5d61.png?width=399&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb31a53d09e167bba7d8162524a6ce9f9063b265</a></p>\n\n<p>ARKG/Cathie increased her holdings <strong>from 2.71m shares on 12/7/20, to over 17m shares as of 1/22/21. That&#39;s ~15m shares of constant BUY in just 1.5 months.</strong></p>\n\n<p>When I first looked at how much TAK was in ARKG&#39;s ETF, it was sitting in the 19th spot in their fund. <strong>Now it&#39;s 14th, and I can see it creeping into their Top 10 IF substantial buys continue at this rate</strong>. ARKG continues to exponentially buy on typical down days, <strong>but even after the ~5% rise</strong> as of 1/22 due to <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moderna-announces-first-participant-dosed-140000002.html\">Moderna vaccine news</a>, <strong>they still bought</strong> <strong>1.6 million shares</strong>. That&#39;s enough confirmation on my holdings to know this shit is \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 to the moon in the long-term.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is So Good about Takeda that Warrants Us to Care?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The value investor noob in me did what little of you retards care to do, and it&#39;s called reading their Quarterly/Annual reports and their Investor Relations presentation/website. Idk about y&#39;all, but something about their <a href=\"https://www.takeda.com/4ab331/siteassets/system/investors/quarterly-announcements/fy2020/qr2020_q2_p01_en.pdf\">Q2 Investor Presentation</a> gives me insane hardness, that \ud83d\udc8e&#39;s can&#39;t compete. Let me show y&#39;all some things I like:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2lcq5f6zu5d61.png?width=1270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8f9c45b8cfd4fd0d9119d3f927abd2f0300d017\">This is the confidence I like to see from a company even despite COVID fucking everyone in the ass rn.</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tiq81mk1v5d61.png?width=1276&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec77de7cf948b0050ebd9488f35e215f28faca13\">Main things I like: Resilient Global Brands Portfolio despite COVID, Raising guidance and forecasts in the upcoming year, TAK-721 catalyst, and insane drug pipeline in the next year and decade (2030).</a></p>\n\n<p>And also, look at their planned drug pipeline in the next decade:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/p0whjov2v5d61.png?width=1274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d42ebd1b6a9e294020f7ed80182dfe42420849e1\">https://preview.redd.it/p0whjov2v5d61.png?width=1274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d42ebd1b6a9e294020f7ed80182dfe42420849e1</a></p>\n\n<p>If you also read that Q2 presentation linked above, you&#39;ll see that all the planned objectives Takeda has outlined for the prior 2020 year...which they have met (slide 10 &amp; 11). With how good and smart management has been thus far, I am very confident that they will be able to deliver a majority, if not all, of their objectives regarding their future drug pipeline in the second half of the year.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Takeda <strong>publicly</strong> comes out and states that <strong>they plan to increase their revenue</strong> <a href=\"https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2021/takeda-provides-pipeline-update-and-shares-goal-to-increase-revenue-50-percent-by-fy2030-at-the-39th-annual-jp-morgan-healthcare-conference/#:%7E:text=Highly%20Innovative%20Pipeline%20Supports%20Sustained%20Growth&amp;text=Takeda&#x27;s%20pipeline%20portfolio%20has%20the,representing%2050%25%20growth%20from%20FY2019\">50% by FY2030</a>. That&#39;s some big balls of confidence coming from their management...I like that...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Orphan Drug Market Potential</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you look at a lot of the drugs in their upcoming pipeline, you&#39;ll see a lot of them have that &quot;Red Chromosome&quot; icon next to them. According to the legend at the bottom, that means that these drugs have &quot;Orphan Potential in at least one indication&quot;. I was a Biology major in college, but still only know that the &quot;Mitochondria is the Powerhouse of the Cell&quot; ...<em>for fucks sake.</em></p>\n\n<p>Regardless, what does this mean? Look at this <a href=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/orphan-drugs-market-100088\">random ass article</a> I Googled about &quot;Orphan Drug Market Potential&quot; and see what it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The global orphan drug market size <strong>was valued at USD 151.00 billion in 2019</strong> <strong>and is projected to reach USD 340.84 billion by 2027, exhibiting a CAGR of 10.5% during the forecast period</strong>&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The graph they included displays it nicely for you autists who can&#39;t read:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4sl3b0slv5d61.png?width=630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aecc0215a27d39e7303b13e424bba963ed75c91\">Aka, by 2027, the Orphan Drug Market Size is going up bigly</a></p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s a x$3 billion increase in market size from now until 2027, and I believe Takeda is capitalizing on it heavily. I forgot to mention too...the title of that article seems to mainly state that it&#39;s in therapy areas of <strong>Oncology,</strong> Hematology, <strong>Neurology</strong>, Endocrinology, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>It seems like I forgot to mention again, that Takeda has <strong>5 business segments they R&amp;D and develop drugs for: Oncology, Gastrointestinal, Neuroscience</strong>, Rare-Diseases, and <strong>Plasma Derived Therapy</strong>. Needless to say, I think that Takeda is primed for this market potential especially with their current drug track record and drug portfolio. All of this = <strong>hella revenue</strong> <strong>generation</strong>\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8 .</p>\n\n<p><strong>Plasma Therapy Market</strong></p>\n\n<p>One thing everyone can unanimously agree on this past year is that COVID can piss off. However, in terms of Pharma companies, the usage and development of plasma therapy still seems relatively infantile and untapped. Especially after seeing the beneficial use cases of <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/convalescent-plasma-therapy/about/pac-20486440\">Plasma Therapy as a treatment for COVID</a>, I figure that more and more companies will try and develop significant uses utilizing plasma.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I noticed reading Takeda&#39;s Q2 presentation was this:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/pss81ms5w5d61.png?width=552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa48efda97dfd804ada664b280227145e631ccf0\">Found on Slide 27, talking about PDT Immunology growth for their PDT portfolio</a></p>\n\n<p>It seems like Takeda has already <strong>established</strong> a footprint of Plasma Collection centers <strong>globally</strong> and is on track to invest &amp; develop <strong>MORE</strong> plasma collection centers <strong>by 2024</strong>. I might also be retarded, but look at how they also say &quot;increase...manufacturing capacity&quot;; meaning that they <strong>not only</strong> plan on <strong>collecting</strong> plasma, but also developing and manufacturing PDT (Plasma Derived Therapy) products <strong>all in house</strong> (vertical integration seems to be analogous).</p>\n\n<p>Once again, look at <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/08/2141427/0/en/Global-Plasma-Therapy-Market-to-Garner-Revenue-of-178-2-million-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-16-3-by-2026-despite-the-Covid-19-Crisis-Exclusive-Report-150-Pages-by-Research-Dive.html#:%7E:text=Filings%20Media%20Partners-,Global%20Plasma%20Therapy%20Market%20to%20Garner%20Revenue%20of%20%24178.2%20million,150%20Pages%5D%20by%20Research%20Dive\">this random article</a> I found detailing the potential growth of the Plasma Therapy Market. They say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Plasma therapy market...the market is anticipated to harbor revenue of $432.8 million, increasing from a market size of $131.9 million in the year 2018, with a CAGR of 16.3% in forecast period.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And even better, <a href=\"https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/plasma-therapy-market.html\">this site</a> listing who the &quot;<strong>KEY Players Operating in the GLOBAL Plasma Therapy Market&quot;</strong> are. Here&#39;s a hint:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/n6p6u65iw5d61.png?width=405&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fbc948307ee3644a89790f0fb13fe799cbb49dc\">Obligatory \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80</a></p>\n\n<p>Once again, this is big market potential that Takeda has positioned themselves at the forefront. Not only are they collecting plasma, but also moving towards developing PDT products all in house. And if other companies/hospitals, want plasma to use/study with, Takeda will be there, ahead of its peers, distributing that plasma and collecting that insane revenue.</p>\n\n<p>Side note: Their PDT portfolio/efforts took a hit this year due to patients not coming into their collection centers due to COVID.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Undervalued as FUARRKKKKKKK Compared to It&#39;s Competitors</strong></p>\n\n<p>As much as we like to shit on Seeking Beta for their shitty tactics to stray GME Astronauts from Mars, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4397133-takeda-gracefully-navigating-covid-storm\">this article</a> talking about how Takeda navigated the COVID downturn with their drug resilient portfolio aligns with what I like, therefore, I approve.</p>\n\n<p>Look at <a href=\"https://craft.co/takeda-pharmaceutical/competitors\">other companies</a> in the same space as Takeda, which the article lays out simple enough for my smooth brain:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/etgsyx9qw5d61.png?width=572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8032cc9ab9612b2a853ffafd80dd65ebcbf6a9e\">Stolen from the article so it might not be 100&#37; accurate since they posted it (Jan 4).</a></p>\n\n<p>Takeda has a muchhhhhh smaller market cap than a lot of it&#39;s competitors, but seems to be better positioned in the upcoming future and doing much better in all other aspects. Idk...seems undervalued to me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other Good Shit I Like</strong></p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t realize DD (whether good or bad) takes this long to write...but I&#39;m starting to get tired and realizing that I spent a few hours of my weekend doing this.</p>\n\n<p>I won&#39;t go into too much crazy detail, but I&#39;ll list other things I like about Takeda (latest updates can be seen on their <a href=\"https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2020/takeda-fy2020-h1-results-demonstrate-portfolio-resilience-confirms-full-year-management-guidance--raises-forecasts-for-free-cash-flow-reported-op--reported-eps/\">Q2 press release</a>):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>They continue to strategically divest non-core assets of their business.</strong> They profited ~$11.3 billion dollars from their divestitures which <strong>exceeded</strong> their $10 billion dollar divestiture goal from 2020. This will help them deleverage their net debt/adjusted EBITDA to x2 from their current ~x3.8, at a faster pace if they can keep this up.</li>\n<li><strong>Shire plc.</strong> <strong>acquisition will prove to be more bigly than people think.</strong> This deal was recently finalized (2019) and with that came some debt from Shire. Financial reports + COVID, will make their reporting look icky, but their resilient revenue from their current drug portfolio will keep the money rolling until conditions start getting better. I think Shire will help strengthen Takeda&#39;s R&amp;D and global presence much more than people think.</li>\n<li><strong>Catalysts in the 2021 year seems to be for</strong> <a href=\"https://www.takeda.com/en-us/newsroom/news-releases/2020/u.s.-food-and-drug-administration-accepts-new-drug-application-for-review/\"><strong>TAK-721</strong></a><strong>.</strong> If it gets the thumbs up from FDA, this product will be a fat revenue generator as it is &quot;the first FDA-approved treatment for the chronic inflammatory disease&quot; of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Meaning....any of the hundreds of thousands of people affected by this will be prescribed this by the docs = <strong>money bagger</strong>.\n\n<ol>\n<li>Also, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moderna-announces-first-participant-dosed-140000002.html\">COVID Vaccine news from Moderna</a> is what caused the stock to jump 5% yesterday. Takeda will be the head honchos running the vaccine trials/rollout in Japan...so...that seems like good news to me.</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><strong>LEAPS are cheap as fuck</strong> (maybe for a bad reason). Reasonable price points though like 20c-25c are still able to be hit especially with all these catalysts coming out for Takeda in the coming years. <strong>Cheaper leaps = less hurt when you lose &amp; more potential upside!!!!</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>CONS</strong></p>\n\n<p>Can&#39;t complete a DD without listing some cons..</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Expiring patents + Generics + Drug Development</strong>. Like with any drug, its patent expires. Therefore, generics will dive into the market, undercutting anymore potential revenue that Takeda could make off it&#39;s older drugs. Essentially, you have to be confident if Takeda can continue to develop new drugs to continue churning in revenue before their patents run out.</li>\n<li><strong>Politics.</strong> IDK much about this shit, but I figure with Democrats at the lead of everything and them wanting healthcare to be more affordable, the big wigs in politics will pass laws that might make it so pharma companies &amp; Takeda will have to lower their prices (=less revenue).</li>\n<li><strong>FDA + Drug Approvals</strong>. Like I mentioned before, don&#39;t try and play binary events with biotechs. Like others have probably experienced, you&#39;ll get burned. But you can&#39;t forget, the FDA and other Drug Departments for other countries have to actually <strong>approve</strong> the drug in their country in order for it to even be sold. There&#39;s the risk here that their drugs won&#39;t get approved, therefore, can&#39;t be sold/will have to go back to the drawing board to get it approved. The delays might cost them.</li>\n<li><strong>This stock doesn&#39;t move</strong>. Volume is shit for the stock and also note that even though the company came out saying it&#39;ll increase it&#39;s revenue by 50% by 2030, the stock basically went <strong>down/didn&#39;t move</strong>. Either investors are busy jerking to other stocks to not care, or that they don&#39;t think it&#39;ll happen until it shows up on the balance sheets.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: If I learned anything this far in life, it&#39;s if you think you can do something well, there&#39;s always an Asian who can do it better. Cathie has realized this and doubled down as Takeda is the only Asian/Japanese company in the ARKG holdings. Therefore Takeda = \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Positions: 150 Shares &amp; 18 25c 2022 LEAPS (I&#39;m poor)</p>\n\n<p>End note: I&#39;m not saying you <strong>NEED</strong> to get in now....just keep it on your radar for a potentially undervalued stock that has a lot of upside in the next decade.</p>\n\n<p>Note bene: I&#39;ve been in conversations before where people said, &quot;Why not just invest in ARKG if you like Cathie so much??&quot; or that investing in ARKG is easier. <strong>Well I could, but I&#39;m autistic</strong>. Plus, I like holding individual stocks and getting its dividend, and the thought of expense ratios taking some of my monies makes me flaccid \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit #1 1/23/21, 22:34:</strong> <strong>Yes this stock is flat/declining as fuck.</strong> It&#39;s one of the cons I mentioned above. Don&#39;t be expecting rapid growth in a few months, it could be a <strong>few years</strong> (I told you I was autistic). <strong>However, some reason I don&#39;t buy the whole &quot;Cash Park&quot; in ARKG just due to the influx of money going into the fund.</strong> <strong><em>WE&#39;RE retarded, but Cathie (ARK) isn&#39;t.</em></strong> Her whole narrative is investing in disruptive technology. TF is the point in parking ALL that cash in Takeda when there&#39;s a bunch of other holdings in ARKG she could put putting it towards? I&#39;m fully convinced they know something we don&#39;t/don&#39;t see just yet. Especially for what Takeda has presented THUS FAR (Q2 presentation was October 29)...it just looks too good to be priced at what it currently is. Solid drug pipeline, big global presence, albeit soft on the financials - but I&#39;m confident it&#39;ll turn around by next earnings report, or at least show better horizons.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other stuff people in the comments have pointed out are very valid though to consider as part of your DD on whether to get into this stock (I reckon you should be able to see them based on the upvotes)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Apparently a lot of news came out YESTERDAY aside from the</strong> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-japan-moderna/modernas-covid-19-given-to-first-japanese-volunteer-as-takeda-starts-trial-idUSKBN29Q0NI\">Moderna vaccine rollout</a> <strong>in Japan which will be led by Takeda (which is why I figured the stock popped a little)</strong>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2021/manufacturing-and-marketing-approval-received-in-japan-for-alunbrig-in-the-treatment-of-alk-fusion-gene-positive-unresectable-advanced-or-recurrent-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/\">Japanese Ministry of Health approved Takeda&#39;s drug for ALUNBRIG for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</a> = big revenue tendies from this.</li>\n<li>Commenters also found this - a drug called <strong><em>Colchicine</em></strong> was found to <strong>REDUCE</strong> <strong>&quot;by 21% the risk of death or hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 compared to placebo&quot;</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/23/2163109/0/en/Colchicine-reduces-the-risk-of-COVID-19-related-complications.html\">study here</a>). This was article was literally released <strong>YESTERDAY</strong> by the Montreal Heart Institute (Our fellow Canadians), but seems like the study was a small study (4200 patients) so I wouldn&#39;t get too much hopes up until more research is done. <strong>HOWEVER, WHO OWNS COLCHICINE?? OR SHOULD I SAY</strong> <strong><em>COLCRYS</em></strong>??? <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchicine#Marketing_exclusivity_in_the_United_States\"><strong>FUCKING TAKEDA</strong></a>. And you can see it too in their Quarterly/Annual reports as one of their drugs in their GI business that is used to treat gout. <strong>The patent for this expires February 10, 2029.</strong> Aka...if more studies are done on the efficacy of Colchicine on COVID - this is another <strong>INSANE</strong> revenue bagger as treatments for COVID are heavily needed to reduce hospital stress - BUT, like I said, we shouldn&#39;t get our hopes up too much until more research/studies come out for it.\n\n<ol>\n<li>I just found this too but there are other companies that have Colchicine products. Takeda has been in a lawsuit with <a href=\"https://www.mdedge.com/rheumatology/article/96726/rheumatology/court-allows-generic-colchicine-enter-market?sso=true\">Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC</a> (its generic called <em>Mitigare)</em> for patent infringement but lost. Avion Pharmaceutical LLC also has a Colchicine generic called <em>Gloperba</em> but doesn&#39;t seem to have been in any lawsuit with Takeda regarding this. (courtesy of <a href=\"/u/nicoco3890\">u/nicoco3890</a> for this find below) - regardless, this means MONEY if Colchicine holds true towards its efficacy.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON
