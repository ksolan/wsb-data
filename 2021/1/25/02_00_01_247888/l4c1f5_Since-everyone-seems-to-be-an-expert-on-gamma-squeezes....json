{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "OP for this post is https://www.reddit.com/user/infinitelimits00/ and he posted this on r/options\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the reverse gamma squeeze (should also really be known as a charm-gamma squeeze)...plus this is an r/options sub anyways so might as well introduce charm.\n\nSo I see a lot of people think they know what a gamma squeeze is lately from GME. And yea what most people are saying is correct, but what they don\u2019t understand is gamma works in two directions. The defining feature of any stock that has undergone a \u201ctrue\u201d gamma + short combo squeeze is that when it drops, it NEVER makes a V-shape recovery. See KODK, QS, HTZ, NKLA, TLRY from years ago, even BYND from years ago. I mostly like to go long stocks since stocks usually go up anyways, but I do like calling tops of stocks for fun (see my post history - I got QS exactly right and HTZ by 1 day, also got ZM and SNOW perfectly right in my comments history). I\u2019m not calling the top for GME, but I just want to introduce the concept of what happens when a gamma squeeze fails, since the reverse is nasty.\n\nSo the gamma squeeze idea that most people have is say the next week the 100 GME call is like 20 delta (just estimating to make it easier). If some random person bought a 20 delta call from a MM, the MM will buy 20 shares to stay delta neutral and this happens over and over again over the course of the day, and the idea is this will cause the stock to skyrocket if enough people buy these calls. However, here\u2019s the part that\u2019s important. If some news came out or if just GME never moves much, those calls decay in delta, called charm. So those 20 delta calls -> 0 delta and the MM has to then SELL back those 20 shares, suppressing the stock. The delta of options change with time too, not only with underlying price.\n\nThat is one problem people never mention when they think gamma squeezes or an infinite cycle. But the other real issue is MM are already short ITM calls which they have like close to +100 shares hedged agains those short nearly 100 delta calls per option. If the stock ever dropped through these long call strikes, those calls go from nearly 100 delta at one point to < 50 delta, which means MM need to sell 50+ shares/options to keep delta neutral. They would keep selling more and more if it continues to drop and stays below those previously long strikes. That\u2019s often times why the downside puts are so expensive on these names because MM also can\u2019t blindly sell those, known a reverse gamma squeeze would cause these stocks to potentially go down 20% in a day.\n\nAnyhow, I wanted to explain the reverse gamma squeeze since gamma is bidirectional. This is why when stocks that undergo this gamma + short squeeze rise and then suddenly drop, they NEVER recover. How many zig-zag recoveries have you seen in these stocks? That\u2019s actually the defining feature of a stock that has undergone a gamma squeeze. It\u2019s when it reverse gamma squeezes, it\u2019s over. Good luck with your GME plays. Like I said, I like calling tops just for fun since it\u2019s more interesting anyways. I\u2019ve done it with a bunch of names in the past. I don\u2019t really have a feel for GME, but the only thing I know is if it ever has a big down day, it\u2019s most likely over and you\u2019ll actually rather sell that day then baghold or buy the dip (which goes against the conventional thinking, but is actually the defining characteristic for true gamma squeeze stocks).\n\nEdit.\n\nP.S.\n\nI know one thing retailers are winning now but most will get hurt badly. I heard so many times this time and situation is different time after time but the end result is always the same. If anything retailers are going provide huge opportunity to make a lot more on this by shorting this at the exhaustion point when there aren\u2019t any buyers left. Remember they have more tools at their disposal than the average joe. I don\u2019t mean to bash anyone here bulls make money bears make money pigs get slaughtered. After this episode market makers seen the hands of all the poker players so if the retail investors try to pull off another gamma squeeze, market makers and other big players will simply will take the other side of the trade and create a panic selling and eventually all the stops will be taken out all the way back to 40-45 first. So be-careful chasing GME here. Companies like Macy\u2019s have 4 times more revenues and sell 4 times more products every hours on e-commerce than GME but fundamentals matter so that\u2019s why it\u2019s trading at the multiple it\u2019s trading at now. At the end of the day fundamentals matter. Whoever started this game already made the money and is probably out already now someone will get hurt badly.
