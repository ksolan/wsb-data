{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I know you retards are probably thinking about the boner you will get seeing your GME gains tomorrow.\n\nIn past few days, I have seen backlash in media regarding Reddit investor. Also, I have seen some self-proclaimed financial advisors making posts in WSB or other forums. I have nothing against this. The point is clear \"Institutions are not particularly happy with the rise of retard investors\". \n\nLets talk about market valuation. In my retarded option, it is arbitrary. It's not like Newton's third law which is valid  everywhere.  The arbitrary nature of market valuation has been  proven very well in 2020. An example: Tesla (WSB's favorite stock in 2020) was valued at **80B** or less a year ago. Now it\u2019s valued at 800B. I am doing my PhD in Electrical Engineering. And, I understood the value in Tesla\u2019s technology when I bought the stock in 2019. Not just me, my colleagues in other automakers did too. But, there was so much opposition from the so called analyst. Most of them called it overvalued in the prices in the beginning of 2020. I sold at the beginning of 2020 after I made 80% gain (paper hand I know). After seeing the rise of Tesla, I have become wary of listening to financial analyst on valuation of a company. Sure, retail investors don\u2019t have the money to move the market unless in exceptional cases like GME, Tesla etc. Therefore, we have no choice but to follow the analyst.\n\nIt is true that institutions do have more data. But, I have to come to the conclusion that they are as clueless as the next person when it comes to valuation. Valuation in the market is more like **faith (**I am not religious). The valuation of a company is defined by what the big institutions believe it should be. It doesn\u2019t matter what model you use for valuation or how deep your understanding of the underlying product/service/technology. \n\nThese big institutions have a bunch of retard called Analyst. In most cases, these analyst are not necessarily expert in the technology they are evaluating e.g. Tesla. Their job is to form a compelling argument to justify their own price targets. Why? Because the firm they work for has most likely invested in the stock and want the price to move up. The same way, when they sell it or have taken profit, they down grade it to create the next entry point. So, these analyst are basically trying to manipulate the prices. And, they have been able to do that because they manage large amount of money.\n\nWhy the institution are angry now? The market volatility has increased. Look at valuations of stocks in 2020. What happened in 2020? COVID. Yes. Also, retail investors started influencing market and a lot of them stopped listening to financial analyst. Why is that bad? Because, big institutions have been controlling the market for decades. They were happy when retail investors just bought ETFs or mutual funds etc. and let the big guys control the market. \n\nThe rise of WSB and retail investors coming together for a stock has created uncertainty in the market. There are narrative now that this has made the market irrational ( some guy posted this in one of the reddit forum). Total bullshit. Now, imagine how the bosses of these analyst feel, when they are sitting with shit load of data and telling they should not buy a stock because they think it should be valued at X. Then, comes a bunch of retards who buy OTM calls and cause gamma squeeze and price shoots up. It makes the analyst and the institution look like bunch of fools. If this trend continues, institution will loose their grip in the market and more people may choose to manage their own money instead of handing it to institutions. \n\nTLDR: Don't always believe analyst or people who claim they have X years of experience when it comes to valuation. Don't out rightly dismiss them either. So, if someone says GME should be valued at X, it does not mean they are right. Believe in your play.
