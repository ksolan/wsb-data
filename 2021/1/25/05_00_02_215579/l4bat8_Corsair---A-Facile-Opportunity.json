{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Hello there Autists and Retards alike,\n\nIt is time to finally make a post about a quite certainly facile opportunity. \n\nRecently many retards who did not want to pay foolish prices for a console have decided to be part of the growing PC gaming industry. Since its founding in 1994, Corsair has shipped more than 190 million gaming and streaming products and is actively nurturing a passionate and engaged global customer base by maintaining a long history of delivering durable, reliably engineered products that have expanded the frontiers of gaming performance. As a result, Corsair has established itself as a leading brand among gamer retards and streamers, many of whom are active and prominent in eSports and act as ambassadors for its branded gear.\n\nThe global gaming PC and streaming gear markets, including peripherals, components, and prebuilt PCs and laptops specifically designed for PC gaming, totaled approximately $36 billion in 2019. Of which Corsair has a 41.9% market share in the PC components department and an 18.3% peripheral market-share.\n\nMany keep comparing this stock to Logitech which in one way makes sense; they both sell keyboards, headsets, and mice for PCs. However, don\u2019t forget the part that Corsair is MOSTLY known for their top-tier PC components. That is; cases, power supplies, cooling systems (fans), RAM, and storage. Do not fear, for I will talk more about this later.\n\n# Subsidiaries\n\n**Elgato** \\- Corsair owns Elgato which creates the most desired streaming products, some even being necessities. Elgato does not only offer products for steamers but also for YouTubers and filmmakers. They offer a wide variety of products to produce high-quality videos. Which similar to Corsair itself, Elgato is one of the best, if not the best, at what it does in its industry.\n\n**Scuff Gaming** \\- Scuff Gaming is a creator of high-performance gaming controllers, providing superior accessories and customized gaming controllers for consoles and PC that are used by top professional gamers as well as casual gamers. \n\nScuff has an iron grip on the 3rd party controller market. Scuff is the only real name brand company that makes comfortable and quality 3rd party controllers. Unlike Corsair there is much less high-level competition in this space. Most professional console gamers use Scuff due to its superiority over a normal controller.\n\n**Origin PC** \\- Corsair offers even more through their subsidiary Origin PCs. Origin offers some great value for money prebuilt PCs because they can secure exclusive deals with Corsair as it is its parent company. Although the prebuilt PC market is very over-saturated, Origin being endorsed by the likes of PewDiePie should make you feel a little bit better.\n\n# What Earnings Could Look Like\n\nThere's no way to understate this, Santa delivered a shit ton of PCs, headsets, keyboards, and mice. Even for the ones who didn't get anything PC related, I can tell you with certainty that a lot of kids who got consoles also got Scuff controllers. Now let's do some math, Corsair's main competitor Logitech had an average increase in earnings from the pre-Oct. quarter to the Christmas quarter of 1.42x throughout the past 2 years. So, if we use this as a base for what we can expect since Corsair had a 457M revenue quarter last period, we could be expecting a 651M quarter, assuming it keeps the same Operating Income/Total Revenue ratio compared to Corsair's last quarter, about 1:10, this would put this quarter's Operating Income at 65.1M. All that is left to find this quarter's EPS is to divide the Operating Income by outstanding shares, and since Corsair has a 91.87M Outstanding Shares avg. 65.1M / 91.87M leaves us with a EPS of 0.70. Since the EPS estimate is 0.43, we'd again almost be doubling it.\n\nLast earnings report, there was a 20% 8-day run-up to ER. With most likely similar estimate destruction, we could expect Corsair to hit a minimum of $46.2 by Feb. 9.\n\n# Competition\n\nRight now Corsair's biggest peripheral competitor is Logitech, which boasts a market cap of **17.535B** barely earns 1/4th of its market cap each year. On the other hand, Corsair's annual earnings so far sit at about 2/5 of its 3.5B market cap, leaving Corsair a lot of room to grow left. For now, Logitech only really dabbles in the peripheral business, while Corsair makes 74% of its guala from PC components. \n\nI ate too many tendies so I'm not writing anymore.\n\n# Positions\n\nI currently hold 2/19 50c and some shares.\n\nGet in on this \ud83d\ude80to tendy town so you can finally give your wife's boyfriend his phone back.", "author_fullname": "t2_8jlxu7zc", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "Corsair - A Facile Opportunity", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_l4bat8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 66, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 66, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_2": 1}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1611562213.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello there Autists and Retards alike,</p>\n\n<p>It is time to finally make a post about a quite certainly facile opportunity. </p>\n\n<p>Recently many retards who did not want to pay foolish prices for a console have decided to be part of the growing PC gaming industry.
