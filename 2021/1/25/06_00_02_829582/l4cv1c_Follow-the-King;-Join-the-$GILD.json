{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Hello my buddies! It is our favorite time of the week-Tendie Time-and today we will be examining the next big thang, Gilead Sciences, or $GILD. Most of you are surely familiar with the Remdesivir producer, but it's recent foray into cancer therapeutics and drugs telegraphs a likely big move being an acquisition by Roche the leader in all cancer drugs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, of course we take everything some random user shouts on here with a grain of salt. So, I made sure to bring a mountain of DD done by some true autist. I will provide links and breakdown each in case you're just a lazy fuck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLink to 5 parts of Roche merger with GILD theory:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.griproom.com/gilead-and-roche-merger-theory](https://www.griproom.com/gilead-and-roche-merger-theory)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Part One: It looks like Gilead is about to Merge with Roche\\*\\*\n\nThis starts with some background on the playout of the market as Covid-19 began unraveling. How the idea to repurpose Remdesivir could lead to benefits and this dude flipped 50k to 1.5 mm. Unfortunately some shit got leaked and sent the stock spiraling, but in the end Remdesivir was shown to shorten hospital stays by 5 days which is pretty huge\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, the autistic shit in this part is an evaluation of revenue to market caps of peers in the biotech industry.\n\nJohnson n Johnson:\n\nMarket cap: 406\n\nRevenue: 82\n\nR to MC: 20%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRoche\n\nMC: 300\n\nR: 61.5\n\nR2MC: 23%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNovartis\n\n207\n\n48.5\n\n23\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMerck\n\n201\n\n47\n\n23.3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPfizer\n\n210\n\n52\n\n24.7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbbott\n\n193\n\n32\n\n16.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmgen\n\n133\n\n23\n\n17.2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbbVie\n\n184\n\n33\n\n18\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAstraZeneca\n\n133.7\n\n24.4\n\n20.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEli Lilly\n\n163\n\n22.3\n\n13.7\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Gilead Sciences\\*\\*\n\nMarket Cap: 74\n\nRevenue: 22.5\n\nR to MC: 30.4%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat does this mean? That GILD is the most undervalued of all its peers. If they do as good as last year, the R2MC goes to 31.3. Sales of tecartus, yescarta and trodelvy are supposed to go up though and the higher it goes the more ripe it is to get boughtout just like GME is a steal at 60 and goin to 420.69 for a blaze out before 1000, but I digress. Once this gets to 40% a buyout at 100% premium is solid. GILD also has Kite, Forty Seven, Arcus, and Immunomedics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome facts are shown about how current CEO worked 30 years at Roche type of shit. How Roche is world leader in cancer treatment and worked with all these companies that Gilead proceeded to buyout. This is important because Gilead could buy these companies for cheaper because they smaller than Roche and therefore Roche acquires them cheaper. Just good ol fashioned business practices or some shit I guess.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe cool thing is that 80% of the stock is owned by institutions so is has that infinity squeeze vibe type of feel to it. This is also super relevant because the pandemic is causing a backup of cancer diagnoses and so cancer drugs are going to be booming for awhile. If GILD were priced like its peers itd be at 90+ points. A merger could be expected to be priced around 120$.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Part 2: Gilead is the Next Celgene\\*\\*\n\nThis is the craziest part about all this shit. These people are getting caught manipulating GILD using the same stocktwits and yahoo finance accounts they used to shit on Celgene in fall of 2018 before its buyout by Bristol-Myers. The deal took years to pull off and GILD checks all the same boxes like 52 week lows and losers on stocktwits calling their management dumb and the stock just never following the broad index or responding to good news.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis parts definitely worth a check cause he found all the lame comments of people trying to manipulate the price. They use this trick called the anchoring effect. For example sale 50$ (reg price 95). \"Ill buy that stock at 50\". Just shit these astroturfers try to do to fuck with us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese two companies are basically the same story so the same players that were involved with Celgene could be in charge of merger here with Roche n $GILD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Part 3: Signs that Gilead and Roche are Reading our Merger Articles\\*\\*\n\nHere, the guy figures out that executives are going through from $GILD and Roche reading his stuff. His buddy helps him sifon through the data to establish statistical anomalies like lil Foster City Cali having a ton of views like top 5 and its one of smallest cities in cali. There's also ties to a bunch of other cities and executive headquarter location type of stuff. Even in fuckin Canada.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Part 4: Gilead is Insanely Undervalued\\*\\*\n\nGilead just plummeted last six months of 2020 and never responded to good news anymore. Roche is chugging away. As their marketvalues keep growing apart it makes it even more plausible. Again, 80% owned by fuckin institutions that just gotta sit and hold that shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Part 5: Market Cap Spread Between Gilead and Roche Continues to Widen\\*\\*\n\nRoche's current market growth makes it able to sell shares and dilute in order to buyout GILD. Up until Dec 31 2020 GILD kept sinking and sinking. Since GILD is 80% owned by institutions a buyout needs to be very lucrative. All was well until Remdesivir brought the hype train and it spiked the shares to the 80s. This shit couldn't be accepted though so MM fuckers made sure to short it back down the rest of the year to fucking 7 year lows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason they waited till the new year is likely tax related, so this explains why we are seeing current growth these first few weeks into the new year as well as an analyst upgrade by MS to 83. This shit is massively undervalued and its ripe for a short squeeze because 80% owned by institutions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFuck these fuckers who try to steal the game. Let's make some money, gentlemen and gentlewomen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nGILD is being manipulated as fuck and is probably getting boughtout by Roche up to 100 or possible infinity squeeze because 80% institution owned.
