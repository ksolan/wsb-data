I had to pick up a short term sales job just to help pay the bills. \n\nWe had 10,000k sitting in our bank account waiting to be spent on necessities, medical bills, and insurance costs for a recent baby. I vividly remember sitting in front of my computer contemplating my yearly Roth investment and what to do...Max our Roths or pay the bills. At that time, Apple was floating at 100 dollars pre 4-1 split and pre 7-1 split.  Roughly 350,000 worth today. I decided to pay the bills and do what was best for my family at the time. Which was good, but not the best good.\n\nSince 2009 I've made roughly 1.3 million in salary, had three more kids, and not one day goes by that I don't think \"what if\" . Don't get me wrong, I have an amazing wife, life, and seven beautiful kids, but I wonder every day where I could be if I had pulled the Roth trigger. \n\nWe have so much time on our side to catch up from mistakes.\n\nI know there are those who are new here wondering what this is all about. I know you are faced with tough finacial decisions, and all sorts of other stuff, but you having so much time on your side. So 5, 10, 15, 20, years from now do you want to have regrets for not jumping in.  \n\nFOMO is real and the pain of \"what if\" and \"I could have\" is so powerful and heartbreaking that I don't want you to feel the same way.
