{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Firstly, you gotta know that a lot of the float in GME is synthetic long. What is that?\n\nSynthetic shares simplified: Assuming there are only 10 shares and M is the original owner of all the shares. When X short a share. X borrows it and sells it and someone else buys it. If Y is the buyer, Y is also now an owner of a share.\n\nBecause there were only 10 stock to begin with. And because now there are 11 shares in the hands of M and Y. Y's 1 share is a piece of the original share. And M has 1 synthetic share.\n\nNow if you continue that, there is no real limit to how much shares can become synthetic. There could be only 10 shares in existence and synthetics could be 50 shares as it could be shorted again and again.\n\nBut there are some limiting factors for which this sort of scenarios don't happen.\n1. Borrow rate and 2. Selling and buying of shares.\n\nOnce you borrow a share, you gotta pay the cost of borrowing. Now when you are borrowing again and again, the actual shares becomes harder and harder to borrow exponentially and interest rates also increase exponentially. Why?\n\nLets get back to the original scenario. Suppose after X shorted a share, he shorts one more. After first event there was actual borrow ratio of 1/11. After his second short, his borrow ratio is 2/12. Do it again, and you would 3/13. Can you see how the shares shorted linearly leading to crowding of borrowers and the interest increasing exponentially?\n\nNow let's assume, X shorted all of M's shares and if Y bought all of it. So there\u2019s 20 total share owners in the market.\n\nNow, lets say the price of that stock is \u00a3420.69. If M, let's say decides to sell his 5 shares. The broker must provide M with his 5 shares to sell. The broker is on the hook. The broker cannot just buy them. So the broker tells X, \"Bro, you give me back the 5 shares I lent you as  you promised you would return them to me whenever I need them or pay M the money of his 5 shares, like right now.\"\n\nIf X just decides to buy back those 5 shares from M(which is more likely), he is covering. X will pay the M the monetary value of those 5 shares at the market price and destroy those 5 synthetic shares. As a result, M is left with 5 synthetic shares, money worth of 5 shares and Y is still owner of the 10 shares. Whereas X is still short on 5 shares. So, total shares in the market is 15.\n\nBut X have had to pay a heavy price. Because he was forced to buy from M. M priced his shares as high as he could get away with.\n\nThink about it. The case was M selling shares which should have added downward pressure to the stock. Instead it creates an upward momentum since the short is forced to perform open market operation. This is a very illiquid scenario with only 3 fixed participants.\n\nIn reality, if no one is interested in buying, M would have to reduce his share price. This would mean X's plan is successful. He would offer M a price of \u00a3100 to buy back those 5 shares. If M agrees, X profits from this whole ordeal and M loses profit.\n\nShorts in a way, artificially reduce price since them shorting creates excess supply. If X didn\u2019t short the 10 shares in the first place, M would have been able to sell them to Y for higher prices since Y wants to buy it.\n\nBut in a real world scenario, this is unlikely, since there are lots of fancy uses of algorithm to keep the price stable and lots of volume. Market makers, buyers and sellers with differences in motives.\n\nBorrowing cost of X's shorts however would decline. Since previously, he was 10 shares short out of 20 total shares or 50%. Now he is 5 shares short out of 15 or 33%.\n\nI hope you understood somewhat how synthetic shares and their borrowing works?\n\nNow, let's come back to the real world. In case of GME, as long as there\u2019s newer and newer buyers, shorts could just create more synthetic shares and suppress the price. But newer buyers also add an upward momentum to the stock in that if there's more demand then supply, price would rise.\n\nSo this becomes a pretty complex scenario. Shorts paying heavy interest rate based on the latest stock price. They are still shorting and being able to suppress the stock price by increasing supply. But that supply is being eaten up by the insatiable demand of us(retail investors).\nAdd to that gamma hedging by market makers. Scalper bots trying to take opportunity of the slightest movement in price, this becomes a garbled scenario that's pretty hard to explain.\n\nAll I could say is this. Taking into consideration, the additional synthetic shares, I read from [ShortSight](https://www.shortsight.com/short-interest-of-float-2-0/)(a venture from S3 Partners to inform people about this sort of thing) that the real GME Short Interest of float is 60%(very outdated data, probably already changed a lot) but if you take the faulty calculations of float by some vendors, it is close to 200-300%(those are irrelevant).\n\nBut taking that synthetic shares into consideration, a 60% SI of flost is extremely explosive. Explosive to the point that it could not be easily described in words.\n\nThink about this, if for one reason or another, lets say, due to a combination of constant gamma squeeze, Ryan Cohen\u2019s tweeting, good news development of Gamestop etc shorts finally decide to cover. They have to perform an open market operation of unprecedented scale relative to a company's size.\n\n*This is how it will unfold.* A short firm, decides, it\u2019s not worth it any more to keep on bleeding interest payment.\nThey decide to cover. Meaning all the extra synthetic longs that has been created now has to be bought back, paying the synthetic longs their share price.\n\nAll of a sudden, out of 70M short shares there's 65M. Next week there\u2019s 60M.\n\nOther hedge fund sees slowly(5-10% in a week let's say) rising prices and declining short interest. They immediately understand that someone is covering. If they were to remain sitting, they would possibly get margin called at the last 20% of the game.\n\nWhy? Because paper hands will always sell out with the smallest of gains. But there are some people who would not(institutional investors, diamond hands etc). So even though short interest continues to decline the availability of shares that are actively traded actually keeps on getting more and more reduced.\n\nSo they would have to raise their prices to unsustainable levels to actually get to make diamond hands sell. This could get you margin called, which nobody wants. Because if they do, their funds would be finished for good.\n\nUltimately, this becomes a self fulfilling prophesy, fund managers dash to buy shares from the open market. Leading to boom boom boom booom booooom booooooom.\n\nA good analogy of this scenario would be the rush hours at metros. If everyone decided for an orderly exit and entry, no one would have suffered, but since everyone is self interested, everyone suffers. And the longs rake in tendies.\n\nThis however is unlikely to happen if only one or two funds are behind this huge short interest. In that case, they may collude and let prices fall as much as they can, potentially even banking profits. In that case shorts would make an orderly exit and prices wouldn\u2019t rise much, if it rises at all.\n\n*That's it.*\n\nIf you haven\u2019t understood shit, no problem. I don't either. This is my best guess of how things would turn out from recently reading all I can about GME and synthetics.\n\nIf I had to use an even simpler method to describe the whole situation, it is figuratively similar to the fractional reserve banking system. Banks can keep very little money on hand compared to deposits. And they in turn.increase supply of money int the economy, making money cheaper. Fractional banking and synthetic longs could be thought of as the same type of system.\n\nIf suddenly everyone decides to dash for their money in their bank, the bank would immediately default(if there's no central bank). \n\nSimilarly, if for one reason or another, shorts try to cover their positions quickly, they are forced to buy the synthetics they have created at exorbitant price and this further fuels the machine.\n\nNot to mention the various scalper bots, algos, hedge funds, retail traders that take every opportunity of this sort of situation and create further buying pressure and force shorts to cover at more and more worse price.\n\nThis situation could get further exacerbated if the shorts are margin called.\n\nIf the shorts have huge margin(like 10s to 100s of billions) and are able to maintain their margin they may be able to weather the storm and finally cover when this whole ordeal is actually over. Here, their margin is like central bank.", "author_fullname": "t2_7r79rqlg", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How GME shorts will actually cover(a simplified explanation from someone who is still learning)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Discussion"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_l4hidu", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 154, "total_awards_received": 2, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 154, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1611555085.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1611583658.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Firstly, you gotta know that a lot of the float in GME is synthetic long.
