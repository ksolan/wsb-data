Callaway has stated that they will look to expand rapidly with new Top Golf venues post merger. (Hence why they opted to do a share transaction rather then a mix to fund expansion) To put this in perspective, Top Golf only opened 9 venues in the 12 months prior to the merger. They have almost reached their prior years venue growth in the first 3 months post merger.\n\nTop Golf is on track to open 20+ venues in the next 18 months which would represent a 31% increase in venues since merger. Many of these locations will be international, Asia, Dubai, Germany to capitalize on the untapped markets overseas.\n\n**Merger Synergies**\n\n**Brands:**\n\nCallaway's products Ogio, TravisMathew and JackWolfskin brands will be promoted at Top golf locations and will strengthen Callaway's brands. There will be significant growth in merchandise sales and club sales as a result of this merger.\n\n**Used Clubs**\n\nCallaway buys back old sets of clubs from their customers, giving them a credit towards new sets of clubs, and sends/sells the old clubs to be used at Topgolf. This integration will significantly increase the bottom line of Topgolf as they no longer have to purchase clubs from third parties at a premium.\n\n28 million guests that come through the doors each year will have a chance to test out used Callaway clubs. Over 50% of which are newcomers who will most likely opt to purchase the same used brand that they learned on/used at Topgolf. Existing golfers may look to switch their club set to Callaway if they see an improvement in their distance/accuracy. (any golfer knows that you always hit better at the driving range than on the course)\n\n**Overall Market Growth**\n\nThe total number of rounds played in the US increased about 12 percent from 2019. This may not seem like a lot but considering that most courses were shut down until June, this growth in the late summer/fall was the largest growth since the Tiger Craze in 1996.\n\nNovember Play Jumps 57% to Set New Record Rise for 2020 [https://www.thengfq.com/covid-19/](https://www.thengfq.com/covid-19/)\n\nOctober Play was up 32.2 percent over the same month in 2019.\n\nThat followed increases of approximately 14 percent in June, 20 percent in July, 21 percent in August and 26 percent in September.\n\nNGF research shows the number of golfers ages 6 to 17 rose by as much as  20 percent this year. The number of newcomers is close to an all-time high, as is latent demand.\n\nJuniors (6-17) and young adults (18-34) comprise about 35% of all on-course golfers\n\n[https://www.thengfq.com/2020/04/2020-golf-industry-report-available-to-members/](https://www.thengfq.com/2020/04/2020-golf-industry-report-available-to-members/)\n\nGrowth in the market means more people buying clubs, and more golfers attending Topgolf during the offseason or their leisure.\n\n**Newcomer Growth and Callaway's Q4 Earnings**\n\nThere has been an explosion in growth of newcomers golfing in 2020 thanks to the pandemic. Many of which went their first seasons using used clubs and hand me downs from friends. You can bet your mom\u2019s Vicodin that Callaway is going to see a surge in their boxing day sales/black Friday sales as newcomers look to purchase new sets of clubs for their first time. In my group of friends alone we went from having 8 buddies in our regular golf group to over 30 thanks to the pandemic. The first thing most of them did after the golf season ended was purchase a new set of clubs. I am expecting a large beat for Q4 revenues with revenues of $390M+ which would represent a 25% increase from Q42019 and 16% revenue beat on estimates thanks to the influx of first year golfers looking to upgrade their used clubs.\n\n**Callaway's Future**\n\nCallaway has transformed from a small, profitable slow growing company to a large, high growth company and should be valued as such. The next couple years Callaway will be key as they continue to open new venues across the globe and integrate Callaway products in venues. Revenues will grow from $1.75 billion in 2020 to $3.5 Billion + in 2021, and expected annual revenue growth at 25%+ for the foreseeable future. If plans are executed properly and debt is managed Callaway is on track to exceed 7 Billion in Sales by 2025 as Topgolf continues to expand internationally as they currently only have 2% of the addressable market.\n\n**Price Target and Valuation**\n\nPrice Target raise to $40 from Jefferies [**https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3230379&headline=ELY-Callaway-Golf-price-target-raised-to--from--at-Jefferies**](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3230379&headline=ELY-Callaway-Golf-price-target-raised-to--from--at-Jefferies)\n\n**Price to Sales**\n\n2021 FY Revenue Forecast: $3.6B Topgolf 1.5B (30% CAGR) + Callaway 2.1B\n\n= 28.95/(3,600,000,000/163,000,000)\n\nELY P/S = 1.31\n\nGOLF P/S = 1.96\n\nELY P/S Fair Value = $43.31 (28.95\\*(1.96/1.31)\n\nThis P/S is compared to GOLF which has stagnant revenue growth at 3% YoY growth.\n\nELY should be valued at a much higher multiple thanks to its 30% CAGR which would label it as a \u201cgrowth company and should be valued as such\u201d. Growth companies have price to sales ratios ranging between 5-15. ELY price target in the $100-$300 range long term using these multiples. Short term it will climb to above $43 to be inline with its peers and will run to above $100 over the next year once Topgolf revenues are reflected.\n\n**Short Interest:**\n\nCallaway historically trades on low volume, averaging 1.6M shares traded daily in January. The current short interest is 19.34% of the float or roughly 16.77 million shares. With the recent climb from $24 to $29 over the past month 1.3 million share sold short covered and closed their position. As $ELY continues to climb and when earnings beats in February shorts will cover and send the price up faster thanks to its wide spreads and relatively low volume.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nCallaway purchased Topgolf at a fraction of the price it would of IPO\u2019ed for thanks to the pandemic. Topgolf acquisition is undervalued, bringing in CAGR at 30% year over year and will experience growth exceeding 50% in 2021 thanks to Callaway's aggressive venue expansion plans. There are multiple synergies that will benefit both companies as a result of this merger (used clubs, merchandise sales at Topgolf) Callaway will beat their upcoming earnings report thanks to the growth in new golfers during the year. Callaway will triple from these levels over the next couple years and is currently undervalued compared to its peers.\n\n**Position:**\n\n02/19/2021 30C\u2019s for earnings play will roll them into long term calls after ER.\n\n01/20/2023 40C Long Term play\n\nCalls are still fairly cheap, get them while you can.", "author_fullname": "t2_iqja2", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Callaway Golf $ELY Earnings Estimate, Long Term Target and Topgolf DD \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_l4ogq9", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 129, "total_awards_received": 2, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 129, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1611584107.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1611612271.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Callaway Analysis:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Topgolf Acquisition</strong></p>\n\n<p>Topgolf was acquired in an all share purchase value at 2 Billion in October 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Topgolf will issue 2 Billion worth of shares once the merger is approved in early 2021.</p>\n\n<p>(69 Million shares or a 73% increase in float based on current levels)</p>\n\n<p>Topgolf was in talks with multiple banks for an IPO in January 2020 valued at 4 Billion prior to the pandemic. <a href=\"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/callaways-topgolf-acquisition-is-a-risky-bet-amid-the-pandemic-191136062.html\">https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/callaways-topgolf-acquisition-is-a-risky-bet-amid-the-pandemic-191136062.html</a></p>\n\n<p>If top golf were to have been listed via IPO it could have easily fetched upwards of 6 Billion + with the recent IPO craze and explosion of growth in golf.</p>\n\n<p>Callaway Golf landed Topgolf at a steal of a price with this 2 Billion dollar acquisition and the current stock price is undervalued based on this alone.</p>\n\n<p>Callaway&#39;s market cap after merger will be 4.5 Billion assuming shares issued are based on today&#39;s price.
