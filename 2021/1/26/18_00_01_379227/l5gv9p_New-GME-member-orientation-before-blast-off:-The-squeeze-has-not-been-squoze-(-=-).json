With big dick energy seemingly out of no where Michael Burry *(yes that dude in the Big Short who seems like a fellow autist)* buys 2,750,000 shares or 3.05% of GameStock. In his actual [letter to the board](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190819005633/en/) *(yes I dug it up so you can read it as well)* he describes the thought process for the purchase bullets below.\n\n* GameStop was trading at an all-time low ($3.78/share) and he believed that it had not leveraged it's \"elite potision in the gaming universe\" over the last 5 years *(keep in mind, it's fucking GameStop a cultural icon large enough to make a grown man weep with fond memories*\n* Shareholders do not have faith in current managament and have not been inspired by new leadership policies\n* At time of writing stocks were more than 60% shorted\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*(Taking a break to say, it's not too late the* ***squeeze has not been squoze*** *oblig \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c = \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ryan mega dick Cohen writes a letter**\n\nThen in Nov 16th 2020, Ryan Cohen comes in swinging and tears a new one to the board members of GameStop. For people who don't know who Ryan Cohen is, he stuck the finger to Amazon and [built a digital e-commerce site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewy_(company)) (wiki link) for fucking dogs and cats into a $3.35 billion entity by 2017. Keep in mind that he submitted a Schedule 13D to purchase 121,644 shares at $6.56 per and 163,030 at $8.63 - that's a 10% stake [(yes, I've also dug the original Schedule 13d using google)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000699/rc13da2-091820.htm).

Although I don't yet have the current data on todays short position, I can say for certain the stock remains very heavily shorter, perhaps more so now than at any previous time. Today, I called my broker asking about the availability of shares to short and the borrow costs. We have one of the larger accounts at our brokers firm and I was able to speak directly to the \"hard to borrow\" desk. No borrowable shares are available at any broker, anywhere, at this time, even for high borrow costs or even from other brokers. This extreme short against a small common float, made more extreme no-doubt by naked shorting, could end very poorly for those short this issue. As they are forced to close out their positions, the stock will continue to rise and continue to exacerbate the positive effects the rising price has on the above 4 issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, this is not financial advice; do your own DD.
