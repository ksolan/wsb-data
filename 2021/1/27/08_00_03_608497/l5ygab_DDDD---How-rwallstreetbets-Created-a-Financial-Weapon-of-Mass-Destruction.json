{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Inspired by the recent events in r/wallstreetbets causing $GME, $BB, and $BBRY, among other historically highly shorted stocks to surge just to spite some rich people in wall street, I've decided to come out of retirement from r/wallstreetbets and publish a new edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD) covering the exact mechanics that made this possible. I\u2019ll also introduce those of you that are unfamiliar how r/wallstreetbet\u2019s favorite gambling device, stock options, actually work and how they can be used by this subreddit as a weapon of mass destruction against hedge funds like Melvin - all dumbed down to a fifth grade reading level so that the average person in this subreddit will mostly understand what I\u2019m talking about.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n### Shorting\n\n**How It Works**\n\nMost traditional (i.e. boomer) investors usually try to make money by going long - i.e. \u201cbuy low and sell high\u201d; this is when you buy a stock thinking it will go up in the future (bullish). Shorting is the opposite of this, you \u201csell high and buy low\u201d, thinking the stock will go down in the future (bearish). This is usually done through the broker, where the prospective short seller would \u201cborrow\u201d the shares from them, and they would need to pay back these shares in some future date by \u201ccovering their shorts\u201d - or buying back the exact same quantity of shares they owe the broker.\n\nFor example, imagine that there were only 10 Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards in the world. Because nobody wants to deal with taking physical possession of these cards and risk losing their Pokemon card in their laundry or something, everyone pays a Pokemon card dealer a small fee to store it for them. Through their dealer, you can buy and sell these Pokemon cards as well. A \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b realizes that maybe Pokemon cards are dumb and borrows 2 Surprised Pikachu cards (who has a prearranged agreement with some institutional Pokemon card hoarder to loan them out for interest) and sell them for $420 each, thinking that they're actually work $100 at most, and plans to buy the Pokemon cards back at that price to repay his Pokemon card loan (i.e. covering their shorts) - this is a short sale. Since no one actually wants to physically hold these Pokemon cards, these cards physically stay with the dealer who could then lend out these exact same Pokemon card if the buyer also has an agreement to allow them to do so. This means that you can actually have people owing more than the total number of Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards in existence (i.e. short interest > 100%).\n\nReplace \u201cSurprised Pikachu Pokemon card\u201d with stocks and \u201cPokemon card dealer\u201d with \u201cbroker\u201d and you have a short sale of shares. Interestingly enough, this also applies 80% to how banks work as well.\n\n**Short Squeezes**\n\nSo when does a short seller need to cover their shorts? Well, either when a) The short seller wants to, either to take profit or to stop a loss, b) Their broker forces them to through a margin call, or c) The broker forces them to as the broker has recalled their loan, usually for a hard to borrow stock - they get \u201cbought in\u201d. Today, we\u2019ll focus on C) because this is how short squeezes happen.\n\nSo, what does a broker recalling their loan mean? Well, to go back to the Pokemon card example, imagine that the dealer only has 6 Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards that he\u2019s legally allowed to loan out. Some more \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b short sells all the 6 remaining Pokemon cards until the dealer has no more available on hand. So what happens when someone wants to buy a Surprised Pikachu Pokemon Card and doesn\u2019t want the dealer to lend out their cards? He\u2019ll have to force one of those \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b to buy back the card that they owe them so the dealer can give it to the prospective buyer. But who can the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b buy back the card from? The dealer. But the dealer doesn\u2019t have any cards to sell, so they need to force another \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b to cover so that the former \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b can cover their shorts. This vicious cycle repeats and leads towards a sudden surge in demand for Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards and a spike in prices for it - a short squeeze.\n\n**The Institutional Factor**\n\nOne thing alluded above was that shares can only be borrowed from \\*some\\* share holders, but not all. So who exactly can and does a broker typically borrow these shares from? These are usually margin accounts of either institutional and sometimes (although much less frequently) retail investors. Usually, when an entity signs a margin agreement, which allows them to borrow either cash or shares from the broker, they give permission to the broker to also lend out their shares in the process, and thereby also give up their voting rights - in case you\u2019ve ever wondered who actually the share \\*actually\\* belonged to in shareholders meetings. Since almost every institution except Warren Buffet uses margin to a certain extent, and not that many retail investors do, especially given that retirement accounts are forbidden to use margin, and it\u2019s much easier to \u201cfind\u201d one big source of TSLA shares from one big institution with a margin account rather than find thousands of smaller margin retail accounts who hold TSLA shares, so most of the time, these shares are being borrowed from an institution (i.e. pension fund, hedge fund). This means that shares that are almost disproportionately held by retail investors are much harder to short because they\u2019re harder to borrow from the broker, and retail-heavy stocks like HTZ, GME, NIO, and NKLA, which virtually no institutions actually hold, will demand high interest rates when shorting and the sellers can much more easily be forced to cover during a short squeeze.\n\n### Stock Options\n\n**What are Stock Options**\n\nA stock option is a contract between the writer and whoever holds it that gives the option holder the right to buy (call option) or sell (put option) 100 shares of the underlying stock on or before the expiry date at a specified strike price. So for example, buying a GME 1/29 $1000c gives whoever the holder of this contract is the option to buy from the writer of this contract 100 shares of GME at $1000 / share on or before 1/29. Obviously if GME is lower than $1000 before that date, the holder would be an idiot to exercise this option to buy GME shares for more than their current market value, so they expire worthless.\n\nThis effectively provides the option holder an immense amount of leverage, and provides the opportunity for them to 10x or even 100x their original investment if the underlying asset moves the right way - for example because a subreddit declares war on a hedge fund and pumps up a stock to make them go bankrupt, while limiting their losses to the cost of the option. The option writer will in return receive a premium for the option, potentially risking an infinite amount of money, but with a high likelihood of making a small profit. These writers would either be\n\n1. Theta gang - who are looking to generate a tidy income source from those option premiums and pray that the stock doesn\u2019t move in the wrong direction too much\n2. A market maker - who writes the contract when they see an arbitrage opportunity between the market value of an option and the theoretical value of it, and hedging their contract they wrote by buying / shorting the underlying assets so they effectively don\u2019t actually take a position in the market.\n\nWe\u2019ll go over how 2) works and how this mechanism can be used as a financial nuclear bomb, but first you need to learn some greek. \n\n**The Greeks**\n\nThe greeks in finance is a set of factors that can affect the price of a stock option / group of options\n\nDelta - Change of the option price as the stock price changes\n\nGamma - Change in Delta as the stock price changes\n\nVega - Change in the option price as volatility of the stock changes\n\nTheta - The decay in the option price as the expiration date gets nearer\n\nRho - Change of the option price as the interest rate changes; Most people ignore this\n\nLooking at the greeks of the gambling tickets you buy is very useful to analyzing the ways you can make or lose money on them. Think TSLA will go up a modest amount? Buy a high-Delta call. Think GME is going to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 1000% more? Look for a high Gamma call so your Delta gains accelerate as GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15. Do you feel like a vampire and want to have a steady income source from degenerate r/wallstreetbet gamblers on a stock you think will go flat (relative to historical volatility) over the next few months? Join theta gang and sell a high-Theta and high-Vega option!\n\n**Market Makers**\n\nThe Black-Scholes model is a fancy mathematical model that describes a \u201cperfect price\u201d (a lot of caveats here) for a stock option. This is done by showing how every option written can theoretically be perfectly hedged by a series of purchases or short sells on the underlying stock. This means that theoretically, if there is a large gap between the theoretical price from Black Scholes and the actual price for an option, there is an \u201carbitrage\u201d opportunity - this is where market makers come in.\n\nMarket makers are companies that provide liquidity to a market by offering to be counterparty to trades. This is especially useful in stock options, where a single ticker can have thousands of options, and there might be someone who wants to buy a GME 1/29 $1000c but no one is actually actively selling it. However, this option might be listed anyways and Citadel will sell you the call if anyone tries to buy it and then immediately hedge it. In fact, when you buy an option chances are you\u2019re not actually buying it from its previous owner selling an option they already own, but from a market maker like Citadel (who is responsible for over 99% of all options volume in 3000 stocks).\n\nSo what happens when someone buys an option from a market maker? Since the market maker typically can\u2019t (and probably don\u2019t want to) take a position, meaning taking a directional bet if a stock goes up or down, they\u2019ll immediately hedge the option they just conjured out of thin air by buying or shorting the equivalent number of shares such that the Delta of those shares is the same as the Delta of the option they wrote to remain Delta-neutral, so if the stock goes up or down their position value doesn\u2019t change - this is called **Delta hedging**. Furthermore, as the stock price moves up (calls) or down (puts), they\u2019ll need to buy or sell even more of those shares to remain Delta neutral since the Delta will change due to the option\u2019s Gamma - this is called **Gamma hedging**.\n\n### Putting It All Together - How options can be used as weapons of mass destruction against short sellers\n\nNow we have the tools to understand how these two financial concepts put together can make billion-dollar hedge funds go bankrupt. Through Delta and Gamma hedging of market makers, buyers can have the effect of buying shares dozens of times the value they actually spent buying their option; a XYZ 4/20 690c can cost only $100 in premiums but causes the market maker to buy $2000 in the underlying stock to hedge against it. If you get enough retail investors to do this, they'll have the impact of billion-dollar whales on the market despite their small stimulus-check-funded portfolios.\n\nNow, you do this on a stock that is heavily shorted, and with very little institutions actually holding real shares of these - making it harder for brokers to find shares to borrow, and you have yourself a weapon of mass financial destruction capable of making billions of Melvin\u2019s money disappear in a single day and potentially have GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 to a trillion dollar market cap.\n\n**How** r/wallstreetbets **Controls the Stock Market**\n\nThe one thing that\u2019s interesting about all of this is r/wallstreebet\u2019s unique position in being able to facilitate this weapon of mass financial destruction because\n\n1. Most rich people or institutions too risk adverse to buy large amounts of out of the money options (unless you're Chamath or Elon)\n2. This can only really happen on stocks that very few institutions (i.e. rich people) actually own, meaning it needs to be held / bought on mass by retail investors\n3. In any other scenario where 1 and 2 happen to be true, this would be classified as market manipulation and be immediately shut down by the SEC\n\n**My Positions**\n\nr/wallstreetbets veterans may recognize me as the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b who wrote those long-ass 2000 word essays about how the [stock market is in a bubble](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) and loaded up on VIX calls last time you heard from me. Although I still stand by my thesis and stocks like GME, TSLA, and NKLA is just proof that we've reached the euphoria phase of it, I learned my lesson that I'm idiot trying to short it (for exactly the reasons described above) and got the fuck out of my position when VIX shot up back in Sept.

Now that I&#39;m busy with work again, I probably won&#39;t be posting as frequently as I have had in the past, but you&#39;ll see me around from time to time :).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "coin_price": 30, "id": "award_b4ff447e-05a5-42dc-9002-63568807cfe6", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "PREMIUM", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Illuminati_512.png", "days_of_premium": 0, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Illuminati_512.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Illuminati_512.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Illuminati_512.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Illuminati_512.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Illuminati_512.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "A glowing commendation for all to see", "end_date": null, "subreddit_coin_reward": 0, "count": 1, "static_icon_height": 2048, "name": "All-Seeing Upvote", "resized_static_icons": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it?width=16&height=16&auto=webp&s=d88c9a453f8ac38850b7a8241cfe5804b7b4905d", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it?width=32&height=32&auto=webp&s=96a25019eb75878bdec4f6c012540f3baffbb1b2", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it?width=48&height=48&auto=webp&s=1a51d27d75afde3fbde8bba84f9338f511211461", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it?width=64&height=64&auto=webp&s=96af5ec460b05669ed60224cb0619bb8884abe27", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it?width=128&height=128&auto=webp&s=2d3e648ed2302e6258673051ca5291f57beb29d4", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_format": "APNG", "icon_height": 2048, "penny_price": null, "award_type": "global", "static_icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Illuminati_512.png"}, {"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "coin_price": 250, "id": "award_a67d649d-5aa5-407e-a98b-32fd9e3a9696", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "APPRECIATION", "coin_reward": 100, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/bph2png4ajz31_TodayILearned.png", "days_of_premium": 0, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/bph2png4ajz31_TodayILearned.png?width=16&height=16&auto=webp&s=bbfa251092cce139b37d74237ec28a8c4e8f06b0", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/bph2png4ajz31_TodayILearned.png?width=32&height=32&auto=webp&s=e1f9dd28741e2551b1fbbd341b006cc316f48fa1", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/bph2png4ajz31_TodayILearned.png?width=48&height=48&auto=webp&s=d93434d26563a534397ff748cce71d4b733c32d9", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/bph2png4ajz31_TodayILearned.png?width=64&height=64&auto=webp&s=cf4a1ddb8474d11682f0d88aa32562f9fcbf30b0", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/bph2png4ajz31_TodayILearned.png?width=128&height=128&auto=webp&s=70b1596cdd0ae75b52db5c2732d8c336d300cc11", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "The more you know...
