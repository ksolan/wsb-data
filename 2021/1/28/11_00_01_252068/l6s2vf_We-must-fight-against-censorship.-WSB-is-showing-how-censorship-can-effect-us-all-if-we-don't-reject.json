{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "There is a desperate and coordinated effort to thwart everything retail investors are doing, censor and ban their communication platforms, and lobby for regulations to protect the elite Wall Street investors against the retail investors.  \n\nCNBC has been relentlessly spreading the narrative that the government needs to step in to 'protect' the retail investors from themselves.  As short-selling hedge funds are bleeding billions of dollars, CNBC has the gaul to suggest that it is the retail investors that need to be protected.  \n\nThese ultra-wealthy investors have more influence than you could ever imagine, and they are transparently using it to their advantage.  Not only are they using the media to spread fear about these squeezed stocks to drive the price down and push the narrative that the government needs to regulate retail investors, they are also using their power to CENSOR these communities and keep them from exercising their free speech.  \n\nTech companies, likely influenced by their politician buddies in Washington, have been overtly censoring millions of people from their platforms simply for having political beliefs that they do not support.  Youtube has been banning channels for minor grievances.  Twitter has been silencing thousands of vocal users.  Facebook has been doing the same.  And most recently, the tech companies used their collective monopolistic power to basically destroy Twitters largest potential competitor: Parler.  It was no coincidence that nearly every tech platform and web service decided within a few hours to ban services to Parler.  They all used the same justification, even though their own platforms were equally as guilty, if not moreso, of the same wrongdoings.  It was blatantly coordinated censorship.  And they don't care, because they have the power.  \n\nDroves of people defended these actions as acceptable because these are not government entities, and they can censor anyone they want.  Many smugly pointed out that this censorship is not a violation of the First Amendment.  And they are legally correct (barring any future antitrust legislation), but they are absolutely morally wrong to defend this censorship.  \n\nFree speech is not just a right enshrined by our constitution, it is a cultural ethos and value that has been embraced by all political sides of this country since this country was founded.  Censoring legal speech has been looked down upon and shunned by nearly everyone in this country for 100's of years.  But recently, it seems that this ethos has been set aside as long as it is only those you disagree with who are being censored.  \n\nAnd then we have WSB and GME.  \n\nThe people of WSB rarely if ever talk politics.  We are a massive group of investors who get together to discuss their dumb investment strategies.  People from every background come together and discuss one thing: investing and tendies.  There is no left or right, no red or blue.....only green.  \n\nBut now that they are hitting the elites where it hurts, the wallet, the elite are using their power to censor.  \n\nFirst, we have Discord.  Over 250,000 people on the WSB discord.  [And it was censored for 'hate speech'.](https://gizmodo.com/discord-bans-r-wallstreetbets-for-hate-speech-violation-1846146314)  The most obvious color to paint a group that you want to silence: call them hateful, racist, etc.  \n\nNote that Discord has had significant investment from private equity funds including FirstMark Capital, Greenoaks Capital Partners, Index Ventures, IVP, Greylock Partners, Benchmark, Accel, General Catalyst, Ridge Ventures, Spark Capital, and Tencent Holdings. \n\nWho do you think pulled the strings on Discord for them to censor the WSB channel?  \n\nAnd now you have Reddit.  Commentators on CNBC have already called for the WSB subreddit to be banned.  And with Reddit's investor profile, who knows what billionaire may call in an order to censor that subreddit.  \n\nSo you see, this isn't just about tech companies censoring those for political beliefs.  This is about censoring anyone who threatens your wealth or power.  Many of those who defended the previous censorships may have said, 'yes, I'm okay with it because I don't like their politics'.  But many of those same people may now see that accepting censorship as a norm may one day come back and hurt them.  We must collectively reject and fight back against censorship, lest it comes to effect us all.  \n\nI truly hope the last few days serve as a wake up call for those defending the billionaires and big tech censorship.  We need to get back to 'we the people' controlling this country and not 'we the elite'.  I know the censorship issue may seem like a drop in the bucket to some, but when it comes to our culture and values, that slope can be slippery my friend.  \n\nTl;dr - GME to the moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, Censorship by the powerful is bad.", "author_fullname": "t2_4z691", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "We must fight against censorship.
