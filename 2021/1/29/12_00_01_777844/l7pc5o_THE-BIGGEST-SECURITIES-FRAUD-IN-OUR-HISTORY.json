He could not post this on his own because of karma/account age restrictions. All credit goes to him, I'm just the smooth-brained voice-box. Mods lemme know if this is against the rules, and I'll delete it. Anyway, here's what he shared:\n\n**TL;DR**: Hedge funds *most probably* gamed stock prices for other trending tickers in order to use profits from expiring OTM calls to offset losses on $GME\n\n\nI\u2019m starting to connect the dots between OTM Call contracts, Thursday\u2019s RH Shenanigans, and GME. In this post I\u2019m going to explain how I believe they are all interconnected, and how RH and Citadel have committed Securities Fraud that will once again force average Americans to foot the bill of Wall Street\u2019s bad bets. But only if they get away with it. \n\n\nFor starters, we need to go back to Monday, Jan 25th. \n\n\nRobinhood \u201csells\u201d us these deep OTM options at the start of the week. We buy them up like crazy in stocks like NOK, BB, AMC, etc. All trends until Wednesday indicate that many of these once deep OTM calls will be ITM come Friday, which would result in catastrophic losses for the MM.\n\n\nWho is RH\u2019s MM and very likely the main issuer of all of these call options? Citadel LLC. \n\n\nNow what would Citadel have to gain from issuing such an insane volume of Call options? Let\u2019s find out. \n\n\nWe have seen attempt after attempt after attempt for Citadel or Melvin Capital Management to manipulate GME and other stocks over the last few days in AH trading, and during the ladder selling to decrease the price of GME while many retail investors were locked out of buying more stock and attempted triggering of limit sell orders utilizing RH data. \n\n\nWhat we saw Thursday was their nuclear option, last case scenario, \u201coh fuck\u201d moment. \n\n\nWhen it was apparent that their cheaper attempts to manipulate the market was not working, what did they do? Publicly and openly restrict the buying (but not selling) of WSB stocks... and it\u2019s worse than everybody thinks, and I\u2019ll get to that in a minute. \n\n\nBy restricting buying, but allowing selling,  RH and Capital were able to reduce demand in the market an astounding amount, causing stock prices in all of these WSB stocks to fall, this then caused a domino effect as paper hands folded their hands and caused a domino effect on all of our WSB stocks. \n\n\nWhat\u2019s the net impact of this?\n\n\nWhile GME hands were able to hold, (which is amazing but we will need to circle back to) They dropped the stocks to critical levels in BB, NOK, AMC that will earn Citadel **billions** as INSANE VOLUMES OF Call contracts expire OTM Friday 1/29. They will then turn around and use these billions to close out their position in GME. To show how much the MMs stand to gain here, I have linked the attached image to show the ridiculous amount of money that they will gain if their plan goes through [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/fw46dcR)\n\n\nThey manipulated us into taking a bet that they had already planned to fix. They knew if these bets miss we are left with nothing and they gain all the upside. They have committed countless acts of securities fraud through the past week that ultimately have robbed retail investors, forcing them to pay the bill for Short-Sellers\u2019 catastrophic bets.\n\n\nIn essence, our only hope at forcing a GME squeeze actually goes against what we have been thinking this entire time. Before, it meant on this subreddit was that we need to focus entirely on GME. I fear now RH and Citadel have forced us into a position where our only way to ensure a GME squeeze is to ensure that they are unable to profit off these Call contracts in the other stocks that so many of us are exposed to. \n\n\nWe have created a war, and I feel the only way we can win is by getting BB$30 EOW, NOK $7 EOW, etc. HAVING SAID THAT, GME still needs to be absolutely HAMMERED tomorrow. DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS BOYS. That is the only way we will win this war.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer 2**: This is not investment advice. WE JUST LIKE THE STOCKS.\n\n\n\n**Edit1**: I APOLOGIZE FOR THE BLASPHEMOUS OVERSIGHT.
