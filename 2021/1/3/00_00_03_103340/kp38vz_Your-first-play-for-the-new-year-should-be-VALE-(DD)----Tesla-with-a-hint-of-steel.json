Well, Indonesia's President wants to take advantage of large Nickel deposits by striking a deal with Tesla since EV battery technology requires the metal. [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-president-tesla-exclusive-idCAKBN27T13Q](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-president-tesla-exclusive-idCAKBN27T13Q)\n\nLG Chem is one of Tesla's key battery makers.

The key here is the environmental impact. As you might know, Elon started Tesla as a crusade through which he aims to make the world a better place. He has made all his patents public for the single purpose that the development of EVs is sped up for the greater good of the human race. As much as everyone likes to think that billionaires are spineless assholes, Elon truly does care about the environment and the future of our planet -- no wonder he also wants to start a mars colony, because he recognizes the issues our world faces.\n\nElon tweeted a while back about how he wants to mine nickel responsibly [https://twitter.com/business/status/1297164794617831425?lang=en](https://twitter.com/business/status/1297164794617831425?lang=en).\n\nOut of the 3 companies with major mining operations in Indonesia, Vale is the most suitable to mine nickel in an environmentally friendly manner.

This is most definitely an attempt to clean things up to attract Elon's investment. Not to mention that Tesla was already being supplied nickel from this New Caledonia mine, so it's as if Elon enjoyed the trial version and now wants to swing big.\n\nLet's recap. The ball is rolling for Tesla to partake in Nickel operations within Indonesia.
