Bulls believe the pent-up park demand, a sea of new contents coming to Disney +, and potentialy hyper growth in streaming revenue. It is strikingly similar to the debates around TSLA for years (and in fact many growth stocks). And bears lost huge because investors love growth at end of the day.\n\nThis year there will be >10 Disney movies on Disney + premiere access in 2021, vs just Mulan in 2020, plus many other TV series and movies only on Disney +. Given DIS's superior brands, top cultural influence, and unrivalled quality, if streaming growth is able to break into 200M-300M subscribers in 1-2 years, there will be huge profit and cash & DIS will break 1T at that point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoing forward, every ER they update the subscription number, it may boost the stock price. **The stock currently has many short-term catalysts for the next ER:**\n\n1. At 35% capacity, Disney FL Parks are extremely full. It regularly hits capacity since November, is all sold out for New Year Eve. And China Park has been open and on fire for the whole quarter. This is a strong signal for park's pent up demand, and bodes well for DIS revenue in Q4.\n2. Soul turns out to be an unexpected success, and is globally acclaimed. Not really a kids movie, but widely praised and may become an Oscar winner. Box-office wise, it has grossed over USD 20M in China in a week, gaining more and more popularity despite zero ads in China  (10M in past two days alone), and is expected to gross 60M-100M in China at least.\n3. With Mando last two episodes, Soul, and Mulan all appearing on Disney + for free during December (especially they are on Disney + after 12.2, the cut-off date for the 86.8M subscriber disclosed on DIS investor day), **I estimae that Disney + shall have a subscriber count of 90M--100M as of end of 2020**. Any number within the range is bullish --- if they can hit close to 95M--100M, it will be perceived as a monumental success (imagine >10M subscriber for one month only!), showing investors the big power of Disney brand, and may immediately rocket the stock to 250.\n4. With increased park revenue and Disney + growth in this Q, DIS has a good chance to beat Q4 estimates for revenue and profit (based on Yahoo finance). And they have beat twice in past two Q.\n\nIt does not mean the stock has no risk, if the streaming growth slows down in a material way, or Macro uncertainty rises again, then stock will certainty react negatively.\n\nStrategy-wise, do stocks or leaps --- stocks will double, and leaps have a chance to triple or more at current streaming growth.
