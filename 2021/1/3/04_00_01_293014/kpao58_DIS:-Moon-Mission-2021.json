With Mando last two episodes, Soul, and Mulan all appearing on Disney + for free during December (especially they are on Disney + after 12.2, the cut-off date for the 86.8M subscriber disclosed on DIS investor day), **I estimae that Disney + shall have a subscriber count of 90M--100M as of end of 2020**.
