They are widely used by big name customers including Google, Microsoft, Boeing, Walmart, Coca Cola, UPS, AMD, NVIDIA, Abbott, and dozens of others.\n\nWhat differentiates them from other (more boring) supply chain management companies is the way they use AI to predict changes in supply and demand. Basically, E2open allows companies to see 10 steps ahead into the future to forecast how much inventory they will need based on hundreds of variables (geopolitics, resource availability, etc). This saves companies hundreds of millions in waste. CEO Michael Farlekas  compares it to working at a lemonade stand and being able to know ahead of time exactly how many lemons you will need. Obviously this will save you from wasting money on lemons that would spoil. E2open is the only company that integrates this type of AI technology with a vast data Cloud network.\n\nE2open uses a subscription model to make consistent sustainable revenue from their 1000+ customers. There are multiple services they offfer, but over 50% of their customers only use 1 service. What's nice is that existing customers go on to utilize more and more of their services as they realize the value it adds to their companies. Google for example paid E2open twice as much over the course of 2 years. E2open makes additional revenue from new customers, and also by strategic value-adding acquisitions. The SPAC deal is allowing E2open to clean up their balance sheet so they can add value to their software portfolio (and charge higher premiums to existing customers) and continue making acquisitions.\n\nE2open has been growing at a rapid clip since they were taken private in 2015. In 2015 they made $80M in revenue and in 2020 they made $335M. That's 420% growth in 5 years, or roughly +84% growth per year.\n\nIn the last 5 years they increased their revenue +420% by value-adding acquisitions they've made over the last decade --- Icon (2013), Serus Corp (2014), Terra Technology (2016), Orchestro (2016), Steelwedge (2017), Zyme (2017), Entomo and Birch Worldwide (2018), Inttra (2018), and Amber Road (2018) --- and integrating these different services to create a beautiful comprehensive end-to-end platform.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, their projections for 2021 are much lower at only +10% estimated revenue growth, which is the main reason most would argue P-C-P-L is trading so close to the NAV. However, 10% growth is actually really solid when you look at their margins and consider that 80% of their revenue is recurring with excellent customer retention. Institutional investors especially will appreciate E2open as the reliable revenue generating machine that it has  become. \n\nI'm also still optimistic about valuing E2open as a growth stock and feel the 10% is a low-ball estimate based on comparisons to the median growth of other supply chain management companies. I'm suspecting E2open will consistently  outperform expectations on a quarterly as the SPAC capital equips them to capitalize on their services, continue making acquisitions, and ultimately tap into millions in white space opportunity.\n\nEven if E2open maintained a 10% growth rate  and if this were factored into its valuation, $11/share is still too damn low. E2open compares itself to Descartes, Kinaxis, Manhattan, and Spscommerce. With a median of 10.7x revenue, E2 was only at 7x, and with a median of 34.7x, E2 was only at 21.3x, meaning E2open has a much higher upside than its peers.\n\nInstitutions will bring the stock price up to par with it's peers and I believe the low ball projected growth is a conservative number that they will completely destroy when you consider their growth of +400% over the last 5 years. While 10% is perfectly fine for a company like E2open, I'm expecting the trend of the last 5 years to continue in 2021 and we'll be seeing some exciting numbers. \n\nMy PT pre-merge is 15 and 25 EOY assuming their projected 10% revenue growth. If E2open surpasses 2021 expected revenue as I'm suspecting and they have major quarterly beats, I'm holding until 50.\n\nDisclaimer: This is my largest position.
