{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Hi All, \n\nI debated if I should make this post but I thought it might help one or two new kids who are new to investing. If you think it's useless down vote it and I will delete it. \n\nAt the beginning of 2020 I  was just like most of you was not a member of WSBs and invested on my own accord. All that changed in February. I opened an active trading account for fun. I joined reddit and figured I should get involved with the community so that we make money together. Here are the lessons that I think would help some of newer guys than me. Also here is my performance in my speculative account which was opened in March 2020:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w762xt6805961.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=f227bc450c381543cb098dd12cfeb3f1f1a1aebd\n\n**Lesson 1: Consistency Matters**\n\nMy goal with this speculative account was to try different strategies but get consistent returns nonetheless. I aimed to not have any down months. This helps alleviate the mental anguish caused by roller-coaster-type portfolios. As my mama told me 5 years ago, you are playing with hard-earned-money. This is why I stayed away from YOLOing the whole account on few select plays. I aimed to have many different bets going on at the same time. \n\n**Lesson 2: Helping others is harder than earning money.**\n\nMy dad opened a speculation account at the same in March. I decided that I would help him have a similar performance as mine. I kept on feeding him info about my trades. What did he do? Most of the times he thought I was retarded and called the local hospital for me. When Boeing dropped to $93, I was on the phone telling him this is free money. I told him to by $30k but he just bought $10k. I was buying American Airlines on the same day. This story repeated many times over the last 9 month. I think at the end he managed to scratch of \\~250%. Now I have him on a conservative buy and hold strategy since he is not cut out to actively trade. And by actively I mean 4 trades a week for him. \n\n**Lesson 3: Having a good broker is important**\n\nIf you haven't deleted Robinhood and gotten your self a proper broker after you hearing or experiencing bugs, crashes, service outages, your data being sold, .... then I don't know if I can convince you. Other brokers will give you access to ADRs and allow you invest in some bigger European companies that are trading OTC here. \n\n**Lesson 4: Don't argue with people; instead discuss ideas.**\n\nIf you notice someone is arguing instead of discussing ideas with you then just ignore them. For every seller of a stock there is a buyer. There is no point in personally attacking people. If you believe strongly that they are wrong, then just inverse their trade. Respect and thank them for sharing their trades with you, even if you disagree with them.\n\n**Lesson 5: Media is a hype machine**\n\nCNBC, Bloomberg, ... are all in the business of creating excitement and increasing their viewership. They are not there to enhance your returns. What gets people's attention is usually not a good investment. \n\n**Lesson 6: Reddit slaps you harder than a twisted tea**\n\nI used to share ALL my DDs here. Sharing is caring, right? apparently not. There was no shortage of personal attacks, being banned, DDs being deleted, ... My Karma even dropped to -1k in March. I am permanently banned from r/ investing, economics, .... I got temporary banned here, and two other investing subs. So I post less DDs now, and don't try to stop people from jumping from rooftops. \n\n**Lesson 7: Most popular posts/users should not be blindly mimicked**\n\nMost people including me already know this, but I keep seeing it here. I figured I should mention it since I have your attention. When you see a trade that is getting a lot of attention ask yourself: does this fit my strategy? If not then don't do it. What is strategy you ask? oh boy\n\n**Lesson 8: Don't let survivor bias fool you**\n\nEveryday people on WSB are throwing millions of dollars on thousands of small bets. The odds are some of them are gonna pay of. So when you see some guy posting Gain-porn of 1k turning to 100k overnight. Remember that over night thousands of other people with similar bets lost it all. So don't just follow people blindly. Some of the most respected guys here are essentially doing the same thing by YOLOing all their money on one bet that unfolds over several month. These guys last longer but essentially are playing few bets game. When you roll the dice 5 times the odds of you getting 5 in a row is a lot. There is a reason we don't hear from YungBillionaire anymore. Please don't Yolo your whole account on GME, Palantir, and such. \n\n**Lesson 9: Moderation on reddit is skewing the information you see**\n\nIt's hard to be an unpaid moderator on reddit. So more power to them. I have to say u/zjz is one of the best I've seen.... When a post has to clear the personal point of view of 10 moderators on each sub, you end up with what in the industry is known as committee results; ie neutered and already priced in. Usually 1/3 of my posts make it through the mod filter so I am posting less and less every day. Sometimes I discuss a post with a mod and make it acceptable to him and then another one comes and bans me for 3 days for a DD with 90% upvote. lol\n\n**Lesson 10: When the tide goes out you realize who was swimming naked.**  \n\nPopularized by WB, he wasn't the one who came up with it. When a correction happens, and I guarantee you there will be a correction, then you realize who was blindly chasing alpha without any risk management. The correction may not come for a few years but there always is a correction, pullback for some random reason. So **manage your risk.** Guh\n\n**Lesson 11: unless you have insider info do not buy weekly or even monthly options.**\n\nLEAPs are risky as well but can be managed. Most people here should not take the weekly or monthly option risk. You need years of experience before doing so. \n\n**Lesson 12: Paper accounts don't count.**\n\nYou need real money to be at risk so that you care and go through the emotions. I never had a paper account and if you are using one, in my opinion you are wasting your time. \n\n**Lesson 13: No one has a magic sauce.** \n\nThose who pretend to do are delusional. There is no such thing as \"always do this and you will win\". Market changes and strategies that work now will not work in 2 month. If a guru says buy x, y and z and you will make money, that's total BS.  \n\n**Lesson 14: If you get money help yourself and your family**\n\nYou have the option Yoloing your money on weeklys, buy coke, or elevating your life. Money truly brings happiness. Only people who don't have it think that it does not; and site a bs study. Use your money to help your family at key points in their lives. Help with their Mortgage down payment, buy a car for the ones who really need them,... Use your money to work less and work out more. Yolo in real life, not on options. \n\n**Lesson 15: If you don't invest with conviction, you won't get the results that matter**\n\nYou have to know why you are buying some stock and why you would sell it. A lot of winning trades will go against you before they go green. To hold those positions when deep in the red, you gotta have conviction in your thesis. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not going to edit this post because it will mess up it's format. I am going to put a comment below with updates/corrections. Also do NOT message me personally.
