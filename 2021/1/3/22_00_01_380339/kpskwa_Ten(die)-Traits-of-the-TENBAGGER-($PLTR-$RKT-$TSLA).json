{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Fellow smooth brains, broke boiz, and gainz girls,\n\nI've had a lot of down time this week since I'm couped up in q-tine with the vid. Figured I'd change it up and spend time to listen and read about people who actually made money in the markets, instead of edging to EOY loss porn for 10 days straight. \n\nI found a few different hedge fund daddies to keep me company during the alt reality of rona isolation. These dudes weren't smooth brain; they read books and wrote them too. They made all their tendies in the pre-dawn era before the internet, but a lot of their concepts are the foundations of today's DD flair.\n\nOne of these hedge fund daddies is Peter Lynch; the silver fox averaged 30% returns over 13 years as manager of Fidelity's Magellan Fund. He frequently & routinely states \"Stonks only go up\" and \"Buy the FKN DIP\" in pre-internet era interviews and he's got a rager for the market advantages of individuals (retail, us, idiots) vs. wall street (chads, citron, warren buffet). He actually walked away from Wall Street at relatively young age to spend more time with his family. This decision can only be interpreted one way; he made enough tendies to send his wife's boyfriend back to instructing $PTON classes and preying on other men's wives. For this, the legacy of he Silver Fox must be immortalized - he is legend. \n\nAnyway, Lynch is pretty famous for coining the characteristics (traits) of a ten bagger. Since I've got lots of time and there's no loss porn on the weekends, I thought it would be an interesting idea to back test some of these ideas on WSB favorites & active bag holders like $RKT, $PLTR, and $TSLA. \n\n**10 Traits of a Ten Bagger:**\n\n**- (1. Name is Dull or Ridiculous: All tickers check.**\n\n* Red $RKT? Sheesh dude calm down.\n* $PLTR? Fool of a took! \n* $TSLA? That socialist electrician? \n\n**- (2. It does something dull: All tickers check.** \n\n* $RKT: Mortgage loan processing.\n* $PLTR: Data aggregation & integration. wut? \n* $TSLA: Sells cars.\n\n**- (3. It Does something disagreeable: All tickers check.**\n\n* $RKT: Online loan processing is perceived as untrustworthy by institutions & individuals.\n* $PLTR: Blah blah blah oppression, NSA & data privacy\n* $TSLA: \"There will never be a market for EVs!\"\n\n**- (4. Institutions don't own & analysts don't follow: Only $PLTR checks.**\n\n* $RKT: 15 analysts have coverage with an avg. PT of $24.7\n* $PLTR: 7 analysts have coverage with an avg. PT of $15\n* $TSLA: Everyone talkin' TSLA these days. Irrelevant. \n\n**- (5. It's depressing: All 3 tickers check with some massaging of the interpretation.**\n\n* $RKT: When I grew up, home loan refinancing was a bad thing borne from necessity. Exchanging equity for better loan terms prolongs payments and adds long-term interest. These improve affordability and increase in popularity with each recession.\n* $PLTR: Literally sells system solutions for crisis situations. Think COVID/Conflict/Fraud. \n* $TSLA: The narrative sells because the climate crisis is the defining issue of our age.\n\n**- (6. The industry isn't growing: All 3 check with some massaging of the interpretation.**\n\n* $RKT: Growth is not the same as appreciation. The housing market continues to spike in part because of archaic housing & city planning policies that prevent new supply from entering markets. \n* $PLTR: New data points & software solutions continue to be introduced & sold, but PLTR is unique in it's integration & aggregation capabilities. Nobody else is selling this particular solution; in fact, PLTR views their biggest competition as a companies' desire to internalize this solution. \n* $TSLA: EVs sales are in fact growing exponentially, however the sales are pulling demand from the existing market share of the automobile industry, not creating new market share. Additionally, modern transportation policy ***may*** reduce the amount of new cars on the road as EVs are increasingly exposed as an edge case for addressing climate change. Also, ARK (momma Wood) has done a bunch of research re: the pending used-car bubble that will put further ownership equity pressure on loans, dealers, and individuals still buying used ICE cars. The combined pressures of costs associated with personal vehicle ownership, rapid asset depreciation, autonomous ride hailing, modern transpo plans focused on decreased congestion & emissions, will significantly reduce the size of this industry in the near/mid term future.  \n   * P.S.  I <3 Pete Bootycheeks, US Transpo Sec. Build some rails & bike lanes.\n\n**- (7. It's got a NICHE: All 3 check.**\n\n* $RKT: mobile loan processing. Speed speed speed. Ease ease ease. Cheese cheese cheese. $RKT's solutions saves time, better prepare buyers & financers, simplifies the process, and reduces monthly expense. Rock solid like my $RKT in the mornings.\n* $PLTR: how many of you work at a fortune 500 (not wendys or $MCD) that requires you to query data for routine reports? How many logins do you have? how many systems do you need to navigate? Do you know how your co addresses this? They pay MBAs manager salaries, to people who can't write =sumif() excel functions, to piece together PPTs and workflow diagrams to communicate system enhancements to $100k+ soft devs and system architects that frankenstein together 10+ paid SAAS \"solutions\" in 1-3 years. $PLTR comes in hot and ready like the domineos pizza pie delivery guy ready to feed & seed. The agility of $PLTR is highly underappreciated.\n* $TSLA: Battery & self driving tech are the biggest niches at this point, but don't sleep on those EV credits. Wall street industry idiots are salty that $TSLA can improve margins by selling polluter permission slips to allow polluters to pollute, but co's love to pollute so those things print.  \n\n**-(8. Recurring Revenues: All 3 check.**\n\n* $RKT: Definition of \"Recurring\":  \"occurring again periodically or repeatedly.\" $RKT reports a lot of money each quarter's earnings reports. Don't @ me.\n* $PLTR: the business model is designed to scale billing in tandem with gains made from solution utility. \n* $TSLA: At this stage, car sales are growing and we haven't hit an extended downturn in the cyclical environment.  Just wait till the FSD, energy credits, insurance, ride hailing, and grid energy revenues print infinitely and indefinitely. Anticipate unrealized earnings & receivables to pace with earnings growth. \n\n**-(9. Insiders are buying: $RKT & $TSLA check.**\n\n* $RKT: Daddy Dan Gilbert & Juicy Jay Farner were loading up on shares < $20 in August \n* $PLTR: Mithril (a Papa Thiel fund) got clearance to buy an s-ton of $PLTR at some point last week. Basically a buy back, but we'll see more when the lock-up period ends.\n* $TSLA: Denholym sold 43k shares at \\~$400 per, but Emperor Elon is diamond handing his market cap option tranches which counts IMO.\n\n**-(10.
