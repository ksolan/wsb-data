The rule limits the percentage of an investment in equity securities that can be borrowed with a margin loan. A wake-up call is scheduled...\n\nIt was widely reported this week that total margin debt reached a new high of $722B. The WSJ\u2019s 12/28 lead Business and Finance story profiled a $TSLA retail investor, a civil engineer, who had parlayed a $23k option investment in $TSLA into a $2m position. Oh boy. The gentleman is to surely and genuinely be commended for the investment. An 87x gain in a short period is extraordinary (I've never done that, nor will I). That said, a quick perusal of $TSLA twitter commentary and recommendations is terrifying.\n\nOne can read the Journal article, [Investors Double Down on Stocks, Pushing Margin Debt to Record TSLA](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-double-down-on-stocks-pushing-margin-debt-to-record-11609077600), and draw two conclusions. One, \u201cThis must be extremely dangerous,\u201d or two, \u201cSurely I can get rich quick too.\u201d Human nature being what it is\u2026 For the latter, the civil engineer offers this advice on his Twitter page, \u201cIf you have no Tesla call options, you may want to do the math and consider using LEAPS as a way to accelerate your accumulation of Tesla stock. 40X in 2020. Another 50X by 2025.\u201d Whoa.\n\n*A* series of Q&A tweets ensues (thanks for the heads up [@RomanRubinstein](https://twitter.com/romanrubinstein?lang=en)) on which broker/dealers offer the most margin, the lowest interest rate on margin debt, and how to borrow the most money and obtain the maximum leverage by purchasing call options. \u201cMaintain margin value of 50% in my portfolio and the margin borrowing rides forever,\u201d goes the advice. Please consider the danger of heeding this advice. The engineer should risk-off and live a happy life.\n\nA whole bunch of people are going to lose a whole bunch of money.\n\nReading through a series of tweets among the Tesla (and others) option crowd, you see little, if any, mention of maintenance margin requirements. FINRA requires investors, strike that, speculators, to maintain equity of at least 25% of the value of an account. Leverage kills. Maintenance rates can be set above the minimum threshold. The concept of posting shares in stocks like $TSLA, $TWTR, or any established company trading for 20x or 30x sales & borrowing half of the value and then buying calls on the same shares posted as collateral is insanity. The only \u201cmath\u201d a speculator should be doing is knowing at what price against the shares in the account will new equity be required. Most brokers don\u2019t wait around for a customer to come up with new cash or securities to deposit. What do they do?\n\nThey sell down your shares to get to equity compliance. More decline? More forced selling. Depending on maintenance margin thresholds, you can lose it all in a hurry. Red flags are abundant, beyond simply the new record high in total margin and credit market debt outstanding. You can see the bubble in the number of single-contract call options outstanding, in the number of new retail accounts being opened with margin and allowed option trading, and even in the tone of surety by speculators regarding prospects for wildly expensive shares like Tesla.\n\nI never thought I\u2019d again see the kind of mania like we saw in the late 1990\u2019s, but here we are. Memories of what can and is likely to happen are long gone. Even a number of professional investors have suspended price as a key determinant of value.  A respected and well-known retired professional investor suggested on Twitter recently that I don\u2019t understand \u201c$TSLA growth math or basic investment theory,\u201d that \u201cstocks look forward, not backward\u201d and that \u201cP/E\u2019s are a function of exponential growth rates, not industry.\u201d\n\nThe last time an investment pro came unglued was January 2000 at a newspaper roundtable. The C.I.O/PM for one of the largest & oldest growth & income funds at the time took exception to the notion that $MSFT shareholders would lose money for the next 15 years, which they did. I\u2019d written 6 pages on the prediction in my 1/1/2000 letter (on the website) and discussed it at the roundtable. My co-panelist became unhinged because he and his firm had 5% of capital in $MSFT, which was then a $620B market cap on $20B in sales, 31x sales & 80x earnings.\n\nYou can apply the same logic to $TSLA or to any number of dangerously overvalued fashionable disruptive growers today. The Tesla bull proffering margined purchase of $TSLA LEAPS expects a $1,000 share price this year, $5,000 the next and $22,000 by 2025.\n\nNow, a $22,000 stock price, assuming no further dilution above today\u2019s 1.1B fully diluted shares outstanding, gets you to a $24 trillion market value, which must be reasonable given that the entire market value of the S&P 500 today is only \\~$31 trillion & global GDP is $88T. When your TAM (the new eyeballs) is 100% global auto market share, robotaxi, energy grid, insurance and economic population of Mars, no price is too high. No argument that Tesla has made great strides in manufacturing efficiency and are now producing a more reliable product.\n\nI also believe disruption of the auto industry will require an enormous amount of capital to grow and the established OEM\u2019s won\u2019t play dead. You can't simply separate auto margins and capital requirements from nearly infinite profitability earned by selling software upgrades. Shouldn\u2019t the upgrades be considered part of total vehicle cost? To what extent did the Apples and Microsofts of the world thrive on a regular upgrade cycle, much of which was and is planned. How often are you compelled into a new iPhone or iPad? Prior to the subscription model, at what point did Microsoft not support an older operating system or Office suite? Will EV buyers purchase a new car every 2-3 years? How much of the world can afford a more expensive vehicle than the current global average car price?\n\nRegardless of one's beliefs on business quality & growth prospects, paying a too-high price can destroy future investment return. #neversell? When price becomes ridiculous to the most optimistic business case you #bettersell. Price matters and the current environment is nuts. The current folly for price not mattering, or being justifiably high, reminds me of a well known sell-side report on Berkshire Hathaway in 1998 which assumed as undervalued both $BRK\u2019s shares and its stock portfolio against an assumed \u201creasonable\u201d 40x market multiple.\n\nBerkshire\u2019s shares, expensive, would fall by half over the next 18 months to a February 2000 low. It\u2019s become fashionable to explain investment process by saying price is the last consideration. Too often lately, price isn\u2019t even a consideration, especially for holy growers. While I did not have a short position on $MSFT in 2000, I do have a very small recent short on Tesla today so take my comments w/ a grain of salt. I did buy $MSFT in '06 after it fell by \\~75% and owned it for a decade, trimming when dear and adding to the position when cheap.\n\n*S*hort selling is very risky and those w/ sizable short positions on Tesla at the outset of 2020 would have suffered real damage given the 720% advance during the year. I've read that shorts lost $38B during '20 alone on their collective positions & short interest is way down. I happen to think the valuation is now so large to protect against a continued runaway price, particularly now that u/elonmusk secured its entry in the S&P 500 by engineering 4 quarters of profits by cutting R&D, SG&A and thanks to environmental credits courtesy $GM & $FCA.\n\nStill, I\u2019d never employ a large short position given unlimited downside and a max return of 100%. Margin is required against short positions. What appears to be a growing army of retail option traders, many employing sizable margin debt, is a recipe for disaster. Price and quality conscious investors get uncomfortable at times like these. I am extremely uncomfortable. I hope those that have no idea what they are doing heed growing and now very high risk and fully understand downside and what margin calls and maintenance margin mean.\n\nMany, many speculators will lose much and even all of their money at some point as this bubble breaks. Now is the time to reduce risk. You could feel badly for employees that were paid in non-qualified stock options and kept their shares upon exercise in the late 1990\u2019s. When shares plummeted in the wake of the tech bubble the tax liability due on gain realized as income upon exercise was still due and payable, despite shares that were way below the exercise price. It was bad. Many lost everything but weren\u2019t in a position to understand risk.\n\nBorrowing against Tesla (or any) shares and buying call options presents serious deliberately assumed risk. For perspective, a 92% decline takes the shares back to where they started 2020! With margin, it will take way less than a 92% decline to introduce wipeout.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n***Responding to the PM who claims that the $TSLA price target of $1,200, total EV adoption of 20%, and 5% market share in global auto-manufacturing is reasonable, Bloomstran had this to say:***\n\nYou have EV adoption rising from 3% to 20% in five years, a 6x increase (46% CAGR) and Tesla market share at 25%. 2019 global new vehicle sales totaled \\~95m units and will be way lower this year. Let's call 2020 a throwaway for the industry, and hats off to [$TSLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click) for growing. From the 2019 base, if we assume 4% market growth then new global units in 2025 would be 115m and at your expected 20% share Tesla would sell 29 million vehicles. Is this your assumption? Sounds aggressive given Tesla\u2019s 500k unit run rate for 2020 and 1/2% market share.\n\nNow, US new vehicle prices are $38k but significantly lower worldwide, let\u2019s say $30k per vehicle sold globally. The average Tesla looks to range from high $30k\u2019s for the Model 3 to $55k for the Model 3 Performance to $125k for the Model X Performance fully loaded.  What do you expect for an average selling price for Tesla in 2025? I\u2019d presume that as market share expands ASP\u2019s will have to fall to affordable. I\u2019m trying to get to a revenue number.\n\nPerhaps the governments of the world will be giving $2k per person, $8k per family of 4 in annual perpetuity, surely making new cars more affordable! If Tesla sells 29m units in 2025 @ $34.5k per unit, that gets sales to $1 trillion, a CAGR of \\~102% for five years. Reasonable?\n\nMoving on, you have a 2025 EPS target of $24/share. On how many shares shall we apply your expected per-share figure? Shares outstanding at 9/30 totaled 948m, up from 905m at yearend 2019. An additional $5B in shares were sold recently to the public in \u201cat-the-market\u201d sales.  The sales were done with no roadshow, risk disclosure or prospectus, unless Goldman\u2019s report upgrading the shares from neutral to buy & a new price target of $780, up from $455, issued days before the announced sale and Goldman\u2019s retention as selling agent, as a \u201cprospectus.\"\n\nIf the shares were sold at an average of \\~$600/share, the share count would now be 8.3m shares higher, so call the total 956m. You have a price target of $1,200 for the shares, so let\u2019s not forget to include in the count any option and RSU shares issued but not yet exercised.  Recall, [*@elonmusk*](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) was granted 20m option shares (now 100m thanks to the split) in 2018 by [*@larryellison*](https://twitter.com/larryellison) and Elon\u2019s associates on the board. Fully diluted shares total 1.113B right now, and if the stock keeps rising we can assume all options will be exercised and outstanding.\n\nSo, how many shares should we apply to your $24 EPS target? If we assume zero further dilution (realistic?), then using the 1.113B fully diluted shares including the recent $5b sale, we get to $26.7B in net income. On an even $1 trillion in revenues, that\u2019s a 2.67% profit margin, just a bit higher than the auto industry average of 3% and approaching $MSFT\u2019s 30%.\n\nOne last missing piece of information, which I haven\u2019t seen mentioned by the Tesla bulls or in your message to me is how much capital will be required to grow sales from 500k units to 29m over the next 5 years?  It looks like over the history of [$TSLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click) the company has raised $26.5B in equity capital (including the recent $5B) and $16.5B in debt and preferred equity, so a total of $43B. Tesla has a cumulative loss of $5.7B, so it hasn\u2019t produced a positive return on capital.\n\nFor its last 4 quarters GAAP profits totaled $556M, which yields a 2.5% return on capital (equity net of retained losses plus debt minus cash, all adjusted for the recent $5B sale). I fully understand companies can surely lose money or earn little profit as they scale.  With the recent sale of $5B Tesla now has \\~$20B in cash. Is this sufficient to finance its growth over the next 5 years as the company grows units by 102% per year?\n\nSince I don\u2019t lean on brevity and given my lack of understanding of basic investment theory, let\u2019s summarize the missing data points necessary to get the stock to your target of $1,200 per share, 50 times your 2025 EPS target of $24 per share. Needed: 1) Tesla unit sales in 2025? 2) Average selling price per unit? 3) Any non-auto related sales \u2013 insurance, robotaxi, insurance, energy sales? 4) Shares outstanding? 5) Total capital: Additional paid in capital, debt, preferred equity, cash?\n\nAt your 50x $24 EPS $1,200  price target, [$TSLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click) returns 11.2% pa from Thursday\u2019s $705.67 close. I happen to think shares in [$BRK](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BRK&src=cashtag_click), my largest holding, are likely to compound at roughly that rate, assuming a 10% ROE and a terminal price at 1.3x book value, up from \\~1.2x today.", "author_fullname": "t2_8oukh8l1", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Laying out the Tesla bear case, a summary", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kpbe24", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 52, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 52, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1609693718.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609668904.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Before diving in, a few housekeeping items:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>I didn&#39;t write this.</strong> Everything below has been copied and pasted from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisBloomstran/status/1345155266468306944\">Chris Bloomstran</a>&#39;s Twitter feed, which has trended for the past day.

Let&#39;s call 2020 a throwaway for the industry, and hats off to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click\">$TSLA</a> for growing. From the 2019 base, if we assume 4% market growth then new global units in 2025 would be 115m and at your expected 20% share Tesla would sell 29 million vehicles. Is this your assumption? Sounds aggressive given Tesla\u2019s 500k unit run rate for 2020 and 1/2% market share.</p>\n\n<p>Now, US new vehicle prices are $38k but significantly lower worldwide, let\u2019s say $30k per vehicle sold globally. The average Tesla looks to range from high $30k\u2019s for the Model 3 to $55k for the Model 3 Performance to $125k for the Model X Performance fully loaded.  What do you expect for an average selling price for Tesla in 2025? I\u2019d presume that as market share expands ASP\u2019s will have to fall to affordable. I\u2019m trying to get to a revenue number.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the governments of the world will be giving $2k per person, $8k per family of 4 in annual perpetuity, surely making new cars more affordable! If Tesla sells 29m units in 2025 @ $34.5k per unit, that gets sales to $1 trillion, a CAGR of ~102% for five years. Reasonable?</p>\n\n<p>Moving on, you have a 2025 EPS target of $24/share. On how many shares shall we apply your expected per-share figure? Shares outstanding at 9/30 totaled 948m, up from 905m at yearend 2019. An additional $5B in shares were sold recently to the public in \u201cat-the-market\u201d sales.  The sales were done with no roadshow, risk disclosure or prospectus, unless Goldman\u2019s report upgrading the shares from neutral to buy &amp; a new price target of $780, up from $455, issued days before the announced sale and Goldman\u2019s retention as selling agent, as a \u201cprospectus.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>If the shares were sold at an average of ~$600/share, the share count would now be 8.3m shares higher, so call the total 956m. You have a price target of $1,200 for the shares, so let\u2019s not forget to include in the count any option and RSU shares issued but not yet exercised.  Recall, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk\"><em>@elonmusk</em></a> was granted 20m option shares (now 100m thanks to the split) in 2018 by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/larryellison\"><em>@larryellison</em></a> and Elon\u2019s associates on the board. Fully diluted shares total 1.113B right now, and if the stock keeps rising we can assume all options will be exercised and outstanding.</p>\n\n<p>So, how many shares should we apply to your $24 EPS target? If we assume zero further dilution (realistic?), then using the 1.113B fully diluted shares including the recent $5b sale, we get to $26.7B in net income. On an even $1 trillion in revenues, that\u2019s a 2.67% profit margin, just a bit higher than the auto industry average of 3% and approaching $MSFT\u2019s 30%.</p>\n\n<p>One last missing piece of information, which I haven\u2019t seen mentioned by the Tesla bulls or in your message to me is how much capital will be required to grow sales from 500k units to 29m over the next 5 years?  It looks like over the history of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click\">$TSLA</a> the company has raised $26.5B in equity capital (including the recent $5B) and $16.5B in debt and preferred equity, so a total of $43B. Tesla has a cumulative loss of $5.7B, so it hasn\u2019t produced a positive return on capital.</p>\n\n<p>For its last 4 quarters GAAP profits totaled $556M, which yields a 2.5% return on capital (equity net of retained losses plus debt minus cash, all adjusted for the recent $5B sale). I fully understand companies can surely lose money or earn little profit as they scale.  With the recent sale of $5B Tesla now has ~$20B in cash. Is this sufficient to finance its growth over the next 5 years as the company grows units by 102% per year?</p>\n\n<p>Since I don\u2019t lean on brevity and given my lack of understanding of basic investment theory, let\u2019s summarize the missing data points necessary to get the stock to your target of $1,200 per share, 50 times your 2025 EPS target of $24 per share. Needed: 1) Tesla unit sales in 2025? 2) Average selling price per unit? 3) Any non-auto related sales \u2013 insurance, robotaxi, insurance, energy sales? 4) Shares outstanding? 5) Total capital: Additional paid in capital, debt, preferred equity, cash?</p>\n\n<p>At your 50x $24 EPS $1,200  price target, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click\">$TSLA</a> returns 11.2% pa from Thursday\u2019s $705.67 close. I happen to think shares in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BRK&amp;src=cashtag_click\">$BRK</a>, my largest holding, are likely to compound at roughly that rate, assuming a 10% ROE and a terminal price at 1.3x book value, up from ~1.2x today.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/O0gdfOzPGHcnP6wuehLdiC-gHcvH-LeCg7u9i1fv2O8.jpg?auto=webp&s=a7fd14ac7f9e189ad044731fd720b9b7ace34554", "width": 140, "height": 140}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/O0gdfOzPGHcnP6wuehLdiC-gHcvH-LeCg7u9i1fv2O8.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d8687090bc68033edb211e30994ed74c567561cc", "width": 108, "height": 108}], "variants": {}, "id": "E83aKBI-RrVXOhzipbaPlwifMHUiMnZg__E518p3O0I"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "5692ce02-b860-11e5-b542-0edc7016bbd3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#365b8c", "id": "kpbe24", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": {"name": "InstagramStockTrader", "fullname": "t2_8oukh8l1"}, "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 115, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kpbe24/laying_out_the_tesla_bear_case_a_summary/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kpbe24/laying_out_the_tesla_bear_case_a_summary/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1764300, "created_utc": 1609640104.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false, "comment_limit": 2048, "comment_sort": "confidence", "comments": [{"total_awards_received": 1, "approved_at_utc": null, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 40, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_kpbe24", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ghw7t6w", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "author": {"name": "myNameIsPDT", "fullname": "t2_6jgbnm9i"}, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_kpbe24", "score": 40, "author_fullname": "t2_6jgbnm9i", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "coin_price": 150, "id": "award_f44611f1-b89e-46dc-97fe-892280b13b82", "penny_donate": null, "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png", "days_of_premium": 0, "icon_height": 2048, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=16&height=16&auto=webp&s=a5662dfbdb402bf67866c050aa76c31c147c2f45", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=32&height=32&auto=webp&s=a6882eb3f380e8e88009789f4d0072e17b8c59f1", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=48&height=48&auto=webp&s=e50064b090879e8a0b55e433f6ee61d5cb5fbe1d", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=64&height=64&auto=webp&s=8e5bb2e76683cb6b161830bcdd9642049d6adc11", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=128&height=128&auto=webp&s=eda4a9246f95f42ee6940cc0ec65306fd20de878", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Thank you stranger.

It\u2019s hard to imagine the kind of bet this was at the time, the risk can\u2019t be understated. But it was the right bet. A lot of people were proven wrong, and Tesla changed the auto world in the process.\n\nBut the bet has now changed. To believe in Tesla continuing to ascend from from currently implied prices, one must believe in Tesla\u2019s competitiveness across disciplines and more importantly, one must believe that Elon is correct on Tesla\u2019s approach to full self driving and that it will be achieved and executed broadly as well as Elon says it will be, and that Tesla is roughly as close as Elon says.\n\nTo be clear no one knows that answer. Hence the risk and hence the upside.\n\nI\u2019m not betting on Tesla because I see a new risk that\u2019s being underrated. Let\u2019s assume Elon is right on the most important thing, his approach to FSD. That\u2019s not a safe assumption but for a moment let\u2019s grant it. Let\u2019s then assume Tesla is way ahead which is fairly safe to say if Elon is right. In this absolute best case scenario, no one knows how long the transition to FSD will take. Elon himself has been wrong. He corrects his timeline linearly (adding a year or two) but the fact that progress is exponential means that he\u2019s been exponentially wrong. Edge cases are really really hard. So despite what he says he literally has no clue. And this is before we get to talk about solving the politics and legalities of it.\n\nMeanwhile there really is competition. VWAG is already finding success with the Taycan which is slowing Model S sales. The ETron GT will make this worse. Then in 24 months there will be the next gen Macan which will be an EV. Those are three big examples but there are many more. Long story short, if the Model S is anything to go by, Tesla\u2019s current approach of not needing to update a car and relying on a range advantage will not work indefinitely. \n\nThe risk is easily to understand: First, at some point, range becomes enough so even if Tesla is (significantly) ahead on range it\u2019s no longer the big deal it once was. Especially since customers consider more than just range. Second and more importantly, the same is true for FSD. Even in this best case scenario Tesla could be way ahead, 90% there vs the competition being only 70%. But due to the exponential nature of the problem, it\u2019s way harder to go from 90-95% than it is to go from 70-75%. What this means is by the time Tesla gets to say 95% the competition could easily get to 75%. And for consumers that could be enough to where the difference- which is *technically* huge- *practically* doesn\u2019t matter to them enough to differentiate the Tesla product to the extent that Tesla needs. Remember that last 10% lies in edge cases. \n\nThe end result of all of this is a world where Elon could still be correct but timing is everything. If what is happening to the Model S happens to the Mode Y and then 3, before Tesla achieves FSD, the valuation cannot truly be justified. And this is just one very simplified scenario.\n\nSo if you\u2019re buying Tesla now, which everyone who\u2019s holding Tesla is, you\u2019re buying into something very different than you would have been buying into a few years ago. You\u2019re buying multiple disciplines that will keep Tesla competitive such as Teslas ability to rapidly achieve competitive world class manufacturing. You\u2019re buying Tesla\u2019s platform update approach. And most importantly you\u2019re buying Elon\u2019s predictions on FSD and Tesla\u2019s ability to execute on it against the clock. \n\nI\u2019m not a Tesla bear in that I don\u2019t think the company will fold. I think Tesla is here to stay. I simply think there\u2019s enough clear evidence that the current bet is not only extremely different from prior, but that it\u2019s going to be dramatically harder for Tesla to live up to, never mind exceed, its valuation going forward than it was to get to this point. And yes there are the usual concepts of \u201cit\u2019s hard for big companies to grow\u201d, or \u201cthey always want to see you fail\u201d. And it may or may not be true. But this isn\u2019t that. \n\nGood luck to those who continue to bet on Tesla.
