See below.\n\nSales team:\n\nEssentially Palantir in the 17 years of existence, only has had a sales team for 1.5 years. The reasoning behind this is because internally, Palantir did not want to go the whole sales route of software but recently, that they needed to if they ever wanted to go public and thus reward their share holders. Since the sales team is so new, one can say that they are essentially a new company in that they are in the early years of growth. Palantir also finally has built out their Foundry Platform and Apollo platforms over the years and are now ready to ramp up a lot of customers quickly.\n\nEfficiency / Apollo:\n\nPalantir as a company has become extremely more efficient the past 1-2 years when it comes to acquiring new customers and ramping them up. The reasoning behind this is their Apollo Platform. It\u2019s an in house platform that uses ML to help get a customer up and going a lot faster than previously. In the past, Palantir would have to send \u201cforward deployed engineers\u201d to customers to get them up and running and that could take weeks / months and is costly. Now With Apollo, Palantir can get a customer up and running in hours without sending anyone. This frees up cash for Palantir the invest back into R&D. Also wanted to mention, during the last Q3 earnings call, an analyst asked the headcount growth for the company. Most high growth companies tend to hire a lot of ppl to keep that growth rate up. A company doing that that comes to mind is Snowflake. Palantir\u2019s CFO said that their headcount is only growing 2-3% and mostly in the sales department. The reasoning of this is directly due to Apollo. Palantir\u2019s employees have become more efficient and that with Apollo, they can onboard a lot of customers without hiring more expensive engineers.\n\nPalantir Modules:\n\nOn the Q3 earnings call, Palantir alluded to an ERP type Modules for Foundry that they are working on so that customers can pick and choose which aspects of Foundry they want, instead of getting the whole suite. This is great because it\u2019s way cheaper for a company to get started with Palantir\u2019s software and then slowly ramp up with more options. Palantir has a very high retention rate with their software so by having a company only pick 1-2 modules, it most likely will result in getting more and more modules which in turns create more revenue for PLTR. I suspect they will talk about this come the Demo day.\n\nFinal thoughts.\n\nPalantir has great leadership and are very smart people. They are very methodical in their planning. This company is 100% a long term hold. Think 5-10 years at least. They only had a sales team for 1.5 years and already will have over $1B in sales with virtually no sales team.
