{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "DISCLAIMER: I\u2019m not a douche who\u2019s going to pretend I did any of this. I did nothing other than ask a friend who has experience with the company what he thought about them. He has a background and degree related to finance and a MASSIVE amount of knowledge on investing. He\u2019s a an absolute GOD of DD. He had written this all the way back in OCTOBER. Without further intro, here\u2019s a bunch of awesome DD. TL;DR: PLTR to the fucking \ud83c\udf1d \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\n*Profitability*\n\nPrice to sales is high, coming in at 15.63. Compared to some of their competitors (listed below), the average for the industry is below 2. Said differently, investors are paying a high premium for the rapid growth in revenue and the hope that the industry will explode someday. The key questions are will the AI industry expand and how much of this market will be funneled into Palantir, both commercially and from the government. \n\nTheir revenue is growing quickly. Over the past year it has grown 21.27% and over the prior three years it has a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.83%.\n\nCash flow and net income are both negative, but they are improving. Their net income has increased by 20% over the past year and their free cash flow has increased by 64.41%. \n\nNet profit margins are also still negative, but increased 32.63% over the prior year. One thing about their margins is that they definitely live a lavish life style at their workplace. The food is free, the equipment is expensive, and the amenities are abundant\u2014having observed this, they absolutely attract some of the best employees around. \n\nA nice segway into the balance sheet is to talk about their accounts receivable (A/R). Their ability to collect money consistently and accurately are impressive, with only $5 million in A/R for this year and only $2 million in A/R last year. \n\n*Balance Sheet*\n\nThe company has a book value of $791.47 million and sells at a P/B of ~21.10. This is high for a traditional value or growth play, but is not absurd for technology companies.\n\nTheir current and quick ratio are 2.78 and 2.65, respectively. This is impressive\u2014for safety, a rule of thumb I use is a current ratio above 1.5 and a quick ratio above 1. Anything over 2 ensures a high probability of survival during difficult times. Also, the company barely has any money tied up in restricted cash, allowing them to allocate money to working capital more easily and preventing liquidity crises. But it is not as rosy as it seems. I will talk about the preferred securities shortly. \n\nThe company has $1.08 billion in short-term cash and cash equivalents. Their short-term (> 1 year) liabilities are $730 million and their total liabilities are $3.57 billion. The D/E ratio is impressive, hovering around .39. The larger contractors usually have a D/E ratio above 1-1.5, with the exception of Raytheon. \n\nOne thing that is not shown in the D/E ratio is something I mentioned in a prior paragraph, the preferred stock. This is a problem because preferred shares act very similar to debt. They currently have $2.13 billion in preferred shares outstanding, and I am not sure how many of those are convertible. If we add that to the debt, their new D/E ratio is over 2, putting it higher than most defense contractors. \n\n*Compensation / Dilution*\n\nCurrently, the company has $1.6 billion shares outstanding from their direct listing. On top of that, they have approximately 2.17 billion diluted shares. Said differently, if all options and convertible securities are activated, that is the potential number of shares outstanding. For any company this is an extreme amount of dilution and something Warren Buffet warns value investors about. The engineers and executives are highly compensated through their 250 million+ stock option program, as well as the preferred security holders. \n\n*Insider Selling*\n\nOne thing we never like to see is insider selling. The CEO has sold 11% of his stake, or 14.1 million shares, for $135 million. Cofounder Peter Thiel sold even more, ~$365 million. Nonetheless, the CEO still has the majority of his holdings and will be issued more stock if the company reaches goals in the future. This is something I am not too excited about, but it is not a major red flag because it was a small amount and perhaps he just wanted some cash\u2014he has been working hard for 17 years awaiting this day. \n\n*Competitors*\n\nWhen it comes to direct competitors (contractors that specialize in AI), it appears that Leidos, Raytheon, and FireEye stand out the most. However, looking at the defense contracting industry as a whole, Lockheed, Boeing, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman also present threats. Interestingly, there are arguments online that Palantir is extra risky because ~half of their revenue comes from US Government contracts, but this is a common characteristic for many of the defense contractors that I listed above, even Boeing. \n\n*Valuation*\n\nI will base my valuation on them staying negative cash flow in the coming three years then netting X amount of cash flow for a few scenarios. I can send you the excel document if you want. I will summarize below. My discount rate is 8% (which is high, but conservative) and my growth rate is 7% (which is also somewhat optimistic). \n\nWhen it comes to cash flow, I have estimated they will stay negative for three years then slowly work up to $100 million. I will assign different values to their perpetual cash flow after 10 years below keeping the growth rate and discount rate the same. Two major things can happen to mess up the calculations. The growth rate could be higher or lower and the amount of cash flow could be higher or lower.  \n\nSlowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $100 million annually: $10.9 billion\nSlowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $150 million annually: $16.263 billion\nSlowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $200 million annually: $21.613 billion\nSlowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $250 million annually: $26.963 billion\nSlowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $300 million annually: $32.213 billion\nSlowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $350 million annually: $37.663 billion\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to value a company that is in such an early stage based off cash flow. We have no idea how much cash flow they will bring in, how much the industry will grow, or where interest rates will be. Nonetheless, doing this analysis is sobering and dampens expectations. \n\n*Other Topics*\n\nTheir recruiting and the quality of engineers and computer scientists are similar to that of Tesla. People in the industry know this is a difficult company to work for. Their interviewing process is unique and difficult, usually encompassing a difficult task using their software (i.e. here is a bunch of data; find the terrorist using Gotham). \n\nAnother interesting thing to look at is a top-down, or macro, approach to the industry. \n\nHere are some interesting points:\n1. The US military budget is ~$689.6 billion, and this will likely increase or stay the same in the future\n2. AI accounted for ~$4 billion of this budget\n3. Cyber security accounted for ~$9.85 billion \n4. Palantir receives approximately half their revenue from government contracts, which is ~$500 million\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the combined budget for AI and cybersecurity grows to $20 billion ($5 billion higher than it is now) in the future, which I think is reasonable. If Palantir is one of the leaders in this industry and accumulate 5% of that $20 billion budget, that would be $1 billion from government contracts, not including their fast growth in the commercial industry. These numbers are conservative, as I think the allocation for AI and cyber could be closer to $50-$100 billion someday. This is where the opportunity is and the commercial side is just icing on the cake. \n\nIf Palantir becomes the leader and the world trends more to cybersecurity and AI, there is potential to make money. \n\nFinally, I would like to speak about my personal experience with the company. I have used many intelligence tools, but only two stand out to me. Palantir is one of them and it is a cut above its peers. The beauty, capability, and analysis tools are unmatched. It is user-friendly but I wouldn\u2019t say anyone on the street could stand up and use it. I am not sure their plans, but they could modify it and use it for so many applications in the business world. This is something I hope they do.\n\n\nGood luck you retards", "author_fullname": "t2_s7ay4", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "PLTR DD that a good friend of mine did", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kpqxnd", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 81, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 81, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609730503.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>DISCLAIMER: I\u2019m not a douche who\u2019s going to pretend I did any of this.
