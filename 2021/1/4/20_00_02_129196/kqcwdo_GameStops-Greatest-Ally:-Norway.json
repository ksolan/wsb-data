Norway joined the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and was a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949.

For context, Melvin Capital only has $20b (**2% of Norway\u2019s strength**) \n\n\n\n[Screenshot of GME's Top Holders. Norway owns 1.8 million shares of GME](https://preview.redd.it/gqrrm1c0ic961.png?width=439&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd767f9ed61c1afe1ec9312dee41568b6c5fa34f)\n\n\n\nThat means Norway is by far the **largest** and **strongest** retard in the room, and he has yet to wake up\n\n\n\nBut this is where things get interesting \ud83d\ude80 \n\n\n\nYou see, Norway\u2019s National Fund (SPU)'s goal is to \u201cinvest with an **extremely long-term perspective**, enabling it to cope with big swings in value in the short term. The goal of the fund on behalf of the Norwegian people is to generate the **highest possible return** with only moderate risk so that the fund grows and endures\u201d\n\n\n\nThe fund only invests in companies with an extremely long-term perspective, and yet GameStop is one of them. You see, Norway\u2019s National Fund currently owns 1.8 million shares which **represents 2.5% of voting rights**. On top of that, the fund is an **active participant in shareholder and proxy votes**. They frequently \u201chave a regular dialogue with these nearly 1,000 companies\u201d regarding shareholder decisions. They take the effort to be involved in their investments and will be active voting participants. \n\n\n\n*Where was Norway When the Buy Wall Fell?* \n\n\n\n**Ryan Cohen** \ud83d\ude80  can call upon the alliances of old, our loyal ally Norway \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf4. With the partnership of the century, the fund could increase their investment by a **small $100m** which would be enough to purchase another **5 million shares** (at a very conservative price of $25/share). This would be enough shares to bring **Norway\u2019s National Fund to a 10% owner** (1.8m shares previous + 5 million new shares = 6.8 million shares out of 68 million outstanding). Norway  could then partner with Ryan Cohen to pull off the ultimate power play of our life time. \ud83d\ude80   **This purchase would represent less than 0.01% of the fund\u2019s over $1 trillion in assets, and would be hardly a drop in the bucket, but the move would give the fund a large upside exposure to the booming Gaming Industry.** As part of the partnership with Ryan Cohen, Norway could even become the center of gaming for all of Europe, with Norway hosting e-gaming tournaments, conferences, and events. GameStop could even partner with Norwegian gaming companies for partnerships during their e-commerce pivot. Imagine an annual gaming conference held in Norway on behalf of GameStop showcasing the latest in the gaming industry coupled with an e-gaming tournament for the coveted \u201cGameStop Championship\u201d. Ryan Cohen could hand out awards and accolades during the annual event, further boosting the GameStop brand name. You could even have the **King of Norway** \ud83d\udc51 (yes they have a king still) crown the champions for further publicity and even more PR stunts. GameStop is the brand name and recognition that everyone needs in order to launch themselves into the future of the gaming industry. \n\n\n\nYou see, Gamers around the world have yet to be united under a single gaming hub, one brand name to encompass everything gaming to include buying games, consoles, hardware, swag, but also a brand for hosting, organizing, and sponsoring e-gaming events while also partnering with game developers to forge the future of gaming. GameStop could truly be the \u201cstop\u201d for all our gaming needs. \n\n\n\nWith **Ryan Cohen and Norway combined owning nearly 25% of GameStop**, (and Ryan CEO with the blessing of Norway), shorts would completely back down, **decisively outgunned by the $1 trillion mega whale that is Norway**. This move alone would instantly trigger the short squeeze \ud83d\ude80, but there\u2019s still more to come which would leave the short squeeze as an after thought; the opening flame to the beginning of something new and awe inspiring.\n\n\n\n GameStop, absent the bears and shorts dragging it down would see a total transformation from brick and mortar store into the digital gaming world entering the future as the face and central hub of the gaming world; as GameStop was always destined to be \ud83d\ude80 \n\n\n\nWith this move, GameStop would **\\*instantly\\* squeeze** and flush out all of the short sellers and bears. Melvin and the army of shorts \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b would be defeated (and bankrupted). Once the dust settles post squeeze, GameStop would easily settle in around at $50-$60 share price due to the market pricing in the new and unlimited upside potential. After RC takes the helm as the **captain of the rocket ship** \ud83d\ude80, GME will continue to grow as it transforms and executes its vision, eventually surpassing $100 per share and onwards to $250 per share and beyond in the future years. GameStop would conquer the gaming world \ud83d\ude80  \n\n\n\nNorway could easily see their $100m investment return 2x-5x netting them a healthy $200m-$500m profit (perhaps upwards of $1.25 billion in the next few years) while also bringing additional money and business opportunities to Norwegian companies making the move way too good of an opportunity to pass up. A small 0.01% investment would net Norway easily a 200% to 1000% return (ROI) while also boosting the Norwegian economy, helping Norwegian gaming companies, tech companies, and tourism industries. \n\n\n\nWe humble degenerates would simply be along for the ride of a lifetime \ud83d\ude80 \n\n\n\nTLDR; Ryan Cohen partners with Norway to spends 0.01% of their portfolio and buy more GME shares.
