{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "As of late, Democrats have surged in the Georgia Senate run-offs, which could spell big trouble for tech companies sporting lofty valuations, especially non-profitable ones.\n\nSo why exactly does a Blue Wave spell trouble for tech companies?\n\nA couple reasons: more fiscal spending, higher inflation expectations, higher interest rates, less valuable long-term cashflows, tech trade crowding, and hedge fund leverage. Let me explain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fiscal Spending, Inflation, and Interest Rates**\n\nGenerally speaking, Democratic policy favors a large government budget, and with hopes to spend over\u00a0$5T on clean energy/infrastructure, education, and healthcare Biden's team isn't breaking from the mold. A blue wave would make it much easier for the Biden administration to enact these policies. While Biden is planning on increasing taxes by $3.4T to offset his spending, the government still needs to create money to finance these projects, which\u00a0leads to inflation. Moreover, the Fed has taken a newly lax stance on its price stability mandate, and is\u00a0welcoming inflation of more than 2%, so it won't hesitate to let prices run hot to achieve its inflation target. 10 yr bond yields (and interest rates broadly) tend to be highly correlated to measures of inflation, as its a natural way to dampen the acceleration of rising prices.\u00a0\n\nSummary: dem sweep = higher fiscal spending = higher inflation = higher interest rates\n\n**How This Affects Tech Stock Valuation**\n\nFor all the retards who have never taken a finance course or don't understand basic valuation techniques, the essence of stock valuation is projecting future free cash flows and discounting them back at a risk adjusted rate (b/c $1 is worth more today than $1 five yrs from now, and there's not 100% certainty in the CFs the company might produce in the future). Thus, the main determinant of a company's value is its profitability, the rate at which you discount the company's cash flows, and the time horizon you analyze it at (which can be related to the discount rate). For those actually interested, you can read more\u00a0here. With the current fed funds rate pinned between 0% and .25% and the 10yr yield less than 1%, you can practically look out at a time horizon of 10-20 years before discounting back cash flows. Though still a stretch, interest rates at this level might be able to justify some of the 30-50x price/sales multiples we see in certain growthy tech names at the moment (DDOG's, CRWD's, etc).\u00a0\n\nThat said, if interest rates do begin to rise as a result of a blue sweep, and analysts are forced to incorporate risk free rates of 2-3+% into their discount rates at time horizons where these companies generate little profit, tech companies could see their valuation multiples deteriorate by 50+%. Even just pre-Covid valuation multiples for some growthy names would absolutely crush their stock price. I understand Covid brought forward significant demand for tech companies and in many ways permanently altered consumer behavior, but much of the rise of these companies is based on pure multiple expansion on the basis of forward revenues (not even earnings!), assuming low discount rates and near-infinite time horizons.\u00a0\n\n**Crowded Long Tech Trade**\n\nIt's no real surprise, but according to a December BofA survey, the long technology strategy is the most popular/crowded among fund managers. Also, a year-end Morgan Stanley report indicated that hedge fund gross and net exposure was near all-time highs at 100% and 96%ile, respectively.\n\n**A Quick Note on Leverage**\n\nHedge funds use leverage to amplify returns, and when leverage is cheap (see above), they are more keen to do so. If a hedge fund is levered at 2x, it has $100 of capital to support $200 of positions. A 10% drawdown would leave the fund with $80 of capital to support $180 of positions, with a new leverage multiple of 2.25x. If this were to happen, the fund would have to sell roughly 20% of its book to maintain its leverage ratio. In such a crowded trade, selling like this would cause another fund to liquidate a portion of its holdings to not become over levered, and this self-sustaining cycle of selling persists. An example of this price action and positive feedback loop is the \"Quant Quake\" of 2007 though its trade was less crowded and firms were probably more highly levered.\n\n**Conclusion/TLDR**\n\nA blue wave and higher interest rates (or even the fear/expectation thereof) could quickly unravel the long technology trade due to its crowding, leverage, and a newfound preference for shorter duration cash flows, crushing the stock prices of many tech companies, especially those that are unprofitable in the near term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Apologies for the lack of images. I've been trying to post this with images since Sunday night. My computer is acting screwy and I can't get anything to upload. I know some of you retards can't read, so tough luck if that's you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positions**\n\nQQQ $300p 1/29\n\nCRWD $200p 1/29\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: This is not financial guidance, but merely for the purpose of discussion. Also, both of the above positions are hedges against a large sell-off, and do not represent me YOLOing my life savings.
