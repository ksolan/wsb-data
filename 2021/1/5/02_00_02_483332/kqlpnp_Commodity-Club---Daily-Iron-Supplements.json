Time for your daily vitamins - here's a bit of iron for you. \n\nFirst - let's check in on Iron Ore spot prices: \n\n* US Futures - [Link](https://www.investing.com/commodities/iron-ore-62-cfr-futures)\n   * Look at Contracts - $164/ton for January and holding $150/ton through May\n* Shipping Rates - [Link](https://twitter.com/HELLENICSHIP/status/1346134717607849997?s=20)\n   * Hitting $167/ton at the port\n* Yearly Outlook - [Link](https://twitter.com/AnaliseEnergia/status/1346053710397452289?s=20)\n   * Here we can see that May and September have the most volume and OI - they will drive Q2 and Q3\n   * Prices are holding over CNY1,000/ton through May and CNY950/ton through September. That's an incredible price for any miner. \n\nSecond - let's check in on relevant news: \n\n* Shipping/Exports - [Link](https://www.mining.com/iron-ore-shipments-from-brazil-and-australia-set-record-high/)\n   * Exports from Brazil/Australia are near ATH despite high prices\n   * For context - $VALE shipped about 6m tons of iron for the last week of December. At $160/ton, that's nearly $1b in revenue for a week. VALE is expected to have about $11b in revenue for the quarter, which also takes into consideration all their other commodities (e.g. Nickel, which was up 5% today on spot). \n   * Shipping prices (Baltic Dry Index) are also near ATH despite heavy volume\n* India - [Link](https://www.mysteel.net/article/5020628/Indian-Steel-Association-writes-to-PM-defending-price-hike.html)\n   * Not priced in, and shouldn't be, but local Indian companies are complaining about the price hikes that China is causing on a global scale. India is a huge exporter of iron, and are proposing a 6 month ban on iron exports to stabilize domestic prices. \n* China - [Link](https://www.mysteel.net/article/5020661/China-resumes-imports-of-steel-scrap-meeting-new-standards.html)\n   * Couple things going on here:\n\n1. China recently allowed for importing scrap steel to help shore up the lacking supply\n2. China steel plants are running at full capacity despite high input prices for both met coal and iron ore - surprisingly prices are being pushed to consumers instead of steel producers. The customer in this case is the Chinese government \n3. China relations with India and Australia are soured - China is beating out Indian companies for contracts by selling at ridiculously low prices and China/Australia have an ongoing price war\n\nThings to look out for: \n\n1. Changes in the May/September futures for Iron Ore (input #1) \n2. Changes in Met Coal prices (input #2) \n3. Changes shipping prices (input #3) \n\nRight now I'm playing $VALE for Iron Ore and $TECK for Met Coal. I've posted about $TECK in other posts - know they have 11% ownership by the China Investment Corporation.
