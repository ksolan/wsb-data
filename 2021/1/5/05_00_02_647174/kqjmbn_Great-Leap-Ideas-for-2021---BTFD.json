{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Stocks broadly dipped today (Jan 4), and tomorrow, the positions will likely dip further because of uncertainty over the GA runoff elections. But fear not and BTFD. Here're some top picks:  \n\n\n1. NIO. Just released its December 2020 delivery numbers yesterday, and as expected, they killed it. 121% increase in deliveries for 2020. Deliveries doubled year-over-year. There are also rumors that Nio will open its first non-Chinese store in Copenhagen, Denmark. It's comfortably over $50 today. I predict $60+ by Nio Day. Furthermore, I predict over $100 by eoy. Anything below $45 looks good rn. Weeklies might be worth it, but to be safe, go for leaps.   \n\n2. JMIA. This is the African Alibaba-Amazon. I'm being a touch anecdotal, but I bought BABA when it was $60/share, and while waiting for its meteoric rise, BABA received the same criticism 12 years ago that JMIA is getting now (\\[China's\\] infrastructure is weak! They're not tech-savvy! They're not revenue positive!), I also see parallel upsides: JMIA knows its customers. It services over 12 countries and has a customer base of 1.2-Billion people. That's more customers than what Alibaba has in China. Furthermore, JMIA's platform has a payment system like Alipay, a food delivery service like DoorDash, and a travel booking service like Expedia all bundled in one platform that happens to also be one of the most popular websites/mobile apps in Africa.   \nJMIA will monopolize many industries in the large and rapidly growing continent of Africa. MasterCard and Goldman Sachs are some of their investors. The two co-ceo's (Europeans) formerly worked at McKinsey, and their African co-founder is a Harvard MBA alum and successful entrepreneur. Fun fact: Alibaba outcompeted Ebay in China and became the de facto local E-commerce provider. Similarly, JMIA out-competed Amazon and Alibaba to be the most popular platform in Africa.    \n\n3. PLTR. The stock price will suck for a couple of months, but hear me out. Compared to its share price, the covered call premiums are juicy. I have 1000 shares and make around 300 - 700 a week from holding them. I don't mind holding for the long term because of the enormous upside. Most of PLTR's current clients are government groups like the US Military, the FBI, and the Greek Government, but they plan to increasingly expand their services to private companies under the \"Foundry\" Platform, which is projected to have a market size of $56B. According to the PLTR website, Foundry will serve \"approximately 6,000 companies with more than $500-million in annual revenue\". It's no wonder CEO Alex Karp said investors will be \"pleasantly surprised.\" It might dip below 20 near-term, but hold for the long-term tendies. \n\nAgain, the above three stocks will likely suffer from the GA Senate runoff election's volatility, but these are opportunities to load up on more shares and/or buy leaps. We're still in a Fed-fueled secular bull market. A republican senate would be favorable for stocks, but I think NIO and PLTR in particular will have an overall favorable increase under a blue wave, while JMIA is just too similar to Alibaba to ignore right now. They are one earnings-beat away from mooning. \n\nWas bored and made a short vid based on these positions:   \n[https://youtu.be/9ZsIGhddNow](https://youtu.be/9ZsIGhddNow)\n\n  \nAs always, do you own DD, and Happy 2021!   \n\n\nLet's make tendies.", "author_fullname": "t2_h6hq3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Great Leap Ideas for 2021 - BTFD", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kqjmbn", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 30, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 30, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\u001b201007:33:1"}], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609827867.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Stocks broadly dipped today (Jan 4), and tomorrow, the positions will likely dip further because of uncertainty over the GA runoff elections.
