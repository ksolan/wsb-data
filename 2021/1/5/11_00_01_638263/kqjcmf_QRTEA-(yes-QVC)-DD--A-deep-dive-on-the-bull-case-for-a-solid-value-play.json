{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Sit down and listen up ladies and gentlecucks, I have some fresh-off-the-griddle DD for you.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about QRTEA aka Qurate Retail Group aka QVC aka QxH. I\u2019ve noticed nobody on here is really talking about this company but it\u2019s in a very interesting position and is way undervalued.\n\nLet\u2019s get this out of the way:\n\n\u201cYou mean the fucking company that sells shit to my boomer parents on TV?\u201d\n\nYeah, *that* fucking company.\n\n[OMFG it\u2019s not a Robinhood chart](https://preview.redd.it/xc2dg3n35e961.png?width=1268&format=png&auto=webp&s=750d9e9a7a59ceeed81d49fd772e3887fe1ecbef)\n\n[Direct image link](https://p-xbfzzva.t3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/X6u0XKGp/90789e25-a889-40d5-bec9-3e8811fb2db3.jpg?source=viewer&v=656392fc3f711037dfeaa521ffa34f9a)\n\nReal quick, let\u2019s first take a look at WTF I\u2019m talking about. You see that sad, sad 5 year chart above? Great.\n\n**1. QVC:** ***that*** **boomer fuck of a company? And WTF is a Qurate?**\n\nOkay so I can\u2019t answer that second question. Is it supposed to be a play on \u2018curate\u2019? I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s fucking awful\u2014but irrelevant. Moving on.\n\nOver the past 5 years QVC has gone down the shitter. Which, well, duh\u2014who the fuck besides your granny is buying stuff from a TV channel? The price bottomed out around $3 earlier this year. Oof.\n\nBut through a series of buyouts, mergers, and restructures between 2018 and today, they\u2019ve strategically and, frankly, very quietly put themselves in a **great** position to make a significant turnaround. I\u2019m not the only one who thinks so\u2014you\u2019ll see why below.\n\nFirst and foremost, here\u2019s the deal: their market cap is currently only $4.9B, which makes no sense against their revenues, which were roughly $13.5B in 2019. **That\u2019s a P/S ratio of only \\~0.35** aka THEIR MARKET CAP IS ONLY A THIRD OF THEIR REVENUES. The fuck.\n\n[lol charts](https://preview.redd.it/mynaofv45e961.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c633025c0f000d9f6c0a9fff95098b3a7305490)\n\n[Direct image link](https://p-xbfzzva.t3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/X6u0XKGp/90789e25-a889-40d5-bec9-3e8811fb2db3.jpg?source=viewer&v=656392fc3f711037dfeaa521ffa34f9a)\n\nIn 2018 they increased their revenues dramatically YoY. But you\u2019re probably thinking **so fucking what? I have eyes and can see in 2019 they had a shit year** and did the opposite of grow. Well\u2026\n\n**2. OMNICHANNEL. No but, actually, ecommerce.**\n\nSo first and foremost: In 2018, **ecommerce revenue became 58% of their annual revenues \\[1\\].** So they\u2019re no longer just \u201cthat tv channel your senile grandma buys from\u201d. **They\u2019re a through-and-through ecomm company now.**\n\nTo go further, they actually own several ecommerce brands including Zulily. Y\u2019all\u2019ve likely seen ads for Zulily but I\u2019m sure most of you have no idea what they sell. That\u2019s because the target demo isn\u2019t you, it\u2019s mothers with young children, aka woman between the ages of 20 and 40. My guess is that that represents a few of you but the vast majority of you are basement-dwelling manchildren that would never use Zulily. I certainly don\u2019t. But it doesn\u2019t really matter **what** they sell\u2026\n\nMy point is that in 2018 they grew their customer base by 24% \\[2\\] and in 2019 they released a stat noting that they have **91% customer return rate \\[3\\]** which is insanely high with that growth. Their customers are dedicated af and their customer base is growing rapidly.\n\nWhat sort of P/S ratios do ecomm companies have in 2020? Well, let\u2019s look at the \u201cconservative\u201d case, Overstock:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jiesgqa65e961.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=98f4c46af4728b51cb86e2e2d64949f8c857b1eb\n\n[Direct image link](https://p-xbfzzva.t3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/geuoBEQy/e116af9c-30b7-41b1-a463-81792d717fc2.jpg?source=viewer&v=80c6b95b71c588de8acecf90f891e6c1)\n\nOver 2x higher than Qurate.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s just one company. What about others?\u201d\n\n[thanks ycharts](https://preview.redd.it/60obqo275e961.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb073198e793423bd2693b8b1fb8323c7c362c60)\n\n[Direct image link](https://p-xbfzzva.t3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/YEuQJeEz/5739116e-4e2c-4a01-b111-5efd309ea4bd.jpg?source=viewer&v=a183acd45d10baa142544e4f3b233b57)\n\nConvinced yet? No? Fucking fine, let\u2019s keep going.\n\n**3. Ferrari? No, Ferraro. (And maybe a Ferrari)**\n\nTheir shitty 2019 revenues were likely due to a massive restructuring where they finally merged HSN and QVC at the end of 2018 \\[4\\]. No surprise there, restructuring two behemoth old fucks is a big job. Money was invested. Revenues slid.\n\n**But then at the end of 2019, they hired Leslie Ferraro \\[5\\].** Who the fuck is Ferraro? Oh, only the previous president of Disney\u2019s Consumer Products division during one of their highest growth periods \\[6\\] and someone who was at the company for 17 years before leaving in 2016. This is a woman who has options, she\u2019s not going to join a sinking ship after taking 3 years to make a decision about what company to join.\n\nSo she joined in September 2019, just before we kicked off our current pandemic, as president of newly-combined QxH, which is the combination of QVC and HSN (oh look, they have no real competitors in this space now). With her experience in marketing, licensing, and interactive media, she\u2019ll likely be able to grow the digital and ecomm side of this business beyond its life as fading boomer TV telesales networks.\n\nEven so, their revenues were still surprisingly significant which brings me to 2020\u2026\n\n**4. COVID-19**\n\nWhen COVID-19 happened and we all got trapped inside and forgot what it was like to interact with other humans, like when you used to leave your basement to say hi to your wife and her boyfriend upstairs. This means your boomer parents and granny have been doing nothing but watching fucking TV and browsing the internet at 300% zoom. I don\u2019t think I need to tell you why that\u2019s good for QRTEA but just in case you\u2019re too smooth-brained to understand: it means they\u2019ve done incredibly well this year compared to 2019 and will likely outdo their 2018 revenues.\n\nJust take a look at their last 10-Q filing: [https://ir.qurateretail.com/node/32576/html#BalanceSheets\\_260982](https://ir.qurateretail.com/node/32576/html#BalanceSheets_260982) (big numbers, many words. TL;DR, numbers go from negative in 2019 to positive in 2020)\n\n**5. Michael-fucking-Burry**\n\nIn addition to all of this, there\u2019s my favorite kicker: sometime between June and September, Michael Always-A-Bit-Too-Early-But-Not-Wrong Burry bought **1.1 million shares** of QRTEA \\[7\\]. Since then the price has just bounced around a bunch and is still flat, but that doesn\u2019t mean squat. This is a man with a plan and a fuckton of shares.\n\n**6. The Dividends**\n\nOn November 20th, Qurate released an announcement that they\u2019ll be doing a $1.50 per share special dividend, and a share buyback \\[8\\]. Presumably, this means they\u2019ve been having a spectacular Q4, on top of a great three quarters leading up to that, and they have the cash to not only give a dividend but buy back shares.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fbandwh85e961.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=b48e4a8beb54cce18c18a682077d057c1bd3efb2\n\nThe day they made that announcement, the price jumped from $8.83 to $11.59 by the 25th. It settled in the $10 range after that.\n\n**7. Lastly, Melvin Capital, those dumb fucks, and the battle of shorts**\n\nI swear, it\u2019s like they exclusively just inverse Burry\u2019s positions. Or Burry inverses their positions? IDGAF. The point is\u2026\n\nMelvin Capital is holding $31M of puts \\[9\\] on QRTEA. They created this position in Q2 of this year \\[10\\] when the stock was between $5-7, so I assume they expected Qurate to go bankrupt (lol) and have put themselves in a really shitty position. They actually unraveled about $11M worth of puts in Q3, so that $31M position is down from $42M, I guess realizing they were immediately underwater and, perhaps, becoming aware of Burry\u2019s investment.\n\nAs we all know, these folks will do anything to keep the price down. They\u2019re already underwater and I\u2019ve noticed the past couple weeks there has been a whale putting up a huge sell wall to keep the price below $11.30. Keep playing those games, friends. How\u2019s it working out for you on GME?\n\n**8. Conclusion**\n\nSo where does this leave us? We have a company that has a wildly undervalued market cap compared to revenues, has restructured itself into a real ecomm company, has brought on an expert at growth in the interactive and licensing space, has growing revenue during a pandemic and was perfectly positioned to take advantage of it and feed growth, and is doing so well it issued a special dividend and set up a buyback program. Michal MF Burry has bought in, and Melvin Capital is shorting it\u2014which if GME is anything to go by, is a good sign.\n\n**TL;DR: QRTEA is no longer a boomer company and the market hasn\u2019t realized it yet so it\u2019s still undervalued. Q4 holiday earnings are in February \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\n**Position: 2300 shares, 500 $18.5c 4/16**\n\n**References for you skeptics:**\n\n\\[1\\]

fresh-off-the-griddle DD for you.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s talk about QRTEA aka Qurate Retail Group aka QVC aka QxH. I\u2019ve noticed nobody on here is really talking about this company but it\u2019s in a very interesting position and is way undervalued.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s get this out of the way:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou mean the fucking company that sells shit to my boomer parents on TV?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, <em>that</em> fucking company.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xc2dg3n35e961.png?width=1268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=750d9e9a7a59ceeed81d49fd772e3887fe1ecbef\">OMFG it\u2019s not a Robinhood chart</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://p-xbfzzva.t3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/X6u0XKGp/90789e25-a889-40d5-bec9-3e8811fb2db3.jpg?source=viewer&amp;v=656392fc3f711037dfeaa521ffa34f9a\">Direct image link</a></p>\n\n<p>Real quick, let\u2019s first take a look at WTF I\u2019m talking about. You see that sad, sad 5 year chart above? Great.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. QVC:</strong> <strong><em>that</em></strong> <strong>boomer fuck of a company? And WTF is a Qurate?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Okay so I can\u2019t answer that second question. Is it supposed to be a play on \u2018curate\u2019? I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s fucking awful\u2014but irrelevant. Moving on.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past 5 years QVC has gone down the shitter. Which, well, duh\u2014who the fuck besides your granny is buying stuff from a TV channel? The price bottomed out around $3 earlier this year. Oof.</p>\n\n<p>But through a series of buyouts, mergers, and restructures between 2018 and today, they\u2019ve strategically and, frankly, very quietly put themselves in a <strong>great</strong> position to make a significant turnaround. I\u2019m not the only one who thinks so\u2014you\u2019ll see why below.</p>\n\n<p>First and foremost, here\u2019s the deal: their market cap is currently only $4.9B, which makes no sense against their revenues, which were roughly $13.5B in 2019. <strong>That\u2019s a P/S ratio of only ~0.35</strong> aka THEIR MARKET CAP IS ONLY A THIRD OF THEIR REVENUES. The fuck.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mynaofv45e961.png?width=1300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c633025c0f000d9f6c0a9fff95098b3a7305490\">lol charts</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://p-xbfzzva.t3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/X6u0XKGp/90789e25-a889-40d5-bec9-3e8811fb2db3.jpg?source=viewer&amp;v=656392fc3f711037dfeaa521ffa34f9a\">Direct image link</a></p>\n\n<p>In 2018 they increased their revenues dramatically YoY. But you\u2019re probably thinking <strong>so fucking what? I have eyes and can see in 2019 they had a shit year</strong> and did the opposite of grow. Well\u2026</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. OMNICHANNEL. No but, actually, ecommerce.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So first and foremost: In 2018, <strong>ecommerce revenue became 58% of their annual revenues [1].</strong> So they\u2019re no longer just \u201cthat tv channel your senile grandma buys from\u201d. <strong>They\u2019re a through-and-through ecomm company now.</strong></p>\n\n<p>To go further, they actually own several ecommerce brands including Zulily. Y\u2019all\u2019ve likely seen ads for Zulily but I\u2019m sure most of you have no idea what they sell. That\u2019s because the target demo isn\u2019t you, it\u2019s mothers with young children, aka woman between the ages of 20 and 40. My guess is that that represents a few of you but the vast majority of you are basement-dwelling manchildren that would never use Zulily. I certainly don\u2019t. But it doesn\u2019t really matter <strong>what</strong> they sell\u2026</p>\n\n<p>My point is that in 2018 they grew their customer base by 24% [2] and in 2019 they released a stat noting that they have <strong>91% customer return rate [3]</strong> which is insanely high with that growth. Their customers are dedicated af and their customer base is growing rapidly.</p>\n\n<p>What sort of P/S ratios do ecomm companies have in 2020? Well, let\u2019s look at the \u201cconservative\u201d case, Overstock:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jiesgqa65e961.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98f4c46af4728b51cb86e2e2d64949f8c857b1eb\">https://preview.redd.it/jiesgqa65e961.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98f4c46af4728b51cb86e2e2d64949f8c857b1eb</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://p-xbfzzva.t3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/geuoBEQy/e116af9c-30b7-41b1-a463-81792d717fc2.jpg?source=viewer&amp;v=80c6b95b71c588de8acecf90f891e6c1\">Direct image link</a></p>\n\n<p>Over 2x higher than Qurate.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBut that\u2019s just one company. What about others?\u201d</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/60obqo275e961.png?width=1046&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb073198e793423bd2693b8b1fb8323c7c362c60\">thanks ycharts</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://p-xbfzzva.t3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/YEuQJeEz/5739116e-4e2c-4a01-b111-5efd309ea4bd.jpg?source=viewer&amp;v=a183acd45d10baa142544e4f3b233b57\">Direct image link</a></p>\n\n<p>Convinced yet? No? Fucking fine, let\u2019s keep going.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Ferrari? No, Ferraro. (And maybe a Ferrari)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Their shitty 2019 revenues were likely due to a massive restructuring where they finally merged HSN and QVC at the end of 2018 [4]. No surprise there, restructuring two behemoth old fucks is a big job. Money was invested. Revenues slid.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But then at the end of 2019, they hired Leslie Ferraro [5].</strong> Who the fuck is Ferraro? Oh, only the previous president of Disney\u2019s Consumer Products division during one of their highest growth periods [6] and someone who was at the company for 17 years before leaving in 2016. This is a woman who has options, she\u2019s not going to join a sinking ship after taking 3 years to make a decision about what company to join.</p>\n\n<p>So she joined in September 2019, just before we kicked off our current pandemic, as president of newly-combined QxH, which is the combination of QVC and HSN (oh look, they have no real competitors in this space now). With her experience in marketing, licensing, and interactive media, she\u2019ll likely be able to grow the digital and ecomm side of this business beyond its life as fading boomer TV telesales networks.</p>\n\n<p>Even so, their revenues were still surprisingly significant which brings me to 2020\u2026</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. COVID-19</strong></p>\n\n<p>When COVID-19 happened and we all got trapped inside and forgot what it was like to interact with other humans, like when you used to leave your basement to say hi to your wife and her boyfriend upstairs. This means your boomer parents and granny have been doing nothing but watching fucking TV and browsing the internet at 300% zoom. I don\u2019t think I need to tell you why that\u2019s good for QRTEA but just in case you\u2019re too smooth-brained to understand: it means they\u2019ve done incredibly well this year compared to 2019 and will likely outdo their 2018 revenues.</p>\n\n<p>Just take a look at their last 10-Q filing: <a href=\"https://ir.qurateretail.com/node/32576/html#BalanceSheets_260982\">https://ir.qurateretail.com/node/32576/html#BalanceSheets_260982</a> (big numbers, many words. TL;DR, numbers go from negative in 2019 to positive in 2020)</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Michael-fucking-Burry</strong></p>\n\n<p>In addition to all of this, there\u2019s my favorite kicker: sometime between June and September, Michael Always-A-Bit-Too-Early-But-Not-Wrong Burry bought <strong>1.1 million shares</strong> of QRTEA [7]. Since then the price has just bounced around a bunch and is still flat, but that doesn\u2019t mean squat. This is a man with a plan and a fuckton of shares.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. The Dividends</strong></p>\n\n<p>On November 20th, Qurate released an announcement that they\u2019ll be doing a $1.50 per share special dividend, and a share buyback [8]. Presumably, this means they\u2019ve been having a spectacular Q4, on top of a great three quarters leading up to that, and they have the cash to not only give a dividend but buy back shares.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fbandwh85e961.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b48e4a8beb54cce18c18a682077d057c1bd3efb2\">https://preview.redd.it/fbandwh85e961.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b48e4a8beb54cce18c18a682077d057c1bd3efb2</a></p>\n\n<p>The day they made that announcement, the price jumped from $8.83 to $11.59 by the 25th. It settled in the $10 range after that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Lastly, Melvin Capital, those dumb fucks, and the battle of shorts</strong></p>\n\n<p>I swear, it\u2019s like they exclusively just inverse Burry\u2019s positions. Or Burry inverses their positions? IDGAF. The point is\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Melvin Capital is holding $31M of puts [9] on QRTEA. They created this position in Q2 of this year [10] when the stock was between $5-7, so I assume they expected Qurate to go bankrupt (lol) and have put themselves in a really shitty position. They actually unraveled about $11M worth of puts in Q3, so that $31M position is down from $42M, I guess realizing they were immediately underwater and, perhaps, becoming aware of Burry\u2019s investment.</p>\n\n<p>As we all know, these folks will do anything to keep the price down. They\u2019re already underwater and I\u2019ve noticed the past couple weeks there has been a whale putting up a huge sell wall to keep the price below $11.30. Keep playing those games, friends. How\u2019s it working out for you on GME?</p>\n\n<p><strong>8. Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>So where does this leave us? We have a company that has a wildly undervalued market cap compared to revenues, has restructured itself into a real ecomm company, has brought on an expert at growth in the interactive and licensing space, has growing revenue during a pandemic and was perfectly positioned to take advantage of it and feed growth, and is doing so well it issued a special dividend and set up a buyback program. Michal MF Burry has bought in, and Melvin Capital is shorting it\u2014which if GME is anything to go by, is a good sign.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: QRTEA is no longer a boomer company and the market hasn\u2019t realized it yet so it\u2019s still undervalued. Q4 holiday earnings are in February \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Position: 2300 shares, 500 $18.5c 4/16</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>References
