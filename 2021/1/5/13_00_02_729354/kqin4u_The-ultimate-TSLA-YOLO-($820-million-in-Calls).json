Or an extremely-retarded way to place a Bullish bet on a company.**\n\nIf you want to learn why, read this long winded explanation.\n\nIt's a little hard to explain cause it is an advanced option strategy. It is called a diagonal call debit spread. I'll do my best. So these positions went through at the same time, which is how we know it is a diagonal spread and not 2 different orders. Now the order of events will go as follows.\n\n* They sold the 700c expiring in September 2021, and pocketed $410,496,500\n* At that money was used to purchase the 800c expiring Jan 2022, for a cost of $410,718,390\n* So over all they paid  $221,890. They are at risk of losing a max of $225,329,295, and stand to gain a max of  $180,640,649\n* So because the 700c they sold expires first, they are betting the stock stays below $700, so it expires worthless, and they get to keep the 410 Million they sold it for. Of course all of this was spent to buy the 800c.\n* Since the 800c they bought expires in Jan, it still has value, although has decayed a lot, and they can still sell it and recoup the cash, and it is all profit.\n\nNow the reason they would do this as opposed to just buying puts or a normal put spread, is it gives them more flexibility as to how to close out the position. Look at these two images, and I will explain how it is all working.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/PMf0TaK](https://imgur.com/a/PMf0TaK)\n\nIn the first image you can see how the profit increase over time for everything below $700, reaching max profit just below 700, because the first option expires worthless, and the second options is as close to 800 as it can get without putting the 700 ITM.\n\nYou can also see that it gives a it of flexibility to exit the position for a small profit, if it moves up against you over 700, but will drop off quickly as the expiration approaches, cause you will be on the hook for those calls you sold.\n\nIn the second image you can see what happens to your 800c After the 700c has expired. The 800c has already lost 50-60%, if it is sitting around $700, and Theta quickly east away at whats left. Now technically you could diamond hands the 800c, making the entire play be a short term bearish, but long term bullish, but it would have to reverse and move up quickly to be near or beat the max profit when closing out in September, so it is unlikely to be played this way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit. In fairness, there is a chance they are rolling the options out. Or this is a very funky inverse of what I described.

They are at risk of losing a max of $225,329,295, and stand to gain a max of  $180,640,649</li>\n<li>So because the 700c they sold expires first, they are betting the stock stays below $700, so it expires worthless, and they get to keep the 410 Million they sold it for. Of course all of this was spent to buy the 800c.</li>\n<li>Since the 800c they bought expires in Jan, it still has value, although has decayed a lot, and they can still sell it and recoup the cash, and it is all profit.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now the reason they would do this as opposed to just buying puts or a normal put spread, is it gives them more flexibility as to how to close out the position. Look at these two images, and I will explain how it is all working.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/PMf0TaK\">https://imgur.com/a/PMf0TaK</a></p>\n\n<p>In the first image you can see how the profit increase over time for everything below $700, reaching max profit just below 700, because the first option expires worthless, and the second options is as close to 800 as it can get without putting the 700 ITM.</p>\n\n<p>You can also see that it gives a it of flexibility to exit the position for a small profit, if it moves up against you over 700, but will drop off quickly as the expiration approaches, cause you will be on the hook for those calls you sold.</p>\n\n<p>In the second image you can see what happens to your 800c After the 700c has expired. The 800c has already lost 50-60%, if it is sitting around $700, and Theta quickly east away at whats left. Now technically you could diamond hands the 800c, making the entire play be a short term bearish, but long term bullish, but it would have to reverse and move up quickly to be near or beat the max profit when closing out in September, so it is unlikely to be played this way.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Edit. In fairness, there is a chance they are rolling the options out. Or this is a very funky inverse of what I described. Both of these are far less likely in my opinion.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqin4u/the_ultimate_tsla_yolo_820_million_in_calls/gi5ge86/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_gi5ge86", "created": 1609852381.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1609823581.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "replies": [{"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_kqin4u", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gi5l6ia", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": {"name": "pstapper", "fullname": "t2_5qpg5ix"}, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gi5ge86", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5qpg5ix", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "collapsed": false, "body": "Thank you for the in depth explanation.
