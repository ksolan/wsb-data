{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I am not put off by today's stock price drop as the fundamentals of Romeo have improved compared to yesterday and the cheaper stock is a good buying opportunity for anyone who wants to get in below $20 per share. DD below. \n\nToday's price drop was driven by a conflation of macro economic factors unrelated to Romeo, namely: \n\n\n1. There was a broad market sell off today. 80% of S&P 500 companies lost value. This was due to more restrictive COVID restrictions in North America and Europe. \n\n\n2. On negative market news (above), investors take their money out of riskier stocks first, less risky stocks last. Romeo is a riskier stock because its a relatively new company (founded in 2016) and a small company (less than $1bn market cap), so naturally more investors will flee Romeo versus say, Apple or Tesla. \n\n\n3. The EV sector (and SPACs generally) exploded in q4 2020. It's natural for air to come out of a balloon that's been inflated so dramatically and rapidly as investors will be taking their profits. \n\n\n4. A report came out today casting doubt on the promise of QuantumScape's solid state technology. This caused QS stock to drop dramatically. Since QS is the poster child of the EV/SPAC bubble, short term investors get scared off of the sector as a whole and flee other EV stocks (not just QS). \n\n\n5. The conflation of factors above results in significant selling pressure, causing the stock price to dip significantly. After this initial (2%) price fall, day traders who are overleveraged face margin calls and are forced to sell. This causes the price to drop even more dramatically. This price drop - margin call pattern is a self reinforcing cycle which results in a large price drop on the day.\n\nDespite the above, I am confident Romeo Power is currently undervalued at $20 per share, because:\n\n6. Romeo is one of the only EV sector players with a product - and it even has revenue already. Prior to today the company had over $500 million in committed revenue (2021 to 2025). \n\n7. Today Romeo signed a supply contract with Heritage Power, which is additional committed revenue on top of the $500 million.\n\n8. On 31 December 2020, Lion Electric disclosed that Amazon agreed to purchase from Lion Electric up to 2,500 electric busses. Romeo is the battery supplier for Lion Electric, so this Amazon deal de-risks the committed revenue Romeo has from Lion Electric. Lion Electric has also found a SPAC partner which will provide the necessary funding to manufacture the busses.\n\n9. Even better, Amazon's contract with Lion Electric includes an option for Amazon to purchase up to a 20 per cent stake in Lion Power. If Amazon exercises this option, Lion Electric will be a force to be reckoned with in the electric Class 8 commercial vehicle market - in which Romeo is the market leader - which bodes incredibly well for Romeo long term.\n\nTherefore, I am not put off by today's stock price drop as the fundamentals of Romeo have improved compared to yesterday and the cheaper stock is a good buying opportunity for anyone who wants to get in below $20 per share. BTIG analysts have set a price target of $40 for Romeo (not factoring in the latest positive developments set out above).\n\nSource: I'm a Corporate Lawyer by profession and I subscribe to the Wall Street Journal, Financial Times and other publications.", "author_fullname": "t2_4gxr1xil", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Romeo Power - January 4 2021 stock analysis", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kqmzgu", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 34, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 34, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1609827917.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609838028.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am not put off by today&#39;s stock price drop as the fundamentals of Romeo have improved compared to yesterday and the cheaper stock is a good buying opportunity for anyone who wants to get in below $20 per share.
