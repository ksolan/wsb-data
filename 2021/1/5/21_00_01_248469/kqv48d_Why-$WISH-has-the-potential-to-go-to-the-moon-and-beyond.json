{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "This post is in no way financial advice. I\u2019m no expert, I\u2019m just here to explain why I have yolo\u2019d my account into Wish.com shares and calls. I encourage everyone to do their own due diligence. \n\nPart 1: The Basics\n\nWish.com went public on December 16th and nosedived from $23 to $17.45 over the course of about 2 weeks. Wish has rallied over the past two trading days despite the market being red overall. I think the stock is way oversold and potentially hit its bottom last Thursday. Let me spit some quick facts about the company:\n\n- Amazon and Alibaba both offered $10 billion to acquire Wish in 2015. This is obviously prior to the boom e-commerce has received from Covid. Wish\u2019s annual revenue was $300 million at this point. \n- Revenue in 2019 was $2.3 billion, about $800 million more than Shopify in 2019 for reference. \n- Founded by former Google and Yahoo programmers and recently appointed a former Square exec to their board of directors\n- Wish had over 90 million monthly users in 2019, and I believe that number has gone up considerably by now. \n- Most downloaded shopping app of all time with over 500 million downloads.\n- Serves over 100 countries with 3 million transactions a day.\n- No debt and over 1-2 billion in cash\n- In spite of further lockdown news today, Wish went up. I believe this stock is now being recognized as a stay-at-home stock, yet should perform well post-covid due to the longevity of the e-commerce industry as a whole. \n- Although Wish is an American company, many of its merchants are Chinese. I believe Wish might gain in the short term in response to uncertainty over Alibaba\u2019s monopoly investigation. \n- If none of the above has gotten your cock hard yet, Palantir Co-Founder, John Lonsdale, owns 59 million shares of Wish.   \n\nPart 2: Data\n\nData is the new oil bitches. Wish has an absolute fuckton of users, and what sticks out to me is that the majority of purchases made on wish are items that weren\u2019t searched for by the buyer.  These are items recommended by Wish\u2019s algorithm. Only about 15%-20% of purchases made on wish are made through the buyer performing a search. Wish is very effectively using the data they collect to recommend the right products to the right people. If you don\u2019t see the value in that, then fuck you.\n\nAnd may I remind you that John Lonsdale, Data God and Palantir Co-Founder, owns 59 million shares of Wish. \n\nPart 3: The Cons\n\nThe biggest criticisms I\u2019ve seen of Wish is that the product quality can be poor and the shipping time can be poor. These are valid points, however I believe the leadership of this company will make strides in improving upon those two problems, especially when you consider that they just raised a billion dollars in their IPO. Additionally, I\u2019ve seen positive reviews regarding their refund policy. This obviously does not excuse poor product quality and shopping time, but the numbers don\u2019t lie. People are buying shit on Wish. There is a market for cheap, low quality shit and Wish is capitalizing on it hard. If you think Wish is a garbage company, just remember that amazon and alibaba both saw massive value prior to all the growth Wish has had in the last 5 years. \n\nOnce the quiet period is over and Wish releases its first earnings report since they\u2019ve gone public, I\u2019m anticipating a huge run. \n\nPositions: Loaded to the fucking gills with shares and some July 16 $25 calls.

I stopped ordering because of it. I went from using it daily to not at all. I used to order hundreds of packages for crafts - all small items. I made one big order last year two of a heavy item and it didn\u2019t arrive either so it\u2019s not a case of not caring about the smaller items. I don\u2019t see people having faith in it until this is over. And people that only started shopping this year will probably never go back because it\u2019s their only experience</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqv48d/why_wish_has_the_potential_to_go_to_the_moon_and/gi60f01/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_gi60f01", "created": 1609869868.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1609841068.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "replies": [{"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 13, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_kqv48d", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gi67qba", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "author": {"name": "Lonevets", "fullname": "t2_6ahtwmai"}, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gi60f01", "score": 13, "author_fullname": "t2_6ahtwmai", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "collapsed": false, "body": "I heard there was a pandemic last year affecting all industries like shipping and manufacturing...could be a rumor.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\u001b201207:1:1"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I heard there was a pandemic last year affecting all industries like shipping and manufacturing...could be a rumor.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqv48d/why_wish_has_the_potential_to_go_to_the_moon_and/gi67qba/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_gi67qba", "created": 1609877057.0, "author_flair_text": "\u001b201207:1:1", "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1609848257.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "replies": [{"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 0, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_kqv48d", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gi67zgp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "author": {"name": "carolbaskinsfellit", "fullname": "t2_74yccsd0"}, "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1609848486.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gi67qba", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_74yccsd0", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "body": "The packages are so light I think they all went onto passenger planes and for fuck all and now all that\u2019s closed down.
