Look, the point is, UnderArmour spent all of 2020 wrestling with its demons and is ready to get its shit together in 2021.\n\nRemember those days? From 2012 to 2016, UnderArmour had the fitness apparel industry by the nuts. Then Nike, Adidas, and the high school sweetheart with the great ass, Lululemon, all went on to bigger and better things while UnderArmour flamed out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1von23nnkj961.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=92fa8df00a847876561ca76546689314c9d11959\n\nI'll talk in this post about what went wrong and what's now going right.\n\n# UnderArmour was an incredible growth story -- what the fuck happened?\n\nThe TL;DR for this section is they stopped growing as quickly, lied about it to investors, got a bunch of negative press, and tried to make up for it by overspending on stupid stuff.\n\n1. Misleading investors\n\nThe company was proud of its streak of 26 consecutive quarters of 20% YOY growth. So when this trend came to an end, they\u2026kept it going anyway? [Yeah, they cooked their books to make it look like growth wasn\u2019t slowing down, moving revenues from quarter to quarter, and failing to disclose the practice.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/under-armour-is-subject-of-federal-accounting-probe-11572819835)They went through 3 CFO\u2019s from 2016 to 2017 and they ended up getting sued by investors who lost money on the stock. Ultimately this little fiasco cost founder and then-CEO Kevin Plank his job, though he remains in place as Chairman of the Board today.\n\nThe lawsuits remain ongoing.\n\n2. Design issues with their shoes\n\nUnderArmour signed Steph Curry, at the time the biggest star in the NBA, to be the brand ambassador that Michael Jordan was for Nike. The problem was, Curry didn\u2019t even like the product, wouldn\u2019t wear the shoes on the court, and threatened to walk away from the deal at multiple different points. The Curry 2\u2019s, which were supposed to be UA\u2019s Air Jordans, [looked like grandpa\u2019s walking shoes](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/steph-curry-under-armour-white-nba-sneakers-internet-memes-jokes/).\n\nWhen these shoes shockingly failed to sell, Kevin Plank blamed a bad market. Y\u2019all remember when we randomly just stopped buying and wearing shoes in 2016?\n\n3. Ridiculous endorsement deals\n\nCollege athletic apparel endorsement deals are kind of a big deal in this industry. The University of Oregon\u2019s biggest athletic booster is the CEO of Nike, Phil Knight, and Oregon is well known for its always-changing uniforms. Kevin Plank, as a former football player at the University of Maryland, has created a similar dynamic at his alma mater. But the competition for endorsement deals between Nike, Adidas, and UnderArmour jumped the shark over the past decade. [Here\u2019s a list](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielkleinman/2019/09/13/ucla-most-valuable-college-apparel-deals/?sh=8b2220967624) from 2019.\n\nAnd a quote: Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank has expressed the need to be strategic with which universities his company works with. \u201cWe have big competitors who are good at what they do,\u201d Plank told the *Portland Business Journal* [earlier this year](https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2019/04/05/exclusiveunder-armour-ceo-kevin-plank-talks-final.html). \u201cWe\u2019re big enough that we can do any one of these deals, but we can\u2019t do them all.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a $280,000,000 agreement to put their logo on UCLA uniforms from 2017-2032. This is where we jumped the shark. A little more on this later.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious, the full list of Under Armour's endorsement deals is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Under_Armour_sponsorships).\n\n4. UnderArmour \u2013 tech company? WTF?\n\nUnderArmour spent a bunch of money on MyFitnessPal and MapMyFitness. The brand has been built around the idea that the clothes are performance enhancing technology\u2026 which I guess I can understand. But there\u2019s a difference between fabric technology and electronics. Look, I use the MapMyFitness app, it\u2019s actually pretty cool, but it was a distraction for a textile manufacturer. They\u2019re not a tech company built to lose money, they were a profitable company that tried its hand at app development. Bad idea.\n\nI do believe, personally, that wearable tech will become commonplace and define the consumer space over the next decade alongside 5G and the Internet of Things, and I would expect UnderArmour will jump back into that arena when it's time.  Hopefully the lesson they've learned is that it needs to be streamlined in their primary business model of making clothes.\n\n**Just focus on what you\u2019re good at.**\n\nBefore I get into how they\u2019re fixing things, let\u2019s take a look at the same group of comps as in the table above, in terms of % growth over the past 6 months. Whatever they\u2019re doing, it\u2019s working. They\u2019re quietly getting back to outpacing the competition.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bgce4nzskj961.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d70cc527148727e48b3a084c434c3de28f1d21d\n\nAs I said up at the top, UnderArmour has spent 2020 walking back so many mistakes from the past few years. I think they\u2019ll go back to just selling their clothes, and stop doing other shit! See below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Here\u2019s what UnderArmour has done in 2020 to stop hemorrhaging money:\n\n* **Restructing Plan announced 3/31/2020**\n\nFrom page 12-13 of the[3Q20 10-Q](https://underarmourinc.gcs-web.com/static-files/7683a1cc-d5bd-49ee-a634-59f9bbc687e7) :\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zgqcx5mwkj961.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=2852aaa0d3c588680388b3c7287f4ba02723d13f\n\nAs of 9/30, the company had realized approximately $410MM in restructuring costs out of an estimated $550-$600MM. **The remainder of the restructuring costs were completed in 4Q 2020 \u2013 remember this when they report earnings in early February.** I believe that, once the company announces completion of the restructuring plan, and provide guidance for 2021, that investors should react favorably even despite what will likely be a poor bottom line figure for FY2020.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A big piece of the restructuring cost is penalties from backing out of endorsement deals, most notably the $280 million deal with UCLA, the largest in history.**\n* **Sale of Under Armour Connected Fitness (My Fitness Pal, Map My Run, etc.), completed December 18 for $345 million.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pf1kjq6zkj961.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=28c5ca1c74877d39419f4f2e7f3bae49b1e7d61d\n\n* **Shut down their flagship B&M location**\n\nUnderArmour had opened its \u201cflagship\u201d storefront in New York, which was a money loser for the company. They backed out of the lease this summer and took an impairment hit on the books for over $200 million non-cash loss.\n\n* **Completed the purchase of its primary distribution channel in SE Asia in a cash transaction.**\n\n# Project Rock\n\nUnder Armour finally might have found its answer to Nike\u2019s Air Jordan branded product line. Project Rock is the new partnership with The Rock, with a pretty badass lineup of products, in my opinion.\n\n[High-end, high-margin fitness gear](https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/c/project-rock/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rsl9js31lj961.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f5a4b435ad3b0fcdb137405676db346a7271e45\n\n**Are analysts noticing the progress?**\n\nYes. The stock has received some positive press recently due to increased price targets from analysts.  A sampling of pieces from the past few days:\n\n[Factors Likely to Keep Under Armour's (UAA) Momentum Alive in 2021 (yahoo.com)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/factors-likely-keep-under-armours-135601461.html)\n\n[Pivotal Upgrades Under Armour Due To 'Disconnect Between Reality And Sentiment' (yahoo.com)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pivotal-upgrades-under-armour-due-175158988.html)\n\n[The Pandemic Helped Under Armour.

Their revenues in Asia and the Middle East fell off a cliff due to global supply chain issues and domestic sales were down due to COVID lockdowns in the USA.  This on top of their already huge restructuring costs, so full year 2020 results will end up being pretty shitty, however I believe investors already know this.\n\nGiven the improvement in 3Q, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see a YOY increase in revenues in 4Q. Add to that the $215 million in immediately payable proceeds from the December MyFitness sale, I think we ought to see improvement on the balance sheet as well, after 3Q\u2019s increase in short term debt.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nw5m4e89lj961.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4d5d15c7a9b09715566fb92d94e9bcdd744f3f\n\nThe stock price is suppressed because of those two giant red candledicks in the middle of the graph, and the announcement of the restructuring plan in Q1. Q3 showed dramatic improvement and Q4 has the potential to blow the doors off the place. Proceeds from the MyFitness sale should offset the remainder of the restructuring costs and I believe UA had a good holiday season. (I personally bought TWO pairs of $75 sweat pants.)\n\n**Other shit:**\n\nI\u2019m not going to attempt to come up with an adjusted valuation based on comps because there\u2019s too much that makes Under Armour unique compared to Nike and Lululemon (i.e. lawsuits and restructuring), but NKE trades at 5.81x TTM Sales and LULU at 11.15X TTM Sales, while UAA is trading at only 1.61x TTM Sales. But, I would not be surprised if the share price doubled in 2021.\n\nYou might also look at the price history and earnings details from Dick's Sporting Goods, Academy Sports & Outdoors, Hibbett Sports, Sportsman's Warehouse, etc. to see how sporting goods retailers are doing in 2020. They\u2019re all doing well. Sales are way up. While a lot of that is due to large ticket items and online shopping, foot traffic has actually been fairly strong in sporting goods retailers.\n\n**Bottom line:**\n\nI am a big believer in brand equity. UnderArmour\u2019s first product line was one of necessity \u2013 Kevin Plank was an offensive lineman on the University of Maryland football team, and realized the world lacked underwear that would keep your ballsack from chafing and wouldn\u2019t bunch up in your ass crack while you\u2019re running. UnderArmour was a pioneer in the compression undergarments and base layers that became popular in sports \u2013 hence the name. For many people, the entire lineup of compression base layer shorts and shirts is still known as Under Armours, in the same way every tissue is a Kleenex.\n\nI believe this is a brand that most people still want to wear. While there has been a lot of blame thrown around by management that its presence in retailers like Kohl\u2019s and JC Penney\u2019s has watered down its \u201cpremium\u201d brand image, I think that\u2019s stupid. UnderArmour\u2019s problems are its own fault. But, the products have always been marketed well and have been high quality. I still have and wear the first UA compression shorts I ever bought back in 2004.\n\nI think Project Rock is a huge development for UnderArmour that will give them the high-end, premium branded gear that they believe they lost over the course of their growth. It\u2019s cool as shit, and I think it\u2019ll give a nice boost to revenues with a nice margin.\n\nAs I wrote above, I believe that the completion of the restructuring plan will demonstrably lead to better cash flows in the future as it will streamline the business. I think Under Armour management is desperate for some good press and will provide some kickass guidance on the February earnings call.\n\n**Is this a pump and dump?**\n\nNo, but thank you for assuming I have enough money to fill a bag.\n\n**TL;DR \u2013** Under Armour is undervalued. The company was burning cash like crazy from 2017 to 2019 which resulted in deteriorating financial strength, but in 4Q2020 they completed their restructuring plan and did a little high-end rebranding, which all should improve cash flows in the future and make boomer investors happy, which will cause our long-dated calls to print like a motherfucker.\n\nBuy LEAPS, or buy and hold shares for the next 2-3 years if you\u2019re into that kind of thing.\n\nPositions: 5x UA $20c 7/16/2021 and shares of UA, and I\u2019ll be adding more as my GME ROCKETSHIP brings me that moon money. Hopefully this heightens your confidence in me as your personal financial advisor.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tko6pekklj961.png?width=1231&format=png&auto=webp&s=c38fddaa7ac208d535c5cb7d00a597b53b8ef3da\n\nAs always, am retard, do your own research and either join me in

Look, the point is, UnderArmour spent all of 2020 wrestling with its demons and is ready to get its shit together in 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Remember those days? From 2012 to 2016, UnderArmour had the fitness apparel industry by the nuts. Then Nike, Adidas, and the high school sweetheart with the great ass, Lululemon, all went on to bigger and better things while UnderArmour flamed out.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1von23nnkj961.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92fa8df00a847876561ca76546689314c9d11959\">https://preview.redd.it/1von23nnkj961.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92fa8df00a847876561ca76546689314c9d11959</a></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll talk in this post about what went wrong and what&#39;s now going right.</p>\n\n<h1>UnderArmour was an incredible growth story -- what the fuck happened?</h1>\n\n<p>The TL;DR for this section is they stopped growing as quickly, lied about it to investors, got a bunch of negative press, and tried to make up for it by overspending on stupid stuff.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Misleading investors</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The company was proud of its streak of 26 consecutive quarters of 20% YOY growth. So when this trend came to an end, they\u2026kept it going anyway? <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/under-armour-is-subject-of-federal-accounting-probe-11572819835\">Yeah, they cooked their books to make it look like growth wasn\u2019t slowing down, moving revenues from quarter to quarter, and failing to disclose the practice.</a>They went through 3 CFO\u2019s from 2016 to 2017 and they ended up getting sued by investors who lost money on the stock. Ultimately this little fiasco cost founder and then-CEO Kevin Plank his job, though he remains in place as Chairman of the Board today.</p>\n\n<p>The lawsuits remain ongoing.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Design issues with their shoes</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>UnderArmour signed Steph Curry, at the time the biggest star in the NBA, to be the brand ambassador that Michael Jordan was for Nike. The problem was, Curry didn\u2019t even like the product, wouldn\u2019t wear the shoes on the court, and threatened to walk away from the deal at multiple different points. The Curry 2\u2019s, which were supposed to be UA\u2019s Air Jordans, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/steph-curry-under-armour-white-nba-sneakers-internet-memes-jokes/\">looked like grandpa\u2019s walking shoes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When these shoes shockingly failed to sell, Kevin Plank blamed a bad market. Y\u2019all remember when we randomly just stopped buying and wearing shoes in 2016?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ridiculous endorsement deals</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>College athletic apparel endorsement deals are kind of a big deal in this industry. The University of Oregon\u2019s biggest athletic booster is the CEO of Nike, Phil Knight, and Oregon is well known for its always-changing uniforms. Kevin Plank, as a former football player at the University of Maryland, has created a similar dynamic at his alma mater. But the competition for endorsement deals between Nike, Adidas, and UnderArmour jumped the shark over the past decade. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielkleinman/2019/09/13/ucla-most-valuable-college-apparel-deals/?sh=8b2220967624\">Here\u2019s a list</a> from 2019.</p>\n\n<p>And a quote: Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank has expressed the need to be strategic with which universities his company works with. \u201cWe have big competitors who are good at what they do,\u201d Plank told the <em>Portland Business Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2019/04/05/exclusiveunder-armour-ceo-kevin-plank-talks-final.html\">earlier this year</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re big enough that we can do any one of these deals, but we can\u2019t do them all.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s a $280,000,000 agreement to put their logo on UCLA uniforms from 2017-2032. This is where we jumped the shark. A little more on this later.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re curious, the full list of Under Armour&#39;s endorsement deals is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Under_Armour_sponsorships\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>UnderArmour \u2013 tech company? WTF?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>UnderArmour spent a bunch of money on MyFitnessPal and MapMyFitness. The brand has been built around the idea that the clothes are performance enhancing technology\u2026 which I guess I can understand. But there\u2019s a difference between fabric technology and electronics. Look, I use the MapMyFitness app, it\u2019s actually pretty cool, but it was a distraction for a textile manufacturer. They\u2019re not a tech company built to lose money, they were a profitable company that tried its hand at app development. Bad idea.</p>\n\n<p>I do believe, personally, that wearable tech will become commonplace and define the consumer space over the next decade alongside 5G and the Internet of Things, and I would expect UnderArmour will jump back into that arena when it&#39;s time.  Hopefully the lesson they&#39;ve learned is that it needs to be streamlined in their primary business model of making clothes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Just focus on what you\u2019re good at.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Before I get into how they\u2019re fixing things, let\u2019s take a look at the same group of comps as in the table above, in terms of % growth over the past 6 months. Whatever they\u2019re doing, it\u2019s working. They\u2019re quietly getting back to outpacing the competition.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bgce4nzskj961.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d70cc527148727e48b3a084c434c3de28f1d21d\">https://preview.redd.it/bgce4nzskj961.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d70cc527148727e48b3a084c434c3de28f1d21d</a></p>\n\n<p>As I said up at the top, UnderArmour has spent 2020 walking back so many mistakes from the past few years. I think they\u2019ll go back to just selling their clothes, and stop doing other shit! See below.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Here\u2019s what UnderArmour has done in 2020 to stop hemorrhaging money:</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Restructing Plan announced 3/31/2020</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From page 12-13 of the<a href=\"https://underarmourinc.gcs-web.com/static-files/7683a1cc-d5bd-49ee-a634-59f9bbc687e7\">3Q20 10-Q</a> :</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zgqcx5mwkj961.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2852aaa0d3c588680388b3c7287f4ba02723d13f\">https://preview.redd.it/zgqcx5mwkj961.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2852aaa0d3c588680388b3c7287f4ba02723d13f</a></p>\n\n<p>As of 9/30, the company had realized approximately $410MM in restructuring costs out of an estimated $550-$600MM. <strong>The remainder of the restructuring costs were completed in 4Q 2020 \u2013 remember this when they report earnings in early February.</strong> I believe that, once the company announces completion of the restructuring plan, and provide guidance for 2021, that investors should react favorably even despite what will likely be a poor bottom line figure for FY2020.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A big piece of the restructuring cost is penalties from backing out of endorsement deals, most notably the $280 million deal with UCLA, the largest in history.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Sale of Under Armour Connected Fitness (My Fitness Pal, Map My Run, etc.), completed December 18 for $345 million.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/pf1kjq6zkj961.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28c5ca1c74877d39419f4f2e7f3bae49b1e7d61d\">https://preview.redd.it/pf1kjq6zkj961.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28c5ca1c74877d39419f4f2e7f3bae49b1e7d61d</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shut down their flagship B&amp;M location</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>UnderArmour had opened its \u201cflagship\u201d storefront in New York, which was a money loser for the company. They backed out of the lease this summer and took an impairment hit on the books for over $200 million non-cash loss.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Completed the purchase of its primary distribution channel in SE Asia in a cash transaction.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Project Rock</h1>\n\n<p>Under Armour finally might have found its answer to Nike\u2019s Air Jordan branded product line. Project Rock is the new partnership with The Rock, with a pretty badass lineup of products, in my opinion.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/c/project-rock/\">High-end, high-margin fitness gear</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rsl9js31lj961.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f5a4b435ad3b0fcdb137405676db346a7271e45\">https://preview.redd.it/rsl9js31lj961.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f5a4b435ad3b0fcdb137405676db346a7271e45</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Are analysts noticing the progress?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes.

Their revenues in Asia and the Middle East fell off a cliff due to global supply chain issues and domestic sales were down due to COVID lockdowns in the USA.  This on top of their already huge restructuring costs, so full year 2020 results will end up being pretty shitty, however I believe investors already know this.</p>\n\n<p>Given the improvement in 3Q, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see a YOY increase in revenues in 4Q. Add to that the $215 million in immediately payable proceeds from the December MyFitness sale, I think we ought to see improvement on the balance sheet as well, after 3Q\u2019s increase in short term debt.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nw5m4e89lj961.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e4d5d15c7a9b09715566fb92d94e9bcdd744f3f\">https://preview.redd.it/nw5m4e89lj961.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e4d5d15c7a9b09715566fb92d94e9bcdd744f3f</a></p>\n\n<p>The stock price is suppressed because of those two giant red candledicks in the middle of the graph, and the announcement of the restructuring plan in Q1. Q3 showed dramatic improvement and Q4 has the potential to blow the doors off the place. Proceeds from the MyFitness sale should offset the remainder of the restructuring costs and I believe UA had a good holiday season. (I personally bought TWO pairs of $75 sweat pants.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other shit:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not going to attempt to come up with an adjusted valuation based on comps because there\u2019s too much that makes Under Armour unique compared to Nike and Lululemon (i.e. lawsuits and restructuring), but NKE trades at 5.81x TTM Sales and LULU at 11.15X TTM Sales, while UAA is trading at only 1.61x TTM Sales. But, I would not be surprised if the share price doubled in 2021.</p>\n\n<p>You might also look at the price history and earnings details from Dick&#39;s Sporting Goods, Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors, Hibbett Sports, Sportsman&#39;s Warehouse, etc. to see how sporting goods retailers are doing in 2020. They\u2019re all doing well. Sales are way up. While a lot of that is due to large ticket items and online shopping, foot traffic has actually been fairly strong in sporting goods retailers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am a big believer in brand equity. UnderArmour\u2019s first product line was one of necessity \u2013 Kevin Plank was an offensive lineman on the University of Maryland football team, and realized the world lacked underwear that would keep your ballsack from chafing and wouldn\u2019t bunch up in your ass crack while you\u2019re running. UnderArmour was a pioneer in the compression undergarments and base layers that became popular in sports \u2013 hence the name. For many people, the entire lineup of compression base layer shorts and shirts is still known as Under Armours, in the same way every tissue is a Kleenex.</p>\n\n<p>I believe this is a brand that most people still want to wear. While there has been a lot of blame thrown around by management that its presence in retailers like Kohl\u2019s and JC Penney\u2019s has watered down its \u201cpremium\u201d brand image, I think that\u2019s stupid. UnderArmour\u2019s problems are its own fault. But, the products have always been marketed well and have been high quality. I still have and wear the first UA compression shorts I ever bought back in 2004.</p>\n\n<p>I think Project Rock is a huge development for UnderArmour that will give them the high-end, premium branded gear that they believe they lost over the course of their growth. It\u2019s cool as shit, and I think it\u2019ll give a nice boost to revenues with a nice margin.</p>\n\n<p>As I wrote above, I believe that the completion of the restructuring plan will demonstrably lead to better cash flows in the future as it will streamline the business. I think Under Armour management is desperate for some good press and will provide some kickass guidance on the February earnings call.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this a pump and dump?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No, but thank you for assuming I have enough money to fill a bag.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR \u2013</strong> Under Armour is undervalued. The company was burning cash like crazy from 2017 to 2019 which resulted in deteriorating financial strength, but in 4Q2020 they completed their restructuring plan and did a little high-end rebranding, which all should improve cash flows in the future and make boomer investors happy, which will cause our long-dated calls to print like a motherfucker.</p>\n\n<p>Buy LEAPS, or buy and hold shares for the next 2-3 years if you\u2019re into that kind of thing.</p>\n\n<p>Positions: 5x UA $20c 7/16/2021 and shares of UA, and I\u2019ll be adding more as my GME ROCKETSHIP brings me that moon money. Hopefully this heightens your confidence in me as your personal financial advisor.</p>\n\n<p><a
