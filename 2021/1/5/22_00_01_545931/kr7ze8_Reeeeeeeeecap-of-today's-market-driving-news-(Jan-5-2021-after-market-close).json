DOW got further lifted by action from BA, GS, CVX, and INTC (who's really only being carried by MU). Small caps eclipsed SPX and IXIC today with RUT/IWM up as high as almost 2% during intraday high as value play starts looking more appealing. RUT closed up 1.7% and IWM closed up 1.61%.\n\n* \"I'm totes not dead.\" Says Jack Ma, according to a person familiar with the situation who's relaying the info to a CNBC  reporter on Ma's whereabouts. The beleaguered CEO who's in the crosshair of the CCP is keeping it easy and out of the limelight after running afoul of his overlords by talking up CCP's heavy handed action towards Ant Group. Who knew if your fucking financial empire touches the livelihood of 90% of the country there may be consequences if you don't toe the line. BABA closed the day up 5.51% to $240. Meanwhile, PDD touches new ATH and closed the day up 12.24% to $187 while JD is up 10.61% to $95.\n\n* Many underlying in the Chinese ADR/ADS sector also gets a lift today partly thanks to NYSE's overnight about-face on delisting Chinese Telecoms. BILI hits new ATH and closed up 8.15% to $102.46 thanks to favorable reception from their secondary listing on the Heng Sheng while TCEHY closed the day up 5.23% to $76.66.\n\n* Semi sector is on a run today thanks to MU, with Citi upping, NAND and DRAM manufacturer from Sell all the way up to Buy with a PT of freaking $100 as we enter another cyclical season. RBC Capital also raised PT from $57 to $83, Deutsche Bank from $75 to $83. Will MU $90 be back in favor and no longer a meme strike? Find out later this week. F in the chat for MartyMoho. If only he bought fooking shares and ride through two more additional cyclical season and a global pandemic. Ez dub. MU closed up 4.33% to $77, LRCX closed up 3.46% to $494, and AMAT closed up 3% to $89. MU reports earnings later this Thursday after market close.\n\n* GM popped 2% when news broke at 10:29 on positive US sales number from Q4, and while shares were fading slightly as the market digest the news, eventually the positive momentum took over and shares closed the day up 2.84% to $41.66. ROKU pop to close up 5.44%, closing at $335 thanks to WFC analyst raising PT from $275 to $414 (yep) and keeping his overweight rating. \n\n* Today's big movers: FUBO was up as high as 21%, M-A-R-A was up as high 23% while B-N-G-O drilled more than -30% during intraday lows after an initial halt in the early mornings. FUBO closed up 12.83% to $27.35, M-A-R-A closed up 23.43% to $13.59, and B-N-G-O closed down -31.25% to $4.95.\n\n* The GA run-off election is on the market mindset as voters are heading to the polls. Meanwhile, Congress is set to confirm Biden's win over Trump, a procedural formality that generally receives little news coverage but not in the current timeline. Expect POTUS to rage over Pence on Twitter later tonight if the latter confirms Biden's Electoral College win. Look to weed and clean energy sector for pops if the Dems somehow wins both seat. No doubt many WSBer have already loaded up on FDs to showcase the sick gains porn tomorrow if the magic happens.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR is up more than 5% but those with OTM Jan 15 calls are likely having their ass handed to them by the greeks, while a similar story exist over at GME as the stock fades away morning gain to close the day up 0.70% as theta rampage $20c, $22c, and $23c (if your strike is even further out then RIP to you). MT and steel gang are faring better, with the stock retaking yesterday's high and closed up 2.84% to 24.63. Steel prices continues to rip and earnings will be early next month on Feb 11th.\n\n* Affirm, the online installment loan lender for Americans who can't fucking afford whatever they're buying, is planning to IPO by offering 24 mil shares at $33 to $38 per share.
