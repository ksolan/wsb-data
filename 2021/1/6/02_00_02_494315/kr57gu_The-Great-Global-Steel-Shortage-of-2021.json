{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Disclaimer: I\u2019m not a financial advisor, so do your own DD, and feel free to verify anything I mention below.  Make your own financial decisions.\n\n\n\n**Building a Launch Pad in 2019 - Supply and Demand**\n\nYou have all heard demand is up and supply is down, but what the hell does that actually mean for steel stocks?  To clarify a few points, Global Steel demand has remained largely flat through 2020 and is only expected to rise ~4% in 2021.  Supply is, and has always been the issue here; because of this I will largely ignore the increased demand arguments as they will have minimal impact on current prices unless something major changes like a new infrastructure stimulus bill which is very unlikely short term.  When talking about global Steel/Iron ore prices, you are almost always talking about Chinese Supply/demand.  There are other factors that can affect domestic demand/supply in countries (see India), but for the sake of this DD, I will limit the scope to the Asia Pacific.  With that said, let\u2019s begin.\n\nIn January of 2019 the  C\u00f3rrego do Feij\u00e3o mining complex in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais collapsed, setting the stage for what will now be called the Great Global Steel Shortage of 2021.\n\n*($VALE bois turn away - RIP Jan 2019 calls)*\n\nhttps://www.canadianminingjournal.com/news/iron-ore-video-shows-exact-moment-when-vales-dam-collapsed/\n\nThis disaster not only caused extensive loss of life with more than 240 reported deaths, but it also severely constrained Vale\u2019s iron-ore supply slated for seaborne markets. Authorities ordered a halt in production across many of Vale\u2019s Brazil mines\u2014including at Brucutu, the largest in the Minas Gerais state\u2014output capacity totalling nearly one-quarter of the mining company\u2019s initial 2019 production target of 400 million tonnes was taken offline **(an amount equivalent to around 6 percent of the entire annual global seaborne iron-ore market).** By February, Vale had declared force majeure(unforeseeable circumstances that prevent someone from fulfilling a contract) on the sales contracts of several iron-ore qualities, while volatile weather conditions in the north of Brazil also had an adverse impact on the mining company\u2019s iron-ore operations. By the second quarter, Vale\u2019s production levels were a hefty **34 percent lower vis-a-vis second-quarter 2018 levels.** It has also posted two consecutive quarters of losses in 2019, with a $133-million loss for the second quarter (against a $76-million gain in net income recorded for the same quarter in 2018), adding to the whopping $1.6-billion loss Vale notched up in the first quarter.  \n\nAcross the ocean in March 2019 Cyclone Veronica decided to stop by Western Australia\u2019s Pilbara Coast and force major local iron-ore mines to shut down production. As a result, prices sailed past the $100-per-tonne mark, before being driven even further skywards during the second quarter after Rio Tinto reported dramatic declines in output. The Australian mining giant\u2019s iron-ore production dropped by 7 percent, to 80 million tonnes, during the second quarter compared to the previous year, as bad weather and operational challenges at their mines continued to weigh heavily on capacity. Rio Tinto also slashed its forecast for 2019 shipments. Fellow mining major BHP, meanwhile, also saw annual output for fiscal 2019 decline by 2 percent to 269.6 million tonnes, again partly stemming from the devastating impacts of Australia\u2019s tropical cyclones.\n\nThe two countries represent China\u2019s largest iron-ore suppliers and given the hugely consequential supply problems in Brazil and Australia, China struggled to buy iron ore from the global market as easily as has normally been the case. Data from China\u2019s General Administration of Customs shows that imports declined in June to 75.18 million tonnes, the lowest level since February 2016 and almost 11 percent lower than June 2018 levels. China therefore, tapped its own stockpiles of the commodity to satiate demand from its rampant steel sector. At 115 million tonnes at the end of June 2019, port stockpiles fell to their lowest level in more than two years and were 18 percent lower than 12 months prior. This also meant that only four weeks of inventory supply were on hand for steel producers.  Today those levels are even further diminished to 104.62 tonnes.  S&P Global Market Intelligence, for example, calculated that a 54-million-tonne deficit will transpire for the global seaborne iron-ore market in 2019 and **estimates that it could take another three years before the market returns to a state of balance between production and consumption. S&P chiefly holds the Australian and Brazilian supply disruption responsible for this deficit.**  It's a good thing the deficit only grew to 80million-tonnes in 2020, i mean think of what could happen to the prices!\n\n\n**Assembling the Ship with Excess Steel - Steel Oversupply, Covid and Destocking**\n\nBy March 2020, Chinese steel producers were dealing with soaring finished and semi-finished steel inventories due to a covid infected export market.  Global moves to idle furnaces, and lockdown restrictions were put into effect.  This halt in steel supply put all eyes on China who, short of Feb/March, had been increasing production month over month.  Then something interesting happened, Chinese steel overstocks started to decrease.  By June 2020 those inventories had dissolved, global producers were STILL scaling down furnace production and China for the first time in a decade became a net importer of steel.  Lack of steel inventory, and capped out Chinese production (literally hit an all time production high in October 2020), paired with a global market who had been destocking inventories over the last 2 years, and idled production set sent prices soaring.  A rush to increase production internationally was met with hesitation due to ongoing lockdown concerns, increased ore prices, and lack of global supply iron.  Furnace restarts only started happening in early December.  \n\nHopefully this helps everyone gain an understanding of the current steel situation. The entire supply chain is currently five months behind production, work orders extending out 20 weeks for finished/semi finished steel products, and spot inventories are non-existent.  The idea that we can just ramp up production to fill this gap is met by extreme iron ore shortages.  Recycled scrap has offered temporary relief, but they are also hitting 10 year highs.  Pair all this with a La Ni\u00f1a year in 2021 which will further impact iron supply and 3 consecutive years of destocking; it is becoming increasingly apparent that there is no release available for these prices.\n\nBuy Steel. \ud83d\ude80\n\n\nMy Steel Positions are:\n\n5x MT $24c 4/16\n\n5x MT $24c 6/18\n\n100 STLD - $25.50\n\n100 NUE - $38.79\n\n1,500 X - $7.67\n\n50 - CLF - $10.16", "author_fullname": "t2_80uxn", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "\ud83d\ude80The Great Global Steel Shortage of 2021\ud83d\ude80", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_kr57gu", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 108, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 108, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1609875976.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609902362.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Disclaimer: I\u2019m not a financial advisor, so do your own DD, and feel free to verify anything I mention below.
