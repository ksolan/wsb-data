{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "**What is the impact of the Georgia Election on the Stock market? Is Alibaba going to recover or is it going down? GM outperforms in 2020, let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market recovering a good part of the losses from the first trading day of 2021, as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/P4FW6dK) gained almost 1%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Jd46zGb) rose by .71% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cs47MP1) finished 167 points higher. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kH2gz8v) dropping by more than 6% after the huge spike on Monday as more than 70% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/59qrWLY) on average volume with 109 new highs. We saw 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/hFqx3Gg) finish the day in the green, lead by Energy up over 4% and Materials up over 2%, while Consumer staples finished flat and Utilities & Real Estate just finished in the red.\n\nMost small & mid-cap value & core companies were outperforming [yesterday](https://ibb.co/dWszjdG), as large-caps did finish mostly flat.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gDLn3Bc) from yesterday which revels plenty of gains in most of the areas of the stock market, with Big Tech companies advancing moderately, while most of the Oil& Gas industry finished up significantly higher alongside companies from China.\n\nThe economic data that we received yesterday was mostly positive, starting with bankruptcy fillings falling to the lowest monthly number since early 2006, continuing the trend of this year, as this number, is the [lowest](https://ibb.co/26hzbrN) we have seen since 1986, as companies have been hugely supported by fiscal and monetary policies with record-breaking capital injections.\n\nWe also saw the December ISM Manufacturing [INDEX](https://ibb.co/q73Fj2m) coming at 60.6, higher than the 56.6 expected and the 57.5 in the previous month. This was led by a growth in new orders, productions, prices index & supplier deliveries, while the employment index changed direction and was in expansion territory again this month, standing at 51.5. This was the highest PMI we have seen in 2020, with December being the 7th straight month of [expansion](https://ibb.co/12gpyy2) and the biggest one of this year, with this PMI corresponding to a 5.2% increase in GDP on an annualized basis, as we also saw a 5.5% increase on a yearly basis in the latest Redbook chain store [SALES](https://ibb.co/qWjH5dJ).\n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/2n4jcFm) we continue to get auto sales numbers, MBA mortgage applications, ADP jobs numbers, factory orders and a final read on the PMI composite, as we also await the Georgia Runoff [ELECTION](https://ibb.co/zXyZWmR) final results, as right now one of the seats has been called by multiple media channels for the Democrats while the other one is still too tight to call.\n\nIf the Dems to sweep, this could cause an increased volatility in the markets, especially in the tech sectors as investors would probably overreact and just start selling off. This could be a good buying opportunity in my opinion, as I believe it\u2019s very unlikely that even if Democrats do have the power to make big changes, which is very unlikely on big & important subjects as they themselves are divided on many subjects, they wouldn\u2019t do that when things are still very bad in the economy, and the future still looks uncertain. Things should get better before any \u201cbig tax changes\u201d or any other \u201cbig regulation changes\u201d. So, if the Dems win the other seat, expect volatility, that could lead to a healthy correction after a huge run or a consolidation period before the markets recovers. So, I just wouldn\u2019t bet against the bull market that we are in right now.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that Alibaba is [planning](https://ibb.co/s2vb2L8) to raise $5B through bonds again, following the 2014 and 2017 capital raising operation, with the company also getting downgraded at CFRA to a sell [rating](https://ibb.co/QbJwG53) while also cutting their PT from $280 to $210. I know the political factors are really pushing this stock in the wrong direction, but after all of this will pass, Alibaba is still a great company, even [without](https://ibb.co/m4x7CCs) Ant Group and despite the latest moves by trump to continue banning Chinese [APPS](https://ibb.co/X8xr9Cs), with the latest big ones being Alipay & WeChat Pay. In my opinion this is a severe overreaction as long-term investing goes. Yeah, maybe in the short-term the company can go either way depending on what restrictions they get, but I really don\u2019t think Alibaba will go bust in the long-run.\n\nYesterday we also receive auto sales number from a couple of manufacturers, with [GM](https://ibb.co/6HhqwZr) stealing the show, with Q4 sales up almost 5% year/year, as the company estimated they gained market share in both retail and fleet deliveries in 2020, while NISSAN\u2019s [sales](https://ibb.co/gFhYd60) continued to drop, as they sold 19% less vehicles in Q4 over the last quarter, as the total sales in 2020 dropped by more than 33%, as the automaker has fallen out of flavor with outdated models and no innovative developments.\n\nMeanwhile [VW](https://ibb.co/st5S7fh) did slightly worse overall in 2020, but saw a 11% increase in sales in Q4, as this was led by a 22% increase in the total SUVs sold. The SUV trend continues to keep on getting more & more meaningful and most automakers must try and compete in this highly demanded market if they do want to survive. If you do want to invest in this industry, I suggest you take a look at the product development & future outlook for the company before. I think both GM & Ford are going in the right direction, but you should do your own research.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [world](https://ibb.co/55PMcBq) stock markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bN3RK87) seem to be pointing to a mixed open, with the Dow leading the way, while the tech heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1.3% on panic selling & portfolio rebalancing happening due to the possible Democratic sweep in Georgia.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!
