{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Greetings to all who read this,\n\ntoday I am sharing some due-diligence I recently did on $QS. QS has been a hot stock in recent months having made large moves, both up and down. They also entered the market as a SPAC and as they are intensely research-based, have no prior financials worth noting. So this dd post focuses on their innovation and their management and recent news. I hope you all enjoy it and look forward to any discussion!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**QUANTUMSCAPES DUE DILIGENCE (5th Jan)**\n\nIntro to QS: \" QuantumScape Corp. engages in the provision of energy storage solutions. It focuses on the development of solid-state lithium-metal batteries for use in electric vehicles. The company was founded by Jagdeep Singh, Tim Holme, and Fritz B. Prinz in May 2010 and is headquartered in San Jose, CA. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*First I checked their ratings and trend summary on* [*stockinvest.us*](https://stockinvest.us)*. Here is what I found:*\n\n\u00b7 Rated as sell on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) (changed to buy on the 6th Jan)\n\n\u00b7 Trending search for the day/week though (bullish - investor sentiment shows hype and interest)\n\n* \u201cQS Stock Risk:\n\nThis stock may move very much during a day (volatility) and with a very large prediction interval from the Bollinger Band this stock is considered to be \"very high risk\". During the last day, the stock moved **$13.60** between high and low, or **28.69%**. For the last week, the stock has had a daily average volatility of **17.36%**.\n\nOur recommended stop-loss: **We hold a sell evaluation for this stock. No stop-loss set.\"**\n\n\u00b7 Volume has increased on the 4th (of January) by 69 million shares but on falling prices.\n\n\u00b7 Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise **185.84%** during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between **$142.81** and **$406.18** at the end of this 3-month period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Next I checked Motley Fool (although I have no confidence in their analysis overall), to see what they had to say:*\n\n\u00b7 QuantumScape is several years from commercial production, and its current [market capitalization](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/what-is-market-cap/) is still over $18 billion. Investors who want to speculate on the potential of QuantumScape and its business need to plan on a lot of volatility in the years leading up to its technology going to market.\n\n\u00b7 Investors have jumped in, excited about the potential, but QuantumScape will soon have a lot more shares trading. The company updated an S-1 filing at end of December registering more than 300 million shares, with at least 60 million not subject to any lockup agreement and able to be sold as soon as the filing gets the rubber stamp from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\u00b7 More shares available typically means downward pressure on a stock. In this case it is existing holders, and not the company, selling shares, meaning QuantumScape would get no cash from the offering. But existing shares could feel some near-term downward pressure (which they have since mid-late December).\n\n\u00b7 We'll likely know when the registration becomes official (probably sometime January) when we see a spike in the volume of shares traded and probably another down day for the shares (likely the increase in volume and decrease in price mentioned on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) on the 4th). It's hard to read too much into options pricing, but if options are to be believed some investors are pricing in the potential for the stock to lose $20 or more in the weeks to come.\n\n\u00b7 QuantumScape was a breath of fresh air as it hit the public markets after its [reverse merger](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/13/why-kensington-capital-is-charging-higher-today/) with Kensington Acquisition Corp. in November.\n\n\u00b7 QuantumScape, in partnership with **Volkswagen**, expects to begin construction of a 1-gigawatt hour (GWh) pilot facility in 2021. If successful, QuantumScape will expand the project to a 20-GWh facility. To put this in perspective, consider that in mid-2018 Tesla reported that battery production of its Gigafactory in Nevada achieved annualized battery production of about 20 GWh.\n\n\u00b7 While management foresees the company reporting $275 million in revenue and $73 million in gross profit for 2026, QuantumScape estimates that the following year, the top line and gross profit will skyrocket to $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Likewise, the company believes that 2027 will be the year it starts to report positive [EBITDA](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/ebitda.aspx) \\-- approximately $808 million.\n\n\u00b7  Since 2012, Volkswagen has provided more than $300 million in funding to QuantumScape, making it the company's largest investor -- though it maintains a minority stake. In 2018, Volkswagen and QuantumScape formed a 50/50 joint venture, one of the goals of which is to produce solid-state batteries for Volkswagen's EVs on a mass scale.\n\n\u00b7 Thanks to the joint venture and pilot facility, QuantumScape envisions that Volkswagen will be the first to commercialize its solid-state batteries. But QuantumScape demonstrated in a recent filing that its dance card is hardly full, stating that \"subject to the other terms of the joint venture arrangements, we are not limited from working in parallel with other automotive OEMs to commercialize our technology.\"\n\n\u00b7 While QuantumScape is singularly focused on developing its solid-state batteries for EVs, the company recognizes that its technology may be used in other applications, such as stationary storage, smartphones, and wearables. While the company may, in time, pursue the latter two markets, it seems that stationary storage is closest to the company's current focus; moreover, it's one that certainly represents a significant opportunity. According to Lux Research, the stationary storage market, which represented installations of 164 GWh in 2019, is expected to grow at a 20% compound annual growth rate through 2035, when it will reach installations totaling 3,046 GWh.\n\n\u00b7 Apple has a [mountain of cash](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/cash-is-king/), and one could speculate that it would acquire a company with the right technology. QuantumScape highlighted its technology in a presentation earlier this month. The solid-state technology charges to 80% capacity in just 15 minutes, has greater than a 300 mile range, has a long usage life, and is non-combustible.\n\n\u00b7 The company is notably backed by both **Volkswagen** ([OTC:VWAGY](https://www.fool.com/quote/otc/volkswagen-aktiengesellschaft/vwagy/)) and Bill Gates. Whether investors are speculating about an Apple investment is anyone's guess. Moves could also be driven by thinking that other potential customers will want to partner with QuantumScape if they have to compete against an Apple EV.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*After this, I went to Simply Wall St. to get an overview of management and financials:*\n\n## \u00b7Shahmoon Keller PLLC Files Suit on Behalf of Holders of QuantumScape Corporation Warrants\n\n\u00b7 Shahmoon Keller PLLC announced that the Supreme Court of the State of New York in Manhattan has scheduled an injunction hearing for January 19, 2021 in a class action lawsuit on behalf of holders of warrants to purchase stock of QuantumScape Corporation. QuantumScape, the successor to Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp. by virtue of a business combination that closed on November 25, 2020, stated in its proxy statement and prospectus that the warrants \u201cwill become exercisable 30 days after the consummation of the Business Combination. QuantumScape subsequently asserted that the warrants could not be exercised until June 30, 2021, at the earliest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Their management is excellently qualified and highly respected in their field of expertise, with many years experience and strong motivation. At the minimum this is evident in their Co-Founder:*\n\n\u00b7 Mr. Jagdeep Singh is a Co-Founder of QuantumScape Corporation since May 2010 and has been its Chief Executive Officer and Director since May 2010 and serves as its Chairman since November 2020. Prior to that, Mr. Singh served as the President and General Manager of CIENA Corporation's Core Switching Division. He co-founded Infinera Corporation in 2001 and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer from January 2001 to December 31, 2009. He was the Founder of OnFiber and served as its Chief Executive Officer. He was the Founder of Lightera Networks and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer. He served as the Chairman of Onfiber Communications Inc. He served as Chairman of Infinera Corporation from March 2001 to October 14, 2010 and Executive Chairman from January 2010 to October 2010. He serves as a Member of Policy Board at EsNet, Inc. He serves as a Member of the Advisory Council at Stanford Graduate School of Business. He serves as a Member of Advisory Board of RWI Ventures. He served as a Director of Infinera until October 2010. He served as a Director of CIENA. Mr. Singh holds an MS in Computer Science from Stanford University, an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley, and a BS in Computer Science from the University of Maryland.\n\n* Over 50% of current shares are held by either insiders, institutions, public companies or Venture Capitalist Firms.\n* Top 15 shareholders own 57.19% of the companies shares. Among the top 15 include the likes of:\n\n1. Porsche automobil Holding, with 19.56% ownership,\n2. Khosla Ventures LLC, with 9.76%,\n3. Capricorn Investment LLC, with 6.71%\n4. L. Doerr , with 5.59% and\n5. Jagdeep Singh with 4.84%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Next, I filtered through a Google search, focusing on news involving QS or its shareholders. This is what I found:*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* NEW YORK, Jan. 04, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [**Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz LLP**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d7DcVPN4nJvLQkcksRpxinmXVVLrJDxKXZ51kUy069jt6KYCVWfxv-xmrrVleGnnjI41ZIjHtVkE7V1tBU-F7u6qoBkkbZq2k4sxaA3WGwbEZTD6Y14D4iXLD4nmgqDb) announces that it has commenced an investigation of QuantumScape Corporation (\u201cQuantumScape\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NASDAQ: QS) on behalf of investors concerning the Company\u2019s possible violations of federal securities laws.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* On January 4, 2021, *Seeking Alpha* published an article pointing to several risks with QuantumScape\u2019s solid state batteries that make it *\u201ccompletely unacceptable for real world field electric vehicles.\u201d* Specifically, it stated that the battery\u2019s power means it \u201c*will only last for 260 cycles or about 75,000 miles of aggressive driving.\u201d* As solid state batteries are temperature sensitive, *\u201cthe power and cycle tests at 30 and 45 degrees above would have been significantly worse if run even a few degrees lower.\u201d*\n\nOn this news, the Company\u2019s stock price fell almost 40% during intraday trading on January 4, 2021.\n\n[**Wolf Haldenstein**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d7DcVPN4nJvLQkcksRpxilkDLpHhrmI0w9pWxLiwZxzgbfa0LW6wu-ssajWNDjgU-zgz7CpsCaXj9SXd2mcPUg==) has extensive experience in the prosecution of securities class actions and derivative litigation in state and federal trial and appellate courts across the country. The firm has attorneys in various practice areas and offices in New York, Chicago and San Diego. The reputation and expertise of this firm in shareholder and other class litigation has been repeatedly recognized by the courts, which have appointed it to major positions in complex securities multi-district and consolidated litigation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* MILWAUKEE, Jan. 4, 2021 /Newswire/ -- Ademi LLP is investigating possible securities fraud claims against QuantumScape (NASDAQ: QS) resulting from inaccurate statements QuantumScape made regarding its business operations and prospects.\n\nClick here to learn more about the investigation: [http://ademilaw.com/case/quantumscape-corporation](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3025642-1&h=1038669832&u=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation&a=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation).\n\nThe investigation focuses on whether QuantumScape properly disclosed the significant limitations of its solid-state battery products in order to be acceptable for real world field electric vehicle performance. Specifically, according to a Seeking Alpha research report, QuantumScape's solid state battery products (i) last only for \"260 cycles or about 75,000 miles of aggressive driving\", (ii) have a daily range of only about \"75-100 miles at full capacity in winter temperature conditions\", (iii) will charge only to 5% in 15 minutes rather than 80% at 15 minutes in winter conditions, and (iv) will have an energy density lower than competitors.\n\nIf you wish to obtain additional information or have information about this investigation of Splunk, please contact X....\n\n[http://ademilaw.com/case/quantumscape-corporation](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3025642-1&h=1038669832&u=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation&a=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation).\n\n**Also of interest, I found a Bloomberg Article outlining all the key points from above, with bullish outlook:**\n\n[https://archive.vn/Thdc8](https://archive.vn/Thdc8)\n\nFor anyone willing to dive deep enough, I recommend having a look through their patent applications on Google Patents here: [https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Quantumscape&oq=Quantumscape&sort=new&page=1](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Quantumscape&oq=Quantumscape&sort=new&page=1)\n\nAlso, a quick Google Scholar search on solid-state lithium batteries, should be enough to satisfy the battery nerds out there. Some really great articles, and research on this stuff, showing huge potential.\n\nI also highly recommend everyone interested, to watch the following. It is the investors presentation, released on 8th December, on Youtube. It contains more information on their actual breakthrough btteries than I have above.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGnPSkXKb0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGnPSkXKb0I)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, check out r/QuantumScape for even more dd if you desire.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Tl;dr:\n\n* Overall bullish, the tech, if all data and results are true representations, is extremely advanced. It will be the future.\n* But production doesnt start until 2025 at the soonest. There have been accusations that the results and data were exaggerated, fabricated or whatever else usually follows success. Ongoing investigations are likely to turn up nothing though.\n* Management and the board overall are extremely experienced and likely trustworthy. They are and will continue to be the best they can be at what they do.\n* There are some extra shares floating around that may suppress price for a couple of weeks or so. And with a huge run up already after happening, it is unlikely to see another for a couple weeks/months again, minimum.\n* People are comparing it to Tesla already. There are also some competitors, some of them Chinese, some of them just other car companies, such as Toyota and GM. Also EV stocks in general are hot/are getting bad rep because of valuations.\n* In terms of technical analysis, I predict a big move upwards over the next few week/months.\n* Long term (5+ years) this could go up 1,000% from current prices if they deliver on all their promises, and especially if they overdeliver. That would be extremely bullish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, as a side note, I want to give a special mention to c.b.a.t (mods have banned because of market cap), another battery maker. All the hype surrounding EV's and Battery companies could cause c.b.a.t to go on a huge bullish run. For reference, it is already up around 30% over the last week or so, and could easily rise another 100%+ from here, with a current price of only \\~$9. I am personally going long both.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you have all enjoyed my dd on QS, as much as I enjoyed putting it together! I hope to see big things from them in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYours truly,\n\nNathMcLovin!", "author_fullname": "t2_5i4oa2sx", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "QantumScape Corporation Due-Diligence!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_ksenyv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610059633.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Greetings to all who read this,</p>\n\n<p>today I am sharing some due-diligence I recently did on $QS.

Specifically, according to a Seeking Alpha research report, QuantumScape&#39;s solid state battery products (i) last only for &quot;260 cycles or about 75,000 miles of aggressive driving&quot;, (ii) have a daily range of only about &quot;75-100 miles at full capacity in winter temperature conditions&quot;, (iii) will charge only to 5% in 15 minutes rather than 80% at 15 minutes in winter conditions, and (iv) will have an energy density lower than competitors.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to obtain additional information or have information about this investigation of Splunk, please contact X....</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3025642-1&amp;h=1038669832&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation\">http://ademilaw.com/case/quantumscape-corporation</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Also of interest, I found a Bloomberg Article outlining all the key points from above, with bullish outlook:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.vn/Thdc8\">https://archive.vn/Thdc8</a></p>\n\n<p>For anyone willing to dive deep enough, I recommend having a look through their patent applications on Google Patents here: <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Quantumscape&amp;oq=Quantumscape&amp;sort=new&amp;page=1\">https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Quantumscape&amp;oq=Quantumscape&amp;sort=new&amp;page=1</a></p>\n\n<p>Also, a quick Google Scholar search on solid-state lithium batteries, should be enough to satisfy the battery nerds out there. Some really great articles, and research on this stuff, showing huge potential.</p>\n\n<p>I also highly recommend everyone interested, to watch the following. It is the investors presentation, released on 8th December, on Youtube. It contains more information on their actual breakthrough btteries than I have above.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGnPSkXKb0I\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGnPSkXKb0I</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, check out <a href=\"/r/QuantumScape\">r/QuantumScape</a> for even more dd if you desire.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>My Tl;dr:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Overall bullish, the tech, if all data and results are true representations, is extremely advanced. It will be the future.</li>\n<li>But production doesnt start until 2025 at the soonest. There have been accusations that the results and data were exaggerated, fabricated or whatever else usually follows success. Ongoing investigations are likely to turn up nothing though.</li>\n<li>Management and the board overall are extremely experienced and likely trustworthy. They are and will continue to be the best they can be at what they do.</li>\n<li>There are some extra shares floating around that may suppress price for a couple of weeks or so. And with a huge run up already after happening, it is unlikely to see another for a couple weeks/months again, minimum.</li>\n<li>People are comparing it to Tesla already. There are also some competitors, some of them Chinese, some of them just other car companies, such as Toyota and GM. Also EV stocks in general are hot/are getting bad rep because of valuations.</li>\n<li>In terms of technical analysis, I predict a big move upwards over the next few week/months.</li>\n<li>Long term (5+ years) this could go up 1,000% from current prices if they deliver on all their promises, and especially if they overdeliver. That would be extremely bullish.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Also, as a side note, I want to give a special mention to c.b.a.t (mods have banned because of market cap), another battery maker. All the hype surrounding EV&#39;s and Battery companies could cause c.b.a.t to go on a huge bullish run. For reference, it is already up around 30% over the last week or so, and could easily rise another 100%+ from here, with a current price of only ~$9. I am personally going long both.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I hope you have all enjoyed my dd on QS, as much as I enjoyed putting it together! I hope to see big things from them in the future.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Yours truly,</p>\n\n<p>NathMcLovin!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "5692ce02-b860-11e5-b542-0edc7016bbd3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#365b8c", "id": "ksenyv", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": {"name": "NathMcLovin", "fullname": "t2_5i4oa2sx"}, "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 6, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ksenyv/qantumscape_corporation_duediligence/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ksenyv/qantumscape_corporation_duediligence/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1779988, "created_utc": 1610030833.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false, "comment_limit": 2048, "comment_sort": "confidence", "comments": [{"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_ksenyv", "author_flair_template_id": "28fbe25a-7c59-11ea-965e-0e0a65cd3f97", "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gifgrpv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": {"name": "WSBVoteBot", "fullname": "t2_26k75u4f"}, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ksenyv", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_26k75u4f", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "body": "**I am a bot.
