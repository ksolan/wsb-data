Hope you fuckers listened last time  \n   \n\\*I have to actually spell out the company name because this dumb subreddit thinks its still a spac (its not and hasn\u2019t been since 2018). The ticker is just the first letter of each word\n\nHopefully you listened to me last time:  \n \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaskh2/infrastructure\\_and\\_energy\\_alternative\\_is\\_the\\_next/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaskh2/infrastructure_and_energy_alternative_is_the_next/)\n\nYou probably didn\u2019t and chased some shitty call option that failed.\n\nAt the time of that post Infrastructure and Energy Alternative commons were at $11.30 and warrants at $1.50. Commons now are tickling $20 (almost double) and warrants around 4 (2.5x gain). Not bad.\n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering why I would still recommend Infrastructure and Energy Alternative after the nice run it has had recently. Well, with 2bn in revenue and now with the dems taking Georgia, we are going to see TRILLIONS of dollars pour into green energy this year and onwards. The best part is Infrastructure and Energy Alternative still sits at a paltry 420mm market cap (less than 0.25x revenue). \n\nYesterday you saw all 3 othet green energy stocks: Cleanspark, FCEL and PLUG run 30% even though all 3 are already madly overvalued. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is the best deal of the 3 and still has a ton of room to run. It is clear that green energy is going to boom this year.\n\nMotley fool had an interesting mention of Infrastructure and Energy Alternative today too:  \n [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/why-blink-charging-vulcan-materials-and-infrastruc/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/why-blink-charging-vulcan-materials-and-infrastruc/)\n\nI know you won\u2019t click the link to read it but here is the important part  \n \n\n*Indeed, Infrastructure & Energy Alternatives just might turn out to be the most promising of these three stock opportunities. Although the company reported only $13.2 million in net profit over the past 12 months according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), that number is more than twice what Infrastructure and Energy Alternative earned last year. Moreover, free cash flow generation at Infrastructure and Energy Alternative was a very robust $68.6 million over the past year. At a market capitalization of just $410 million, that works out to an ultra-cheap price-to-free cash flow ratio of less than six.*\n\n*Almost entirely uncovered on Wall Street, Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives could be\u00a0the\u00a0small-cap stock to watch in 2021.*\n\nBest part, like they just mentioned, is Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is STILL NOT DISCOVERED BY WALL STREET. This is still ground floor. Potential ENPH type move in 2021 for Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. \ud83d\ude80\n\nIf you look at the Infrastructure and Energy Alternative chart, there is a very obvious pattern that has been happening since summer. It moons roughly 80-100% then dips 30% and consolidates\u2026 rinse and repeat. It looks like it just finished its recent consolidation in the 16-17 area and is ready for its next leg up to $30.\n\nFunds have been adding mad in the most recent consolidation period between $15-$17. The volume is regularly over 1million now when just a month ago it was a struggle to hit 500-700k. It is clear that funds are starting to find Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. It was also recently added to a few ETF\u2019s and index\u2019s. \n\nIMO Infrastructure and Energy Alternative will see $30 relatively soon. $30 on the commons gives us $10 warrants. When you hit the $10 warrants (or whatever price youre happy with) you can then flip then into the commons and let them ride throughout 2021.\n\nYou can obviously buy calls but I think warrants are the better deal here for the potential 100% move + in the short and midterm.\n\nP.s. read through my previous wsb post (link at the top) if youre interested in the deeper numbers regarding Infrastructure and Energy Alternative.
