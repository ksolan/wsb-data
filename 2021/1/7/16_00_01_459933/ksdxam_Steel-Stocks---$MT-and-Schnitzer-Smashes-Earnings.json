{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "From Zack\u2019s: (more confirmation)\n\n4 Steel Stocks Set to Gain on Spurred Up Demand in 2021\n\nMentioned:\tMT RYI SC.HN ZEUS\n\nThe steel industry in the United States now seems poised to make a comeback from the COVID-19 led slump during the earlier part of last year. Demand for the metal is gradually returning as manufacturers are springing to action. Notably, increased demand has led to higher steel prices. Per S&P Global Platts, the benchmark price for hot-rolled steel hit a two-year high of $900 per ton in December 2020, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal article.\n\nMoreover, the American Iron and Steel Institute reported that in the week ending Jan 2, production increased 3.1% from the week ending Dec 26, 2020. Capacity utilization also improved to 80.1% from the previous week\u2019s capacity utilization of 72.3%. Although weekly productions were down on a year-over-year basis, the uptick in production from the prior holiday-induced week bodes well.\n\nReflective of the uptick in demand for steel, manufacturing activity has also been expanding in the United States. Per the latest report from the Institute for Supply Management, the purchasing manager\u2019s index for December was 60.7% compared to 57.5% in November, marking the eighth consecutive month of growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Steel Association (\u201cworldsteel\u201d) also forecast in a report that global demand for steel will rise 4.1% in 2021 following an estimated slump of 2.4% in 2020. Moreover, worldsteel predicted that demand for steel in the United States should increase 6.6% in 2021 following an estimated drop of 15.8% in 2020.\n\nSeparately, global production of light vehicles is expected to rebound in 2021. This rebound will be important because the automotive industry is a major contributor to demand for steel. Notably, IHS Markit estimated global light vehicle production to rebound 14% to 84.3 million units in 2021, following an estimated dip of 17% in 2020, as quoted in a Business Wire article. The article further mentioned that in North America, IHS Markit forecast a production increase of 29% on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of 2021 following a cautious view of the first quarter.\n\n4 Steel Stocks to Buy Now\n\nThe outlook for the demand for steel is gradually improving. Steel prices have witnessed an uptick and reflective of the rising demand, manufacturing activity has also continued to expand. Meanwhile, production of light vehicles is also expected to rebound in 2021, a development that bodes well for the steel industry.
