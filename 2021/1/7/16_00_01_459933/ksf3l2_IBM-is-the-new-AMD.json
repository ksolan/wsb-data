About 6 years ago, I saw a little noticed the after the-bell earnings report for AMD. Back then AMD wasn't the OG millionaire printer they are today. They were a has-been boomer stock, that went up against Intel, lost big time, and were on the verge of bankruptcy. For almost a decade AMD was mismanaged, producing 2nd rate video cards and 3rd rate processors. They spent all their money and talent designing low margin chips for OEMs and one off projects (gaming consoles mostly) and spun off their manufacturing arm in a frenzied bid to stay afloat. But after this earnings report AMD jumped like 30%, from jack-shit to 30% higher than jack-shit. The reason for that is of course, Su Bae and her brilliant operational excellence. Anyone who took note of AMD back then is now rich as shit as the stock has climbed 30x since that little earnings report.\nI could give you a history lesson about AMD, but this DD isn't about AMD. That ship has sailed and at best you're looking at a 2-3 bagger, complete with a massive implied vol on the options which would completely drown your gains.\n\nNo, this story goes back farther than AMD. Before Lisa Su was queen of the CPU racket, she spent a decade at a little company called IBM. The ones who made the Thinkpads your dad was using while getting a BJ from his secretary under his desk, real 90s shit. This was a boomer stock before there were boomer stocks.\nSo why the fuck am I doing a DD about IBM? Because this is the year it all turns around for IBM.\n\nI could go on about IBM trades at a 14.5 times P/E and has a 5% dividend yield, but that's the opposite of what you want to hear. Don't worry, they keep making less money each year, so that sweet boomer dividend will be gone before you know it.\n\nIBM is spinning off their legacy business that makes all the money, but is making less of it each year, and their Redhat/AI/Cloud business into two separate companies. Now if the market weren't full of Chads who only want to see y/y earnings growth %, having a free second cash cow business that paid the dividend while your AI and Cloud business grew would be seen as a good thing. So if you have IBM when they complete the split, and you can ditch the dividend shares if you want.\n\nNow some \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b think IBM can't turn around because their legacy business is declining. But IBM is now on the path towards competing with Microsoft and Amazon. They bought Redhat, which every tech company uses. They have analytics, they have quantum computing, they have ai/machine learning, they have blockchain, and they're making \"hybrid-cloud\", which is just part cloud, part onsite, which governments and companies with sensitive information will love. Something Microsoft and Amazon don't do. Now don't get me wrong, IBM has been saying they were going to do all this for years, but last spring they finally put in a CEO who can steer the ship in the wrong direction.\n\nArvind Krishna, remember the name.
