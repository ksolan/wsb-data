You think Palantir are the good guys?\n\nEDIT: Well, since you don't seem to want to answer the question and I'm being accused of stalling, I will say this. \n\nPalantir cares about America and American values exactly in the same way that the NSA does. \n\n1. The two investors who put up the money to found Palantir are Peter Thiel and the CIA (look up In-Q-Tel, the CIA's venture capital firm)\n\n\n2. Palantir is a data mining firm that processes your data for the American Intelligence community. \n\n3. Palantir offers a product called \"Palantir Metropolis\" that firms like JP Morgan use to monitor employee communications and alert the insider threat team when an employee showed any signs of potential disgruntlement: the insider alert team would further scrutinize the employee and possibly conduct physical surveillance after hours with bank security personnel. The Metropolis team used emails, download activity, browser histories, and GPS locations from JPMorgan owned smartphones and their transcripts of digitally recorded phone conversations to search, aggregate, sort, and analyze this information for any specific keywords, phrases, and patterns of behavior.\n\n\n\n3. Palantir uses tools they have developed for US intelligence agencies to fight the \"War On Terror\" to track and monitor American citizens. \n\n\n4. Palantir is the company that helped Cambridge Analytica to use the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users to develop psychographic profiles of individual voters.\n\n5. Palantir drew up a proposal for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to run a secret sabotage campaign against the group\u2019s liberal opponents. Hacked emails released by the group Anonymous indicated that Palantir and two other defense contractors pitched outside lawyers for the organization on a plan to snoop on the families of progressive activists, create fake identities to infiltrate left-leaning groups, scrape social media with bots, and plant false information with liberal groups to subsequently discredit them.\n\n\n\n6. The LAPD uses Palantir\u2019s Gotham product for Operation Laser, a program to identify and deter people likely to commit crimes. Information from rap sheets, parole reports, police interviews, and other sources is fed into the system to generate a list of people the department defines as chronic offenders, says Craig Uchida, whose consulting firm, Justice & Security Strategies Inc., designed the Laser system. The list is distributed to patrolmen, with orders to monitor and stop the pre-crime suspects as often as possible, using excuses such as jaywalking or fix-it tickets. At each contact, officers fill out a field interview card with names, addresses, vehicles, physical descriptions, any neighborhood intelligence the person offers, and the officer\u2019s own observations on the subject.\n\nMore on Project Gotham.\n\nThe cards are digitized in the Palantir system, adding to a constantly expanding surveillance database that\u2019s fully accessible without a warrant. Tomorrow\u2019s data points are automatically linked to today\u2019s, with the goal of generating investigative leads. Say a chronic offender is tagged as a passenger in a car that\u2019s pulled over for a broken taillight. Two years later, that same car is spotted by an automatic license plate reader near a crime scene 200 miles across the state. As soon as the plate hits the system, Palantir alerts the officer who made the original stop that a car once linked to the chronic offender was spotted near a crime scene.\n\nThe platform is supplemented with what sociologist Sarah Brayne calls the secondary surveillance network: the web of who is related to, friends with, or sleeping with whom. One woman in the system, for example, who wasn\u2019t suspected of committing any crime, was identified as having multiple boyfriends within the same network of associates, says Brayne, who spent two and a half years embedded with the LAPD while researching her dissertation on big-data policing at Princeton University and who\u2019s now an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cAnybody who logs into the system can see all these intimate ties,\u201d she says.

You think Palantir are the good guys?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Well, since you don&#39;t seem to want to answer the question and I&#39;m being accused of stalling, I will say this. </p>\n\n<p>Palantir cares about America and American values exactly in the same way that the NSA does. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The two investors who put up the money to found Palantir are Peter Thiel and the CIA (look up In-Q-Tel, the CIA&#39;s venture capital firm)</p></li>\n<li><p>Palantir is a data mining firm that processes your data for the American Intelligence community. </p></li>\n<li><p>Palantir offers a product called &quot;Palantir Metropolis&quot; that firms like JP Morgan use to monitor employee communications and alert the insider threat team when an employee showed any signs of potential disgruntlement: the insider alert team would further scrutinize the employee and possibly conduct physical surveillance after hours with bank security personnel. The Metropolis team used emails, download activity, browser histories, and GPS locations from JPMorgan owned smartphones and their transcripts of digitally recorded phone conversations to search, aggregate, sort, and analyze this information for any specific keywords, phrases, and patterns of behavior.</p></li>\n<li><p>Palantir uses tools they have developed for US intelligence agencies to fight the &quot;War On Terror&quot; to track and monitor American citizens. </p></li>\n<li><p>Palantir is the company that helped Cambridge Analytica to use the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users to develop psychographic profiles of individual voters.</p></li>\n<li><p>Palantir drew up a proposal for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to run a secret sabotage campaign against the group\u2019s liberal opponents. Hacked emails released by the group Anonymous indicated that Palantir and two other defense contractors pitched outside lawyers for the organization on a plan to snoop on the families of progressive activists, create fake identities to infiltrate left-leaning groups, scrape social media with bots, and plant false information with liberal groups to subsequently discredit them.</p></li>\n<li><p>The LAPD uses Palantir\u2019s Gotham product for Operation Laser, a program to identify and deter people likely to commit crimes. Information from rap sheets, parole reports, police interviews, and other sources is fed into the system to generate a list of people the department defines as chronic offenders, says Craig Uchida, whose consulting firm, Justice &amp; Security Strategies Inc., designed the Laser system. The list is distributed to patrolmen, with orders to monitor and stop the pre-crime suspects as often as possible, using excuses such as jaywalking or fix-it tickets. At each contact, officers fill out a field interview card with names, addresses, vehicles, physical descriptions, any neighborhood intelligence the person offers, and the officer\u2019s own observations on the subject.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>More on Project Gotham.</p>\n\n<p>The cards are digitized in the Palantir system, adding to a constantly expanding surveillance database that\u2019s fully accessible without a warrant. Tomorrow\u2019s data points are automatically linked to today\u2019s, with the goal of generating investigative leads. Say a chronic offender is tagged as a passenger in a car that\u2019s pulled over for a broken taillight. Two years later, that same car is spotted by an automatic license plate reader near a crime scene 200 miles across the state. As soon as the plate hits the system, Palantir alerts the officer who made the original stop that a car once linked to the chronic offender was spotted near a crime scene.</p>\n\n<p>The platform is supplemented with what sociologist Sarah Brayne calls the secondary surveillance network: the web of who is related to, friends with, or sleeping with whom. One woman in the system, for example, who wasn\u2019t suspected of committing any crime, was identified as having multiple boyfriends within the same network of associates, says Brayne, who spent two and a half years embedded with the LAPD while researching her dissertation on big-data policing at Princeton University and who\u2019s now an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cAnybody who logs into the system can see all these intimate ties,\u201d she says. To widen the scope of possible connections, she adds, the LAPD has also explored purchasing private data, including social media, foreclosure, and toll road information, camera feeds from hospitals, parking lots, and universities, and delivery information from Papa John\u2019s International Inc. and Pizza Hut LLC.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/jpmorgan-used-palantir-tools-monitor-employee-activity-bloomberg-report.html\">https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/jpmorgan-used-palantir-tools-monitor-employee-activity-bloomberg-report.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-palantir-peter-thiel/\">https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-palantir-peter-thiel/</a></p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a lot more but you get teh general gist.
