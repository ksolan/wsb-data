{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "Tl;dr If Apple partners with Hyundai, it will most likely be based on the Canoo base platform. This is purely speculation, but grounded in real facts based on looking at the primary area of collaboration for Hyundai's EV partners, Canoo's founders' history with Apple and Canoo's investor presentation.\n\nLet's dive into the FACTS:\nHyundai is in early talks to develop self-driving electric vehicles with Apple [Link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/hyundai-motor-says-it-is-in-early-talks-with-apple.html). Hyundai also has a couple partnerships to co-develop EVs with Rimac, Arrival and Canoo\n\nFirst take note that in Apple's initial press release, they announced they would be focused on a \"personal, mass-market vehicle rather than a robotaxi or commercial vehicle\" [Link](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35036439/apple-car-2024/)\n\nFor this reason, Canoo is the most likely partner. I'll illustrate using a quote from a press release where it mentions the focus of the Canoo partnership is on small, cost-competitive EVs + PBVs (in other words, mass market vehicles), which is the market Apple is focused on. [Link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia)\n\"Canoo and Hyundai Motor Group, Hyundai and Kia\u2019s parent company, will develop a new electric vehicle platform that\u2019s based on the one that powers Canoo\u2019s own vehicle, which was unveiled last year. This EV platform will power small, \u201ccost-competitive\u201d electric vehicles, as well as \u201cpurpose built vehicles,\u201d which would more closely resemble shuttles or even autonomous people-movers.\"\n\nThe reason it is much less likely to be with Arrival or Rimac is based on reading their partnership announcements with Hyundai as well.\n\nFrom Arrival article [Link](https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/company/newsroom/hyundai-and-kia-make-strategic-investment-in-arrival-to-co-develop-electric-commercial-vehicles-0000016387) : \"\u20ac100 million investment enables co-development of eco-friendly vans and other products for logistics, on-demand ride-hailing, and shuttle service companies.\" \nThe target area of the Arrival partnership is on commercial vehicles (delivery vans, shuttles) as opposed to consumer vehicles that Apple will likely target.\n\nFrom Rimac article [Link]( https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2772): \"Hyundai Motor Group and Rimac Automobili (Rimac) have announced a strategic partnership aimed to strengthen the Group\u2019s efforts to lead the high-performance electrified vehicle market and enhance its status as a game changer in Clean Mobility.\"\nThe target area of the Rimac partnership is high performance, sports concept vehicles also unlikely to be Apple's target market. \n\nAnother piece of potential evidence is from Canoo's investor presentation [Link](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_270955872.png). The picture mentions a project in progress with a Tech Strategic who is \"a player in smart car and autonomous vehicle that has identified Canoo as a base platform to integrate systems.\"\n\nThere is also plenty of history behind Apple and the Canoo founders to explain why this speculation is actually fairly reasonable thinking. In 2015, Apple was very close to using the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car [Link](https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-innovation/apple-bmw-i3-electric-car-173344/amp). This deal fell apart, but it shows that Apple was impressed by the BMW i team's EV platform.
