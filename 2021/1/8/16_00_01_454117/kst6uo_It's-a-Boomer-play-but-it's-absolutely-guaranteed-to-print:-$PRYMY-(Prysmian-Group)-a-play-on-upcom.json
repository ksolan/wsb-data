{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "I am amending my post two weeks advocating for $GE leaps in order to take advantage of upcoming electrical grid upgrades. I talked to a ton of people, spent two weeks doing nonstop reading, am **narrowing the play to the Prysmian Group ($PRYMY, an ADR**). Please see an amended DD below. **This DD isn't TA.** It is a series of political, market, and energy trend facts/assumptions, within the technical realities of grid management. \n\n* **WARNING**: this post is long. By necessity, one has to flesh out linear chains of reasoning in long form. I'll give you the one-paragraph **TLDR** at the end. No rockets. \n* **Context:** This is a 10 bagger play but it'll take time, possibly 2-3 years. There aren't any options available for this. Prysmian is guaranteed to print, but slowly, but it is literally guaranteed to print. It think it'll double by EOY at least. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow is a series of **linear** chain of reasoning with known facts that lead to an outcome that is guaranteed but not priced in. The market isn't carrying the implications of known-trends to their logical conclusion (the material provider--Prysmian) and is currently undervaluing Prysmian Group. Imagine this as a chain of dominos. I will lay each one down consecutively, showing a near-future reality in which a company is set to quintuple if not 10x it's revenue over the next 10 years. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **EVs are going to see mass adoption**. Every automaker + Apple is trying to get in on this. BEV advantages are simply too great. It is highly likely that by 2025, 25-35% or more of new car sales will be electric. This will only continue to 2030. The average car life is [12 years](https://www.aarp.org/auto/trends-lifestyle/info-2018/how-long-do-cars-last.html#:~:text=A%20typical%20passenger%20car%20should,Lyman%2C%20chief%20analyst%20at%20TrueCar). It is likely that by 2033-2035, a majority of U.S cars are electric. \n2. **This will cause big increases in demand on the grid**. [This](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/12/f69/GITT%20ISATT%20EVs%20at%20Scale%20Grid%20Summary%20Report%20FINAL%20Nov2019.pdf) **is a fantastic read--the \"high\" (EV adoption) scenario doesn't show 90% EVs till 2040...which smaller than what is currently happening with new EV models / State/Country bans on ICE vehicles**. The average American home uses \\~33 kWh of energy per day. I own a model 3 (75kWh battery), BARELY drive (no commute) and still charge 6-7 times a month (from 20% to 80%), averaging around 13 kWh per day.  A commuter may use around 30-35 kWh per day just to drive, especially when heating the car. **For a non-commuter thats a 30-40% increase, for a daily commuter that's almost a 100% increase.** By 2025, if \\~30% of the U.S. fleet is electric, that'll cause a significant increase in grid demand. More important, though, is that energy generation planning, permitting, and construction takes a long time. They have to front run this big time because generation facilities (wind/solar) take time to plan, permit, build, and hook-in (HVDC). We're already seeing an absolute renaissance in wind and its only going to keep accelerating along with the EV adoption curve. \n   1. (2B) Additionally, there are other factors behind growing grid demand: California is considering banning gas heating in new homes (Electric heating and anti-gas legislation will increase electric demand for thermal units), an increased interest in hydrogen (via electrosis, for aviation / industry)\n   2. (2C) Some people think that added capacity will be curtailed because everyone will charge at night where there is bandwidth for capacity boosts from existing generation facilities. **These people are wrong**. While night-charging will *assuage* total added generation capacity requirements, there isn't enough current night (natural gas) generation capacity to meet the demand of 40-50% EVs, and (see below) its unlikely Natural Gas is gonna keep as fast as it has been, for political reasons. Additionally (1) Not everyone is going to have home charging (apartment buildings, street parking rowhomes) and thus will supercharge at work/while commuting, (2) many people aren't that disciplined to save $3-4 on a charge, (3) people will live their lives normally--charging when they need, often during the day. **A ton of added capacity is needed.** \n3. **Added capacity is likely to be green**. As of yesterday, /r/Energy had an [article](https://renewablesnow.com/news/renewables-make-71-of-new-us-power-capacity-in-11-mo-2020-727014/) showing how 71% of the added energy (8000mW wind, 6500mW solar) capacity in 2020 was renewables. This phenomenon has two causes. **(1)** Finance: Coal isn't cost competitive with solar and wind anymore. Solar is getting very, very cheap and more and more efficient. Offshore wind is having a renaissance. Nuclear is greener, but more expensive (\\~$4,200 per kW), and NIMBYism will prevail. Solar/wind is FAR cheaper than $4,200 per kW right now. Banks are scared of liberals: Alaskan oil can't even get bank financing now (Just this week, Trump opened up those Alaskan areas for bidding and nobody bidded, literally), and Coal isn't expanding. People see the end of oil (and, honestly, nuclear) is near. **(2)** Politics. Dem administration for the next 4 years, and green energy isn't the political football it was 10 years ago. Fighting renewables isn't the focus of the right anymore. Additionally, Democrats resist natural gas expansion (as noted above). Natural gas isn't that green (big methane problems) and while it's cheap af, its not everywhere (pipeline limits), and I deem it unlikely that population centers (NE Corridor, Cali, Chicago, etc etc), which are ALL liberal, are going to be OK with more and more natural gas plants. I deem it unlikely that we're gonna be a 50%+ natural gas country. Don't believe me? Go read up on California banning natural gas. Yea, Cali can be crazy, but it is almost ALWAYS the harbinger of progressive thinking. Expect that to carry forward. \n4. **Biden will do an infrastructure bill**. This will happen. Its popular, its needed, and its perfect for his huge desire to be seen as a bipartisan president. Its an amazing kick off to his first year in office. He needs to find a way to boost employment before 2022 in order to have a growth-narrative for the midterms. 2022 midterms don't look good for democrats, and if he doesn't have a strong 2021 year (or at least, optically) he'll get lame ducked in 2023-2024. He's not running in 2024, he's too fucking old. So, how does he go into the twilight of his career with the narrative of a 'Unifier'? He does something everyone can get behind: infrastructure. With the recent Trump supporter capital storming, Biden has some great political bandwidth to hit the ground running. \n5. **Biden will try and include moderate green elements in this bill because he knows he won't get green policies otherwise**. Even with the two blue Georgia seats, there is \\*\\*ZERO\\*\\* chance the Dems blow the filibuster. You have (1) a president that won by a narrow margin, that (2) isn't that popular, (3) who has a bad-looking 2022 midterm, that (4) won't run in 2024 cause he's ancient, with (5) a not-too-popular VP, can't afford to run roughshod over norms and weaken their 2022 prospects. No-filibuster 50-50 plus Kamala casting the deciding vote? Please. Not happening. Yet, Biden does need to cater to his liberal supporters and fire up the DNC base in 2022. A great way to get people onboard is to blend an infrastructure bill with elements of the Green New Deal. He has to do this. Its the only way to sneak green policies into implementation to cater to the Left. Standalone 'Green New Deal' isn't happening and McConnell isn't going to let something named that pass, but may let green elements be sluffed into a general infrastructure bill. All this aside, infrastructure is *NEEDED.* Everyone and their mother knows this. It's pushing on an open door, at precisely the right time. \n6. **Green elements in an infrastructure bill will have to benefit Red states** in order to get passed. We're not gonna get a carbon tax / cap and trade system. We're not gonna get massive oil taxes. Yeah, he'll help EV adoption, but that's pretty limited to subsidies (the $7,500 subsidy expansion for Tesla and GM just failed as a line item) and research subsidies. Not good enough for the Left. \n7. **A lot of Red states are RICH in renewables**. Look at the maps below for for U.S. solar and Wind geographic advantages. What do you notice? For the most part, there are huge wind opportunities in the Midwest, Great Lakes, and NE Offshore region. There is huge solar potential across Texas and the South. Outside of California and Northeast Corridor/Great Lakes offshore wind, renewables are concentrated in the Midwest and South. **If you want to do a Green Energy bill that also serves as a bipartisan stimulus, there are geographic comparative advantages that give you a compelling reason to create green energy in Red states.** \n\n[Solar Irradiance Map \\(2018\\)](https://preview.redd.it/uilz3fxoc0a61.jpg?width=5101&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25925051c0038ace93d3cd47392b88a231f1af0c)\n\n[Wind Power Map--Note the Great Lakes, Midwest, and NE Corridor Offshore](https://preview.redd.it/dwhto5huc0a61.png?width=1087&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f5b15711a5dbf1ee5454007d153d0504dad168a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**However, the Grid currently isn't configured to transport the level of green energy needed to meet the heightened demand environment in 2030-2040. Guess what links huge solar fields and onshore/offshore wind to population centers? HVDC does. The HVDC network to pipe \"local\" (regional) renewable hotspots to population centers doesn't exist. See the below map of the U.S. HVDC Grid, and compare it to Europe and China's:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g5cn24w2h0a61.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fcd18d57aea8a5ad24b080d9f5dc6e77e48d34a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Note all the Offshore Wind to the North Sea, and the connections between Renewable hot spots \\(Iceland, etc\\) to population centers](https://i.redd.it/hmijqzkxh0a61.gif)\n\n[This won't be surprising. The Chinese do big infrastructure, and half the Party back in the 90s were hydrologic engineers. ](https://preview.redd.it/9ycsi1d5i0a61.jpg?width=1240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fafd25e782fbd27964d1b1f958e80ea46fc855d6)\n\nIn addition to these maps, look at the [**global list of HVDC projects Wikipedia page**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HVDC_projects)**. Observe how many are in Asia/Euro vs the U.S.** It's not our fault, in the past grid owners could easily locate generation facilities near enough to minimize high voltage lines. However, things are changing--wind and solar take space, aren't as location-independent as gas/coal/nuclear. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* (8) **Microgrids won't solve the issue.** Obviously Tesla city-level distributed powerpacks will happen, but this isn't an either-or situation. **The speed of EV adoption and the heightened demand environment are going to vastly outpace the adoption of rooftop solar (what many microgrid proponents suggest can fully-deal with grid demand)**. Grid-level wind/solar is still needed, and those sources need to be connected in, so again, a regionalized HVDC connection system from renewable --> population center is still needed. \n* (9) **The more HVDC connections that are installed, the more compelling it will be to form longer-linkages (more HVDC) between population centers (and therefore, storage).** Connected regional grids (think--Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania connected mutually via Great Lakes Wind farms that are, in turn, connected to the NE Corridor) marginally decrease the amount of total net storage needed in the system, as \"the wind is always blowing/sun is always shining somewhere\". This process will continue until we eventually have a 'Supergrid'--but NOT one by original purpose--which is what people usually argue against when people mention that word, but convenience--alongside thousands of microgrids. \n   * If this seems extreme to you, sit back, consider the 2nd point of this post, then imagine 80% of Cars are EVs within 15 years. A vast majority of Semi-trucks are electric. Advances in batteries mean that Planes, shipping, and tons of military applications now all use huge amounts of power. Grid demand is way, WAY higher than it was when the biggest demand source were light bulbs and your shitty AC unit. \n* (10) **The way to play this is by going to the manufacturer / installer**. **Prysmian Group ($PRYMY, an ADR) is the largest HVDC provider in the world. It's also a pure play.** It is based in Milan, but its a union of 3 companies--one of which is General Cable (American), which produces HVDC domestically. See the below image, which is from Prysmian's 2019 annual report. The green dots are energy cable (HVDC) manufacturing facilities. See a trend? They're almost all in Red states (again--renewables largely in Red States, HVDC manufacturing in Red states...)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m5vyb46so0a61.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=202e61a596fcac6e73c1584e3a5eeec9059dec58\n\n* (11) **45% of Prysmian's revenue is Grid work. It has a P/E of 44. What happens when Prysmian's revenue goes up by 3x over the next 5 years, and 10x by 2030?** There is SO much work to be done modernizing the U.S. grid, but then on to the rest of the world. The realities I am describing--EVs--> heightened demand --> green is cheap --> it needs to be hooked in --> regional grid connections lower net amount of storage needed in aggregate, etc etc etc, aren't unique to the first world. Other countries will follow suit. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nI do not believe this reality is baked into the price. Although everyone knows grid upgrades are coming (hence 44 P/E), I don't think that people are taking these large-phenomenon down to their lower level logical-conclusions. The gradual, inadvertent development of the Supergrid is inevitable, necessary, and politically convenient for a guy so desperate to bridge the political divide. Prysmian is well suited to take full advantage of American infrastructure as well as the rest of the world. \n\n\\------------------\n\nTL/DR:\n\n**EVs adoption curves are getting faster and faster, and are going to drive higher electrical demands from the Grid, which will be met with Green Energy. This will require a huge increase in HVDC installations. This is occurring at exactly the time Biden needs a big infrastructure plan for political-economic reasons, and the realities of Green energy in the U.S. actually benefit Red States pretty bigly. Gradually, HVDC networks will reach a point where a macro-regional 'Supergrids' become a reality (in order to lower aggregate storage requirements and add more safety/redundancy). $PRYMY (Prysmian Group) is the worlds largest HVDC provider and they manufacture HVDC in the U.S. They are primed to benefit from this trend, and it is currently vastly undervalued.** \n\nSorry no rockets.

advocating for $GE leaps in order to take advantage of upcoming electrical grid upgrades. I talked to a ton of people, spent two weeks doing nonstop reading, am <strong>narrowing the play to the Prysmian Group ($PRYMY, an ADR</strong>). Please see an amended DD below. <strong>This DD isn&#39;t TA.</strong> It is a series of political, market, and energy trend facts/assumptions, within the technical realities of grid management. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WARNING</strong>: this post is long.

The market isn&#39;t carrying the implications of known-trends to their logical conclusion (the material provider--Prysmian) and is currently undervaluing Prysmian Group. Imagine this as a chain of dominos. I will lay each one down consecutively, showing a near-future reality in which a company is set to quintuple if not 10x it&#39;s revenue over the next 10 years. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>EVs are going to see mass adoption</strong>. Every automaker + Apple is trying to get in on this. BEV advantages are simply too great. It is highly likely that by 2025, 25-35% or more of new car sales will be electric. This will only continue to 2030. The average car life is <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/auto/trends-lifestyle/info-2018/how-long-do-cars-last.html#:%7E:text=A%20typical%20passenger%20car%20should,Lyman%2C%20chief%20analyst%20at%20TrueCar\">12 years</a>. It is likely that by 2033-2035, a majority of U.S cars are electric. </li>\n<li><strong>This will cause big increases in demand on the grid</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/12/f69/GITT%20ISATT%20EVs%20at%20Scale%20Grid%20Summary%20Report%20FINAL%20Nov2019.pdf\">This</a> <strong>is a fantastic read--the &quot;high&quot; (EV adoption) scenario doesn&#39;t show 90% EVs till 2040...which smaller than what is currently happening with new EV models / State/Country bans on ICE vehicles</strong>. The average American home uses ~33 kWh of energy per day. I own a model 3 (75kWh battery), BARELY drive (no commute) and still charge 6-7 times a month (from 20% to 80%), averaging around 13 kWh per day.  A commuter may use around 30-35 kWh per day just to drive, especially when heating the car. <strong>For a non-commuter thats a 30-40% increase, for a daily commuter that&#39;s almost a 100% increase.</strong> By 2025, if ~30% of the U.S. fleet is electric, that&#39;ll cause a significant increase in grid demand. More important, though, is that energy generation planning, permitting, and construction takes a long time. They have to front run this big time because generation facilities (wind/solar) take time to plan, permit, build, and hook-in (HVDC). We&#39;re already seeing an absolute renaissance in wind and its only going to keep accelerating along with the EV adoption curve. \n\n<ol>\n<li>(2B) Additionally, there are other factors behind growing grid demand: California is considering banning gas heating in new homes (Electric heating and anti-gas legislation will increase electric demand for thermal units), an increased interest in hydrogen (via electrosis, for aviation / industry)</li>\n<li>(2C) Some people think that added capacity will be curtailed because everyone will charge at night where there is bandwidth for capacity boosts from existing generation facilities. <strong>These people are wrong</strong>. While night-charging will <em>assuage</em> total added generation capacity requirements, there isn&#39;t enough current night (natural gas) generation capacity to meet the demand of 40-50% EVs, and (see below) its unlikely Natural Gas is gonna keep as fast as it has been, for political reasons. Additionally (1) Not everyone is going to have home charging (apartment buildings, street parking rowhomes) and thus will supercharge at work/while commuting, (2) many people aren&#39;t that disciplined to save $3-4 on a charge, (3) people will live their lives normally--charging when they need, often during the day. <strong>A ton of added capacity is needed.</strong> </li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><strong>Added capacity is likely to be green</strong>. As of yesterday, <a href=\"/r/Energy\">/r/Energy</a> had an <a href=\"https://renewablesnow.com/news/renewables-make-71-of-new-us-power-capacity-in-11-mo-2020-727014/\">article</a> showing how 71% of the added energy (8000mW wind, 6500mW solar) capacity in 2020 was renewables. This phenomenon has two causes. <strong>(1)</strong> Finance: Coal isn&#39;t cost competitive with solar and wind anymore. Solar is getting very, very cheap and more and more efficient. Offshore wind is having a renaissance. Nuclear is greener, but more expensive (~$4,200 per kW), and NIMBYism will prevail. Solar/wind is FAR cheaper than $4,200 per kW right now. Banks are scared of liberals: Alaskan oil can&#39;t even get bank financing now (Just this week, Trump opened up those Alaskan areas for bidding and nobody bidded, literally), and Coal isn&#39;t expanding. People see the end of oil (and, honestly, nuclear) is near. <strong>(2)</strong> Politics. Dem administration for the next 4 years, and green energy isn&#39;t the political football it was 10 years ago. Fighting renewables isn&#39;t the focus of the right anymore. Additionally, Democrats resist natural gas expansion (as noted above). Natural gas isn&#39;t that green (big methane problems) and while it&#39;s cheap af, its not everywhere (pipeline limits), and I deem it unlikely that population centers (NE Corridor, Cali, Chicago, etc etc), which are ALL liberal, are going to be OK with more and more natural gas plants. I deem it unlikely that we&#39;re gonna be a 50%+ natural gas country. Don&#39;t believe me? Go read up on California banning natural gas. Yea, Cali can be crazy, but it is almost ALWAYS the harbinger of progressive thinking. Expect that to carry forward. </li>\n<li><strong>Biden will do an infrastructure bill</strong>. This will happen. Its popular, its needed, and its perfect for his huge desire to be seen as a bipartisan president. Its an amazing kick off to his first year in office. He needs to find a way to boost employment before 2022 in order to have a growth-narrative for the midterms. 2022 midterms don&#39;t look good for democrats, and if he doesn&#39;t have a strong 2021 year (or at least, optically) he&#39;ll get lame ducked in 2023-2024. He&#39;s not running in 2024, he&#39;s too fucking old. So, how does he go into the twilight of his career with the narrative of a &#39;Unifier&#39;? He does something everyone can get behind: infrastructure. With the recent Trump supporter capital storming, Biden has some great political bandwidth to hit the ground running. </li>\n<li><strong>Biden will try and include moderate green elements in this bill because he knows he won&#39;t get green policies otherwise</strong>. Even with the two blue Georgia seats, there is **ZERO** chance the Dems blow the filibuster. You have (1) a president that won by a narrow margin, that (2) isn&#39;t that popular, (3) who has a bad-looking 2022 midterm, that (4) won&#39;t run in 2024 cause he&#39;s ancient, with (5) a not-too-popular VP, can&#39;t afford to run roughshod over norms and weaken their 2022 prospects. No-filibuster 50-50 plus Kamala casting the deciding vote? Please. Not happening. Yet, Biden does need to cater to his liberal supporters and fire up the DNC base in 2022. A great way to get people onboard is to blend an infrastructure bill with elements of the Green New Deal. He has to do this. Its the only way to sneak green policies into implementation to cater to the Left. Standalone &#39;Green New Deal&#39; isn&#39;t happening and McConnell isn&#39;t going to let something named that pass, but may let green elements be sluffed into a general infrastructure bill. All this aside, infrastructure is <em>NEEDED.</em> Everyone and their mother knows this. It&#39;s pushing on an open door, at precisely the right time. </li>\n<li><strong>Green elements in an infrastructure bill will have to benefit Red states</strong> in order to get passed. We&#39;re not gonna get a carbon tax / cap and trade system. We&#39;re not gonna get massive oil taxes. Yeah, he&#39;ll help EV adoption, but that&#39;s pretty limited to subsidies (the $7,500 subsidy expansion for Tesla and GM just failed as a line item) and research subsidies. Not good enough for the Left. </li>\n<li><strong>A lot of Red states are RICH in renewables</strong>. Look at the maps below for for U.S. solar and Wind geographic advantages. What do you notice? For the most part, there are huge wind opportunities in the Midwest, Great Lakes, and NE Offshore region. There is huge solar potential across Texas and the South. Outside of California and Northeast Corridor/Great Lakes offshore wind, renewables are concentrated in the Midwest and South. <strong>If you want to do a Green Energy bill that also serves as a bipartisan stimulus, there are geographic comparative advantages that give you a compelling reason to create green energy in Red states.</strong> </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uilz3fxoc0a61.jpg?width=5101&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25925051c0038ace93d3cd47392b88a231f1af0c\">Solar Irradiance Map (2018)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dwhto5huc0a61.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f5b15711a5dbf1ee5454007d153d0504dad168a\">Wind Power Map--Note the Great Lakes, Midwest, and NE Corridor Offshore</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>However, the Grid currently isn&#39;t configured to transport the level of green energy needed to meet the heightened demand environment in 2030-2040. Guess what links huge solar fields and onshore/offshore wind to population centers? HVDC does. The HVDC network to pipe &quot;local&quot; (regional) renewable hotspots to population centers doesn&#39;t exist. See the below map of the U.S. HVDC Grid, and compare it to Europe and China&#39;s:</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/g5cn24w2h0a61.png?width=560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fcd18d57aea8a5ad24b080d9f5dc6e77e48d34a\">https://preview.redd.it/g5cn24w2h0a61.png?width=560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fcd18d57aea8a5ad24b080d9f5dc6e77e48d34a</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/hmijqzkxh0a61.gif\">Note all the Offshore Wind to the North Sea, and the connections between Renewable hot spots (Iceland, etc) to population centers</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9ycsi1d5i0a61.jpg?width=1240&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fafd25e782fbd27964d1b1f958e80ea46fc855d6\">This won&#39;t be surprising. The Chinese do big infrastructure, and half the Party back in the 90s were hydrologic engineers. </a></p>\n\n<p>In addition to these maps, look at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HVDC_projects\"><strong>global list of HVDC projects Wikipedia page</strong></a><strong>. Observe how many are in Asia/Euro vs the U.S.</strong> It&#39;s not our fault, in the past grid owners could easily locate generation facilities near enough to minimize high voltage lines. However, things are changing--wind and solar take space, aren&#39;t as location-independent as gas/coal/nuclear. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>(8) <strong>Microgrids won&#39;t solve the issue.</strong> Obviously Tesla city-level distributed powerpacks will happen, but this isn&#39;t an either-or situation. <strong>The speed of EV adoption and the heightened demand environment are going to vastly outpace the adoption of rooftop solar (what many microgrid proponents suggest can fully-deal with grid demand)</strong>. Grid-level wind/solar is still needed, and those sources need to be connected in, so again, a regionalized HVDC connection system from renewable --&gt; population center is still needed. </li>\n<li>(9) <strong>The more HVDC connections that are installed, the more compelling it will be to form longer-linkages (more HVDC) between population centers (and therefore, storage).</strong> Connected regional grids (think--Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania connected mutually via Great Lakes Wind farms that are, in turn, connected to the NE Corridor) marginally decrease the amount of total net storage needed in the system, as &quot;the wind is always blowing/sun is always shining somewhere&quot;. This process will continue until we eventually have a &#39;Supergrid&#39;--but NOT one by original purpose--which is what people usually argue against when people mention that word, but convenience--alongside thousands of microgrids. \n\n<ul>\n<li>If this seems extreme to you, sit back, consider the 2nd point of this post, then imagine 80% of Cars are EVs within 15 years. A vast majority of Semi-trucks are electric. Advances in batteries mean that Planes, shipping, and tons of military applications now all use huge amounts of power. Grid demand is way, WAY higher than it was when the biggest demand source were light bulbs and your shitty AC unit. </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>(10) <strong>The way to play this is by going to the manufacturer / installer</strong>. <strong>Prysmian Group ($PRYMY, an ADR) is the largest HVDC provider in the world. It&#39;s also a pure play.</strong> It is based in Milan, but its a union of 3 companies--one of which is General Cable (American), which produces HVDC domestically. See the below image, which is from Prysmian&#39;s 2019 annual report. The green dots are energy cable (HVDC) manufacturing facilities. See a trend? They&#39;re almost all in Red states (again--renewables largely in Red States, HVDC manufacturing in Red states...)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/m5vyb46so0a61.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=202e61a596fcac6e73c1584e3a5eeec9059dec58\">https://preview.redd.it/m5vyb46so0a61.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=202e61a596fcac6e73c1584e3a5eeec9059dec58</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>(11) <strong>45% of Prysmian&#39;s revenue is Grid work. It has a P/E of 44. What happens when Prysmian&#39;s revenue goes up by 3x over the next 5 years, and 10x by 2030?</strong> There is SO much work to be done modernizing the U.S. grid, but then on to the rest of the world. The realities I am describing--EVs--&gt; heightened demand --&gt; green is cheap --&gt; it needs to be hooked in --&gt; regional grid connections lower net amount of storage needed in aggregate, etc etc etc, aren&#39;t unique to the first world. Other countries will follow suit. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>I do not believe this reality is baked into the price. Although everyone knows grid upgrades are coming (hence 44 P/E), I don&#39;t think that people are taking these large-phenomenon down to their lower level logical-conclusions. The gradual, inadvertent development of the Supergrid is inevitable, necessary, and politically convenient for a guy so desperate to bridge the political divide. Prysmian is well suited to take full advantage of American infrastructure as well as the rest of the world. </p>\n\n<p>------------------</p>\n\n<p>TL/DR:</p>\n\n<p><strong>EVs adoption curves are getting faster and faster, and are going to drive higher electrical demands from the Grid, which will be met with Green Energy. This will require a huge increase in HVDC installations. This is occurring at exactly the time Biden needs a big infrastructure plan for political-economic reasons, and the realities of Green energy in the U.S. actually benefit Red States pretty bigly. Gradually, HVDC networks will reach a point where a macro-regional &#39;Supergrids&#39; become a reality (in order to lower aggregate storage requirements and add more safety/redundancy). $PRYMY (Prysmian Group) is the worlds largest HVDC provider and they manufacture HVDC in the U.S. They are primed to benefit from this trend, and it is currently vastly undervalued.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Sorry no rockets.
