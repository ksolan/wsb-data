{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "* Elon chan has supplanted Bezos as the richest bro in the universe. This makes all quants who kept yapping about how TSLA pricing action via option gamma squeeze will subside once it's included in S&P screech in horror. Who knew the meme stock can continue its action unabated? TSLA hits ATH almost everyday this week, closing Friday up 7.84% to $880. Unreal.\n\n* For a succinct difference of Elon chan's prowess vs Bezos, refer to chart below:\n\nElon | Bezos |\n:---------|:----------|\nHot [goth gf](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3a/f1/d6/3af1d61d443906cb37f5ef92d34412b1.png) who will do kinky shit for him | Traded hot milf for botox lady so he can have dirty shit done to him |\nRegularly flies astronauts to the fucking space station with his rockets that can fucking land themselves | Have to keep selling AMZN shares to fund his shit space company that's still dicking around with suborbital flight |\nTalks about new gigafactory and everyone wants to give him sick tax breaks to build in their city/state | Shops for new second HQ to give high paying white collar jobs but AOC and gang gets up on his ass in asking for tax breaks |\n\n* Morning economic numbers: nonfarm payrolls once again looking terrible, with consensus at about 50k increase but instead saw a -140k Dec. This ends a 7-month streak of steady gains in recovery. No worry fam, if you've lived thru March 2020 lows you'll know that market doesn't give a fuck about employment #s until you go all-in on calls. US reports more than 4k covid deaths for the first time ever - refer to above on why market doesn't give a fuck.\n\n* Flurries of behind-the-scene political actions are happening as the country moves on from Y'all Qaeda's storming of the capitol. A number of high-level admin officials from policy advisors to cabinet members have bailed the sinking ship that is this current administration. Chatters of invoking 25th amendment. Second impeachment. POTUS has stated that he will NOT attend the upcoming inauguration (who knew he's a gdamn snowflake?), after finally putting out a statement that an orderly transition will occur. \n\n* Psuedo-SJW social media companies and platforms have banned POTUS in tandem, conveniently doing so after the Dems have clinched both chambers of Congress and will likely sit on committees regulating them. No real movements from these actions yet, though TWTR is pulling back after it banned POTUS for 12 hours until he deleted the offending Tweet. TWTR closed the day down -1.62% to $51.48, after an intraday low of more than -2%.\n\n* BA got a slap on the wrist with a 2.5 bil fine from the DOJ for killing non-Americans. About 10% of the fine goes to the US govt while about 500 mil goes to the families of the 346 people that died in the two 737 Max crash. Remaining (70%) amount goes to BA customers because let's face it, corporations are truly the ones really hurting. BA closed down -1.32% to $209.\n\n* It's a solid day for many Chinese ADRs as as BABA and TCEHY escape Treasury's list of delisting stonk. BABA closed up 4% for the day at $236 while TCEHY closed up 5.61% to $76.89. NIO, the TSLA of China (or is it XPEV? or LI? find out in 1.5 years!) closed up big at 8.55% to almost $59, despite offering to sell 68m more shares last month at $39. Surely the US market isn't going to be China Hustled.\n\n* Today's big movers: DDD and PLUG continues their wild rocket moves to the stratosphere as strong market sentiment continues. DDD closed up 2.48% to $23.54, after touching an intraday high of almost 10% earlier. PLUG closed up 13% to $53.78.\n\n* PSTH, Ackman's brainchild SPAC flew almost 12% today on ZERO news but faded towards end of the day. PSTH gang collectively jizzed and made a mess of themselves. Will it be Stripe? (it's not) Chick-fil-A? (it's not) Bloomberg? (eh they sorta denied it) Subway? (please god no). Find out eventually sometime Q1 2021 as Bill continues to edge us. Seriously Bill, announce something amazing already because I'm up more than 20k on zero news and I'm tempted to sell. PSTH closed up 7.24% to $29.32.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, a new law is being formed where none of these gdamn stock can go up together on the same day. PLTR faded to flat of 0.80% after being up more than 3% during early mornings, whereas GME and MT both fade some more today after a decent run-up attempt this entire week. GME close the day down -2.16% to $17.69, while MT pulls back from a week's worth of solid gain at -2.7% to $24.83. WSB's new meme ETF ICLN had some profit taking happened much to the displeasure of people who fomo into the ETF this morning, not realizing the sea of red candles were not bullish indicators. ICLN close the day down slightly to -0.75% to $33.15. Funny enough, OTM monthly calls haven't pulled back that much due to the magic of IV.\n\n* While initially red through out most of the day, the DOW reversed course and closed up 0.18% or 56 pts, S&P up 0.55% or 20 pts, Nasdaq up a solid 1% or 134 pts, and RUT closed flat at -0.25% or -5 pts. It's the weekend and WSB newcomers addicted to FDs will no doubt flood the weekend thread, constantly asking if their $700 portfolio (funded in part by the $600 stimulus) with OTM calls will be okay. Don't worry new fam, stonk only goes up.\n\n(Yesterday's recap: none cuz I was lazy and enjoying gains.
