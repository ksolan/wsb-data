{"approved_at_utc": null, "selftext": "To understand how stocks move, first, you gotta understand the interaction between buyers and sellers. Basically, it's Econ-101 supply and demand. Too much demand? Buyers will have to raise their prices so that sellers sell.\n\nSecond, the types of market participants. Active and passive participants.\n\nPassive participants are like, buy buy sell buy sell buy sell buy buy buy sell buy sell sell buy. This is almost completely automated and determined by the weighting of the stock versus the index or the methodology that it is following.\n\nThe bots of VOO, for example, don't give a damn if an accounting scandal has happened or if a new breakthrough has been reached. Every day, it will buy and sell stocks indiscriminately, following the algos.\n\nAnd increasingly, newer assets under management are coming mostly under those passive investment vehicles such as passive ETFs, passive mutual funds etc leading to them having a larger and larger share of the market. (I am coming to active participants later)\n\nThirdly, you gotta understand hedging. Which is basically an investment position to offset losses. Example, you sell a naked call. You see the stock moving closer to the strike price. You immediately buy shares to ensure that you don't take a loss.\n\n# Ok, now why do individual stocks move?\n\nThey move based on events (plain old news, market-related movements etc). Now, let's go back to active participants such as retail investors, hedge funds, fund managers etc.\n\nSuppose, there's a quarterly earnings report coming out for ASML. Almost all active participants have somehow figured from various news reports that the earnings report will be good because of the huge demand for ASML's product.\n\nAs a result, an active fund manager takes a big position on that stock. The stock moves a bit. Hedge funds and other firms also take their positions.\n\nA retard post about the company's upcoming good earnings on the internet and all early retard investors quickly get in.\n\nThe stock moves up. In the meantime, the passive funds are adjusting their position in the stock, realtime. If it's going up. They are buying more to adjust their position.\n\nNow, don't forget. Those passive ETFs or funds have other semiconductor stocks in their ETFs and shits. Which means, even if only ASMLs quarterly earnings were supposed to be good, other stocks of the same sector will benefit. As there are tons of both active and passive algos that don't trade individual stocks but ETFs and similar stuff due to liquidity reasons or other reasons.\n\nEdit: for clarification, this is not the only type of passive investment ETFs. In fact, some will sell if the stock rises.\n\nThis gets even better. Suppose, lots of retail investors are also buying call options of this stock. If the underlying continues to go up, the delta could keep on rising. Suppose it went from 5% to 10% to 20%. This would force the option sellers to keep on buying more and more shares and could lead to gamma explosion where the market makers create a violent feedback loop due to hedging.\n\nIt gets more fun than that. Remember the various HFT firms and scalper bots? Well, they know it all too well that some firms are busy at hedging frenzy. They also join in on the feeding frenzy that is this stock.\n\nAfter said earnings release(or most likely, just before it), most of the active participants like retail traders and hedge funds may well start taking profits. And the stock generally runs up more than the expected in the first place.\n\nThis leads to the violent unwinding of the positions that we generally see after the earnings release. Because everything happens in the exact reverse order I just described here. That's why it's a terrible gamble to buy options in hope of a good earnings release or similar news.\n\nIt feels euphoric if you are on the right side of the tide and equally depressing if you are on the wrong side of the tide.\n\nThe same thing can happen in the opposite direction if a piece of bad news is expected or happens.\n\nHere, earnings release is just one of the events that I described. It could be any event like index inclusion, regulatory shifts, stock splits, analyst upgrade-downgrades, some fund manager or hedge funds buying the stock etc.\n\nAlso, don't forget that all this is also affecting other stocks in the same sector/region etc due to them being connected through passive investments and active participants exploiting the passive participants.\n\nA very recent example of this happening would be the stock PLTR. Remember, they signed a contract with FDA for $44M but the stock moved almost $10B or more(I haven't calculated) or about 20%. Two weeks ago maybe, Citron declared short attack and a violent unwinding of positions happened and the stock went down about 15-20% after climbing 10-12% that day. Or the day before that when it climbed 20%+.\n\nNow I have sold calls on PLTR (yeah, I like it that your 12/04, 12/11, 12/18 expired or will expire worthless).\n\n**This is not how all stocks move.**\n\nBut a large portion of the stocks that are mentioned here in the sub move this way. This is why it sometimes feels like to you folks as KINDA pump and dump. But whether you retards accept it or not I know you guys are the cream of the crop. While most of you act as if you know nothing, I know very well most of you probably make money.\n\nYou guys are like people who watch tech reviews to buy a smartphone.\n\nOk, I completely went out of topic. Sorry.\n\n**This is not how all stocks move.**\n\nSome boomer stocks like MMM, JBT etc may have low retail interest. In those cases, the stocks are almost absolutely up to the mercy of other active participants, who or which may as well not care that much leaving those stocks to the hands of the algos of passive participants.\n\nBut in those whole processes, there's almost no price discovery that's actually working. Passive algos are buying and selling (but mostly creating buying pressure) completely arbitrarily, HFT bots buying and selling because, reasons.\n\nThe participants who are using traditional valuation metrics, analyzing the good and bad of stocks are getting outnumbered by all the other participants and generally speaking, the volume of their trades are also declining in the overall market. Think of big participants like Berkshire(which is undoubtedly the most powerful active participant in the market), pension funds, sovereign funds etc, they barely buy or sell any stocks they have if they have entered on the right price.\n\nSure, I am kinda underselling the influence of big institutional investors, but it is not completely without any merit.\n\n**So you are saying there's no price discovery in the various stocks?**\n\nAbsolutely not. Even in the greatly flawed system I described being used by most market participants there's plenty of it happening by newsflashes, sell-side analyst recommendations, retail fomoers etc.\n\nOnly the stocks that have heavy institutional ownerships, with a healthy retail interest seems to me to be less volatile(this is my intuition speaking really, so this statement is probably false in the first place) such as MSFT etc and they probably have better price discovery.\n\n**What about those stocks doubling the day they IPO?**\n\nThe reason behind that is very simple. Tons of retail investors place Market Orders. This means they are ready to pay whatever the price this thing will go for. In those scenarios, investment banks can hardly control the price of the stock as there's just too much demand to satisfy. In short, it's a feeding frenzy. And this is one of the things that's primarily driven by retail interest.\n\n**What about those SPACs and low-float stocks?**\n\nWell, this again needs no explaining. Too low float, too much interest. Various whales also know this and use this for their benefit. After the merger is complete(or slightly before it) retail investors and whales leave for the next thing in the line. So the stock tanks and the stock price never recovers.\n\nIf the company that's being pumped is actually any good, the stock would likely later get the attention it deserves after the sell-off.\n\nI hope all those points are good enough to explain most of the funky behaviour an individual stock would make. I know my explanations are not exhaustive and there are many angles I haven't covered, but it is what it is.\n\nNow, to the MORE IMPORTANT STUFF. Individual stocks also move due to numerous macro reasons. When the entire market is in a euphoric phase, you can throw a dart and that stock would move up. The opposite and the stock would go down.\n\n# Why and how does the market move?\n\nLiquidity. This is probably the most important thing that drives the market as a whole.\n\nExcess liquidity that's circling around will inevitably try to enter into the economy in one way or another. Either through purchasing more assets or any other way.\n\nNow, we all know it pretty well that this trend is being exaggerated by the low-interest-rate environment that's present in the current developed markets. People are being forced to participate in the market in the hunt for return.\n\nAlso, almost every investor from every country seems to be more interested to participate in the US stock market, even more than their home markets. And the recent trend of commission-free brokerage services and easy flow of capital has helped to provide even more participation in the stock market than usual.\n\nOptions trading is also at historic highs and probably most of you buy call options and put options is probably mostly bought by institutional investors(like it always were). As a whole, this frenzy can move the market very quickly.\n\nRemember, SoftBank bought billions in options on very concentrated tech names? That along with retail call options purchasing mania lead the market to a euphoric state. The S&P 500 has become so heavily influenced by those tech names that if they move, the entire market moves. If they fall, the entire market falls.\n\nBut we haven't probably addressed a big elephant in the room. Volatility suppression.\n\nFutures traders, algos, our central bank etc all are participating in the dangerous game of volatility suppression. \n\nThis all can unwind though. And it can unwind fairly quickly.\n\nIf we take the case of February or March. If you remember, Mr Ackman was screaming fire, fire, fire(he have had his intentions) but the market was barely paying attention.\n\nBut with the lockdowns and everything, suddenly everyone seems to have gotten caught with their pants down.\n\nAnd you know how quick all the things were. Active investors, retail investors everyone suddenly flocked for put options, VIX etc. A Minsky moment has suddenly come.\n\nMargin calls, longs are burnt left and right, market makers have completely turned their positions etc, you know the usual deal but exactly in the opposite direction.\n\nSuddenly gold, treasuries, cryptos etc whatever are being sold to cover their positions. Institutional investors are suddenly visited by their risk managements and they suddenly become net sellers.\n\nPassive investments vehicles also sell stocks that are being kicked heavily.\n\nLiterally, everyone's a seller. No one wants to buy. And the situation doesn't change until the Fed comes in and says, \"Brrrr\".\n\nLiquidity suddenly becomes available in the debt market. Retail investors jump. Buy the dip, they said. Money keeps flowing in from everywhere.\n\nThere are many other things that I probably needed to say to complete the story. But it is what it is.\n\nAlso, interest rate trumps over everything. Every valuation metrics, pricing schemes are dependent on it. So that's super important.\n\nLet's say suddenly interest rates rise the market will immediately collapse along with your meme stock. Because of two main reasons. Every company is loaded with debt and the risk free return has just increased resulting in more money chasing treasury bonds and other instruments.\n\n# These pieces of information any useful?\n\nYes and no. As they say, hindsight is always 20/20.\n\nLet me tell you my short story navigating the market this year.\n\nFebruary. News of the virus and everything. I see VIX, S&P, bond market, foreign markets etc and I keep sucking my thumb thinking nothing's going to happen. Being burnt by two trades and market starting to freefall almost. I realize my mistake and change my strategy.\n\nFed says, \"Brrr\". I fail to change my strategy. Something even worse could be coming. Lol. After almost a week passing I realise my f\\*\\*\\*ing mistake. Again. At least I can say it's not just me.\n\nThe information is almost always there. Problem is we(not everyone of course, some of you are much more flexible) fail to act upon it. \n\nOk, one more story about an individual stock.\n\nRemember AAPL's third-quarter earnings result? I sold calls before earnings thinking the stock will go down after earnings report.\n\nThere was overwhelming evidence that this is not going to be true. And I read almost all of it (WFH and everything). Yet my monkey brain somehow decided to trust the analyst estimates and the overall news cycle surrounding the economy.\n\nAAPL then reported a literal blow away quarterly earnings report.\n\nFor me 2020 was a year of reckoning and I learned to remove my directional assumption from the market and to just go with the flow. But I am pretty sure it wouldn't matter, cause when it's time, I just wouldn't remember.\n\nI posted this one before but it got removed by votebots.", "author_fullname": "t2_oco7h7q", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "Why market moves(long)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Discussion"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ktjfsq", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 75, "total_awards_received": 5, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 75, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1610177699.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_2": 1}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610193710.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>To understand how stocks move, first, you gotta understand the interaction between buyers and sellers.
