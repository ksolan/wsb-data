Every orifice we have has been smokefucked relentlessly by Melvin and his circle jerk penises hiding in suits. It hurts, but the bleeding will stop. Now suck it the fuck up. It's time to pack some gauze and toilet paper. Put your helmets and retard safety gear on because Ryan Cohen has us swaddled in his arms.\n\nFor all you raisin brains working your double fast food shifts and lacking the time to watch Ryan Cohen's twitter like the fat kid eyeing the last 5 donuts in your Krispy Kreme box, I have your back.\n\nAs we all know, a great leader doesn't show face 24/7, but they do come around when you are bent over backwards getting pillaged into oblivion by Melvin's STD riddled uvula puncher in a dark alley behind a Waffle House. This time is no different. Our savior Ryan Cohen just told all you dimwit-fell-off-the-shortbus-smooth-brains to strap in for a \"fun ride.\" I went ahead and took a break from half chub jerking off to my friend's TESLA gains to reverse image search this high quality piece of treasure.\n\nMassive Membrane Ryan Cohen took some time out of his day to search roller coaster memes and found this one. We have been instructed to \"keep arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times\". This isn't just some numbing gel to soothe the pain of our torn open and prolapsed assholes. ICR conference is next week and I know some of you weak handed semen squirters hopped on the ride and chickened out at a fucking loss, right before it started. You left your dignity in the same bathroom that you threw your shit-stained underwear. We are gonna go on the ride of a lifetime with enough action that you'll finally have something relatable to tell your wife's boyfriend. It's one that will make your chump pump inflate so explosively that you'll feel a sharp tug on your butthole.\n\nYesterday was everyone but us (and PLTR, sorry guys). Today was Tesla swinging their nuts like vibranium reinforced wrecking balls, knocking every sell wall out like Mike Tyson KO'ing your crippled grandma over the last bit of Chicken Tikka Masala... and everybody else but us again. However, our time to shine is almost upon us. Our balls drop next week and you might even get your first erection. When this rocket starts blasting, you'll go from your first pube to filming your first consensual orgy in record time. (Thanks Melvin for making me point out the sex acts you've forced on us).\n\nFor all you cowards that sold out of GME today and made some money. I am still proud. Either hop back in with more than you had before or go make tendies elsewhere and be prosperous. For you other sperm suckers that sold out of GME today at $17.08 because you have weaker hands than a sleeping quadriplegic, I hope you like giving throat jobs at truck stops for pocket change. Lemme do you a favor, if you sold out of GME at a loss and weren't up EOD, don't hop back in or your toilet paper hands will dissolve as soon as this girl starts getting wet and you'll just lose money all over again.\n\nI know Melvin has done some damage and our assholes move like a blown sub and at this point, probably can't even hold in a fart. It's okay, sometimes making tendies causes grease fires and 3rd degree burns. If you want Melvin out of your guts, you better pull your head out of your own poopchute and throw up a \"Do Not Enter\" sign to prevent future mishaps.\n\nAt this point, I'm more excited to see Melvin capitulate into a ball of wrinkly old man writhing in despair and loss, than I am to see green dildos on my screen. Regardless LOAD UP THE FUCKING ROCKETS AND LIGHT SOME CANDLES BECAUSE IT SMELLS LIKE BITCH IN HERE. IF MELVIN WANTS TO STICK HIS ONE DROP WONDER PLUNGER INTO GME'S CHILI RING, P-UMP IT AND SQUEEZE THAT SHIT CLEAN OFF!!\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAlso, for the last 10 times I tried to post this, it got blocked by some anti-evil bot and I've had to go back through and censor the more vulgar parts of my post.
