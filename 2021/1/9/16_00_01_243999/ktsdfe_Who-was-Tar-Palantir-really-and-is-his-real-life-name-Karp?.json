His birth name was Inzilad\u00fbn (\"Flower of the West\" in Ad\u00fbnaic), the son of Ar-Gimilz\u00f4r. His father was a bitter opponent of the Valar and the Elves, and had banished the speaking of the Elven tongues in his realm. However, Inzilad\u00fbn's mother, Inzilb\u00eath, was secretly a member of the Faithful and taught her son to be an Elf-friend.\n\nWhen Inzilad\u00fbn took up the Sceptre it was a time of great darkness in N\u00famenor. Ever since the time of Tar-Atanamir, every King had spoken against the Valar and questioned the Ban they had put upon the N\u00famen\u00f3reans against sailing into the West. Inzilad\u00fbn sought to repent of these actions of his predecessors and took a Quenya name in the tradition of his ancestors: Tar-Palantir (\"The Far-sighted\"). \n\nOnce again the White Tree was properly tended, for Tar-Palantir's gift of foresight allowed him to ascertain that if the White Tree perished, then the line of Kings would also come to an end. The King also faithfully observed the ancient religious ceremonies of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans at due times.\n\nHowever, the Valar did not respond to Tar-Palantir's repentance because of the insolence of the Kings before him, and because most of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans were still hostile to the Lords of the West, and were led by Gimilkh\u00e2d, Tar-Palantir's own brother. Nor did Elven ships ever come from Tol Eress\u00eba to N\u00famenor again. Tar-Palantir became filled with sorrow over the continuing rebellion of his people, and began to spend more of his time at the tower of Tar-Minastir in the west of the isle, hoping at least to see Eress\u00eba on the horizon. But even the sight of it was withheld from him.\n\nTar-Palantir married late and had only one child, a daughter named M\u00edriel. M\u00edriel was named his official successor and would have followed his policies, but her rightful place as Queen of N\u00famenor was usurped by her husband, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n.\n\nSource-Tolkiengateway\n\n[ https://imgur.com/gallery/BcHBPUG)", "author_fullname": "t2_51kmcejx", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "\ud83d\ude80Who was Tar Palantir really and is his real life name Karp?\ud83d\ude80", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "DD"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "dd", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_ktsdfe", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "DD", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 18, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1610205602.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\u001b201208:5:2"}], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610233283.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "domain": "self.wallstreetbets", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Tar-Palantir was the twenty-fourth King of N\u00famenor.
