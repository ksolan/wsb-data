I usually stay away from puts as I'm a bull myself, but the uncertainty we're facing now requires some kind of hedge and I believe this is one of the better hedges out there. You guys do your own DD as always.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nTwitter doesn't actually turn up any profit. They have a negative cash flow and this is despite being public for over 7 years now. Their stock price has hovered between 14$ and 60$ over these past 7 years and its valuation right now has reached the point it was in 2015. 85% of twitter's money comes from ads. This is due to take a hit due to Apple's upcoming privacy changes which makes it harder to do targeted ads. At the same time, as the pandemic is beginning (eventually) to wind down, online commerce should go down a bit, maybe not to pre pandemic levels, but still, and that will further affect ad revenue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bubble insurance**\n\nWhether we are in a bubble or not doesn't matter. However, due to skyrocketing valuations of tech companies, you'd have to be extremely retarded not to at least hedge your positions. I'm sure most of you read the arguments for and against the bubble on other threads by now, so I'm not going to debate those here. What I'm going to assume is that there is a CHANCE that we're in a bubble and that it may burst at any time during the next 2 years. Could be tomorrow, could be in 2 years, could be in 5 years, could be fucking never idk. \n\nBut if you want to hedge, Twitter is one of the good companies you want to buy put leaps on. It's an online tech company that's already losing money in an environment that's supposed to make them TONS. if that doesn't reek of failure, idk what does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Political headwinds**\n\nI don't want to get political here, but we do have to at least mention the current situation. Twitter's decision to give a big fuck you to half of america is not how business works. If you're a conservative, forget about 'fairness'. If you're a liberal, forget about 'revenge'. If you want to make money, all you need to look into is just how monumentally they're fucked up from a business perspective. Twitter's user base has been hovering around 320 million mark since 2015 until today, while their userbase grew from 30 million to 300 million from 2010 to 2015. Clearly they've stagnated for a long while now. One of the reasons why social media has risen to be so influential over the past decade has been the freedom it allows users to express themselves. Big tech didn't pick sides in the beginning so their platforms attracted people from all over the place. \n\nNow, I don't know what portion of twitter's userbase is conservative, but it's surely not inconsequential. Booting off the platform this portion of the userbase will only make the company's value go down even more over the long term. There are also non conservatives who value freedom of speech who will also bleed out from the platform. Less users = less ads = less money = lower stock value.\n\nI haven't even mentioned the big tech antitrust and monopoly issues they're facing. And this is something the DEMOCRATS have suggested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion: All the signs point to twitter's demise. The company has very few positive things looking forward to, and most of these positive things are market wide, such as the new stimulus package. Any one sign written above in itself is not a good enough reason to short the stock.
