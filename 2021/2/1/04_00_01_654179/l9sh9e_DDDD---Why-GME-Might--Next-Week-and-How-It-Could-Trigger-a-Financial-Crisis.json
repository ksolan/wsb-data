Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.\n\n## What Exactly Happened at Robinhood This Week?\n\nThere has been plenty of speculation this week about what exactly went down and unverified (although reasonable) rumors on why Robinhood did this. I\u2019ll go over the top two theories before taking a deep dive into the \u201cofficial\u201d reason given by Robinhood.\n\n[**Pressure from the White House and Sequoia according to a Robinhood employee**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/l723kf/robinhood_insider_information/)\n\nThis statement has been [refuted by Sequoia](https://www.newsweek.com/sequoia-capitol-denies-pressuring-robinhood-stop-gamestop-trading-after-viral-reddit-post-1565269). I personally wouldn\u2019t believe the Sequoia part since I don\u2019t really know what they would gain from it - they\u2019re a Venture Capital firm, not a hedge fund, and would not be actively shorting stocks let alone be trading in stocks. It could be possible that the White House, or someone from the government did contact Robinhood - actually, I\u2019d be pretty shocked if no one called them at some point this week to ask wtf was going on.During this call, they may have been afraid that GameStop\u2019s short squeeze would have triggered a major financial crisis due to hedge funds collapsing and de-grossing, causing a mass selloff similar to what was seen in 2008 and in March 2020 - I\u2019ll talk more about this later. Basically, without Robinhood shutting down GME from being bought, it\u2019s actually very possible we would have seen the rest of the stock market collapse last week, and this was something the Biden administration was trying to make sure didn\u2019t happen in the first month in office.\n\n**Possible intervention from Citadel Securities**\n\nThis was a theory I personally believed in initially and would have been a very obvious area of scrutiny for many people. The most straightforward one being the fact that Citadel (the hedge fund) dumped a few billion into Melvin to bail it out a [few days ago](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340), who were the very well known shorts of GME. Citadel, the hedge fund, is owned by Citadel LLC, which happens to also run Citadel Securities - a market maker. If you don\u2019t know what this is, go grow a few brain wrinkles and read my [previous post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ygab/dddd_how_rwallstreetbets_created_a_financial/). Citadel Securities is effectively Robinhood\u2019s sugar daddy, directly being responsible for around [40% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/a-controversial-part-of-robinhoods-business-tripled-in-sales-thanks-to-high-frequency-trading-firms.html) in 2018 through their payment for order flow (i.e. selling your trades to Citadel, giving them the right of first refusal, and [potentially giving you a worse price](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321); this is how they get 0% commission trades btw).\n\nTheoretically, Citadel the hedge fund and Citadel the market maker is run independently and sister companies both owned by Citadel LLC, but anyone can see this being a potential conflict of interest. There\u2019s also a possibility that Citadel Securities losing billions of dollars being short so many GME calls (they write 99% of all options contracts) and probably not being perfectly Gamma and (especially) Vega hedged, so when those two greeks skyrocketed on GME they probably lost tons of money there. [According to WSB hero Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354947541125611526), he didn\u2019t invest in Robinhood when they came to him on multiple occasions because he thought the founders lacked integrity, implying he believes they might have been the type of people to sell out their users (granted, they already literally do this) and do this type of shit.\n\n**The Official Reason - Clearing House Limitations**\n\nLet\u2019s get to the [official reason put out by Robinhood](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility), which is that their clearing house, in this case the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, suddenly increased their collateral requirements on GME trades drastically. Apparently, **Robinhood is running out of cash**, so they weren\u2019t able to provide the cash collateral demanded by DTCC, and hence weren\u2019t able to trade through them. Let\u2019s dumb this down and talk about how brokerages work.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about what a clearing house is and how they work. Imagine Bob wants to sell Dylan a share of GME. There\u2019s a bunch of legal paperwork and logistics for actually transferring over the share, which can take a few days to finalize - this is called settlement. However, you don\u2019t want people being able to back out of this exchange during this process for obvious reasons, so that\u2019s where the clearing house comes in. Let\u2019s call this clearing house Mary. What Mary does is facilitate (clear) this exchange, and ensures both Bob and Dylan follow through with their trade by having them both immediately give Mary cash as collateral while the exchange settles. If one party was no longer able to meet their end of the exchange (eg. Dylan goes bankrupt), Mary acts as an insurer and is responsible for buying the share from Bob instead. If it turned out that Bob was lying about actually owning a share and can't transfer it over to Dylan in time (failure to deliver), Mary is responsible for finding that share for him instead.\n\nSince GME suddenly became very volatile, and the financial soundness of some parties and their ability to deliver their side of the trade have been suddenly called into question ([at least on the seller\u2019s side](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)), DTCC decided  (...or due to pressure from other sources?) to increase the collateral needed for buying GME to be more than 10x of the proportion of the market value of whatever it was before. Most brokerages reacted to this by disabling margin trading. For some reason, Robinhood went one step further and disabled trading for all accounts, possibly due to their relatively small cash reserves compared to places like Fidelity, and the relatively large number of users who use margin in the platform.\n\n## What\u2019s Robinhood Going To Do About GME?\n\nRobinhood\u2019s decision to stop purchases of GME basically got hate from literally everyone, to the point where it somehow united the country in a beautiful way. Here\u2019s a list of things that happened as a result of Robinhood\u2019s decision, for fun\n\n* [Ted Cruz retweeted AOC saying he completely agreed with her](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905)\n* [Protests at NYSE and Robinhood HQ](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/protesters-gather-at-robinhood-hq-nyse-in-response-to-restricted-stock-trades)\n* [Class action lawsuit](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html)\n* [Someone paid to have an airplane](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rlyx/this_guy_is_flying_a_banner_saying_suck_my_nuts/) fly around the Bay Area over Robinhood\u2019s office saying \u201cSuck my nuts Robinhood\u201d\n* [Angry Robinhood employees were given DoorDash credits for some reason?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7y5ka/robinhood_staff_unhappy_about_the_trading_hault/)\n* [Congressional investigation to Robinhood\u2019s decision](https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-job-posting-federal-affairs-congress-hearing-gamestop-reddit-2021-1)\n* [SEC investigation to Robinhood\u2019s decision](https://www.cnet.com/news/robinhood-troubles-sec-will-closely-review-actions-that-restricted-amc-gamestop-stock-trades/)\n\nClearly, this decision has single-handedly made Robinhood the most hated company in the world right now. It\u2019s especially bad given the optics - their mission is to literally \u201cdemocratize finance\u201d, with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions. This decision, whether intentional or not, has literally gone against everything about Robinhood\u2019s image and mission, and will end the company if not fixed soon. **All of this right as Robinhood is planning to launch their IPO**.\n\nThe people in charge of Robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume GME trading. So far we\u2019ve seen them raise $1B from investors and $500M through lines of credit overnight, although based on the fact that GME is still restricted, that doesn\u2019t seem to be enough. However, in my personal opinion, I think it's likely that Robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation, and once they do, **they will likely re-enable trading on GME. If that happens (which IMO will probably be some time next week), GME and all other high-SI stocks will absolutely** \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n## How GME Almost Caused (and Still Can Cause) a Stock Market Crash\n\nLet\u2019s go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the GME short squeeze - the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall. In fact, the stock market had the largest decline since October across all sectors on Wednesday when GME, AMC, and other high-SI stocks surged, with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after Robinhood suspending purchases; this was one of the biggest de-grossing of hedge funds in history. [Chamath wrote a great Twitter thread about this](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354883147523997697), so amazing that I\u2019ll just copy-paste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself.\n\n>*A children's book explanation of what's happening:*  \n>  \n>*1. If you are \"smart money\" you are allowed to take your $1 and leverage it up to $15+*  \n>  \n>*2. You can now buy $15 of stock AND if you promise to short companies, you can short $15 of stock as well*  \n>  \n>*3. In finance language, this means that you are $30 \"gross\" ($15 of longs + $15 of shorts) but $0 net (+$15 of longs -$15 of shorts). This makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero risk...but in reality, your $1 is exposed to $30 of risk.*  \n>  \n>*4. Now you go around and tell your friends about both your longs and your shorts and when you do it at a restaurant vs on Reddit, its called an \"ideas dinner\".*  \n>  \n>*5. You also publish your longs on a quarterly lag via an SEC rule.  You don't have to tell anyone about your shorts.*  \n>  \n>*6. Now the less cool people who weren't invited to the ideas dinners, start copying your longs based on your report.*  \n>  \n>*7. You realize that publicizing your shorts is also a good idea so instead of only selling stocks, you also BUY options (puts) which has to be reported.*  \n>  \n>*8. Now everyone can see both your longs and your shorts and if you have a hot hand, you can likely predict that the cool people from the dinner as well as the less cool people monitoring your filings will copy you.*  \n>  \n>*9. But then an outsider notices that the math is way off!*  \n>  \n>*10. Apparently, some of these shorts that you own represent more than 100% of the entire stock of the company. Huh?*  \n>  \n>*11. So he grabs his chicken fingers and champagne and buys, starts a massive short squeeze. 12. Other's see what's happening and they jump in.*  \n>  \n>*13. Now a massive short squeeze starts.  You have to cover your shorts ASAP. But the banks also notice that you don't have enough credit to cover the $30 they lent you and ask for more collateral. You now also have to sell your long positions.*  \n>  \n>*14. What happens next is that a cascade of short covering and long selling starts driving some stocks to the moon and others way down.  Which stocks went up? Basically the ones that were the most heavily shorted by you and your buddies in the first place.*\n\n[Hedge fund grossing \\/ de-grossing](https://preview.redd.it/c5we1d7e0se61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a11131168d69e5f3aea93c8fd087a1478500ddc)\n\nIn other words, as stocks like GME go up, the highly-leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. Most retail investors are limited to 2x leverage, but since hedge funds are \u201chedged\u201d by taking short and long positions, they can be up to 30x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price (i.e. Beta neutral), so they\u2019re \u201csafer\u201d. To get out of these short positions, they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable \u201cNet Exposure\u201d, triggering a sell-off in those stocks.\n\nA very similar thing actually happened in March (with risk-parity) causing hedge funds to similarly massively de-gross, and literally everything from GLD to even AMZN\u2019s stock price dropping as a result, even though theoretically COVID-19 would\u2019ve been good for both from a fundamental basis, as we saw later on. It\u2019s very likely that if Robinhood hadn\u2019t stopped purchases of GME, many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to de-gross causing a widespread stock market crash, potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the [decade-long liquidity (leverage)-fueled asset bubble we\u2019ve been experiencing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) In fact, this could still happen since it doesn\u2019t look like hedge funds have learned their lesson and **are still heavily short GME with Net Shares Shorts barely moving this week** [**according to S3 Partners**](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355225495835709441)**.** Furthermore, despite seeing the largest de-grossing of hedge funds since 2009, **gross exposure (aka leverage) of hedge funds still remains** [**close to record-high levels**](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-hedgefunds/goldman-sees-hedge-fund-exposures-close-to-records-ongoing-sell-off-risk-after-gamestop-swings-idUSL1N2K60GW).\n\n**TLDR**\n\nIn case your attention span was too short to read everything above,\n\n1. Robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume GME purchases, when this happen GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d\n2. Much of the stock market\u2019s value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so **if GME (and other common shorts) \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d the rest of the stock market might collapse around it, triggering a financial crisis**\n\n*Now, just to be clear, buying GME right now is joining a game of hot potato; the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner, but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder - and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short GME. That being said, with Short Interest barely moving this week, this day of reckoning doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019ll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above, it\u2019s probably more likely for GME to reach $1K next week than the probability that it\u2019ll fall below $100.*\n\nOr in other words, [I like these stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/).\n\nEDIT - Appearently S3 Partners just contradicted [their tweet on Friday](https://s3partners.com/Exclusive.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=10ds) and now indicate that shares short of GME have dipped below 30M shares.

Here\u2019s a list of things that happened as a result of Robinhood\u2019s decision, for fun</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905\">Ted Cruz retweeted AOC saying he completely agreed with her</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/protesters-gather-at-robinhood-hq-nyse-in-response-to-restricted-stock-trades\">Protests at NYSE and Robinhood HQ</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html\">Class action lawsuit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rlyx/this_guy_is_flying_a_banner_saying_suck_my_nuts/\">Someone paid to have an airplane</a> fly around the Bay Area over Robinhood\u2019s office saying \u201cSuck my nuts Robinhood\u201d</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7y5ka/robinhood_staff_unhappy_about_the_trading_hault/\">Angry Robinhood employees were given DoorDash credits for some reason?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-job-posting-federal-affairs-congress-hearing-gamestop-reddit-2021-1\">Congressional investigation to Robinhood\u2019s decision</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/robinhood-troubles-sec-will-closely-review-actions-that-restricted-amc-gamestop-stock-trades/\">SEC investigation to Robinhood\u2019s decision</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Clearly, this decision has single-handedly made Robinhood the most hated company in the world right now. It\u2019s especially bad given the optics - their mission is to literally \u201cdemocratize finance\u201d, with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions. This decision, whether intentional or not, has literally gone against everything about Robinhood\u2019s image and mission, and will end the company if not fixed soon. <strong>All of this right as Robinhood is planning to launch their IPO</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The people in charge of Robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume GME trading. So far we\u2019ve seen them raise $1B from investors and $500M through lines of credit overnight, although based on the fact that GME is still restricted, that doesn\u2019t seem to be enough. However, in my personal opinion, I think it&#39;s likely that Robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation, and once they do, <strong>they will likely re-enable trading on GME. If that happens (which IMO will probably be some time next week), GME and all other high-SI stocks will absolutely</strong> \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d**.**</p>\n\n<h2>How GME Almost Caused (and Still Can Cause) a Stock Market Crash</h2>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the GME short squeeze - the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall. In fact, the stock market had the largest decline since October across all sectors on Wednesday when GME, AMC, and other high-SI stocks surged, with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after Robinhood suspending purchases; this was one of the biggest de-grossing of hedge funds in history. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354883147523997697\">Chamath wrote a great Twitter thread about this</a>, so amazing that I\u2019ll just copy-paste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>A children&#39;s book explanation of what&#39;s happening:</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>1. If you are &quot;smart money&quot; you are allowed to take your $1 and leverage it up to $15+</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>2. You can now buy $15 of stock AND if you promise to short companies, you can short $15 of stock as well</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>3. In finance language, this means that you are $30 &quot;gross&quot; ($15 of longs + $15 of shorts) but $0 net (+$15 of longs -$15 of shorts). This makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero risk...but in reality, your $1 is exposed to $30 of risk.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>4. Now you go around and tell your friends about both your longs and your shorts and when you do it at a restaurant vs on Reddit, its called an &quot;ideas dinner&quot;.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>5. You also publish your longs on a quarterly lag via an SEC rule.  You don&#39;t have to tell anyone about your shorts.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>6. Now the less cool people who weren&#39;t invited to the ideas dinners, start copying your longs based on your report.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>7. You realize that publicizing your shorts is also a good idea so instead of only selling stocks, you also BUY options (puts) which has to be reported.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>8. Now everyone can see both your longs and your shorts and if you have a hot hand, you can likely predict that the cool people from the dinner as well as the less cool people monitoring your filings will copy you.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>9. But then an outsider notices that the math is way off!</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>10. Apparently, some of these shorts that you own represent more than 100% of the entire stock of the company. Huh?</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>11. So he grabs his chicken fingers and champagne and buys, starts a massive short squeeze. 12. Other&#39;s see what&#39;s happening and they jump in.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>13. Now a massive short squeeze starts.  You have to cover your shorts ASAP. But the banks also notice that you don&#39;t have enough credit to cover the $30 they lent you and ask for more collateral. You now also have to sell your long positions.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>14. What happens next is that a cascade of short covering and long selling starts driving some stocks to the moon and others way down.  Which stocks went up? Basically the ones that were the most heavily shorted by you and your buddies in the first place.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c5we1d7e0se61.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a11131168d69e5f3aea93c8fd087a1478500ddc\">Hedge fund grossing / de-grossing</a></p>\n\n<p>In other words, as stocks like GME go up, the highly-leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. Most retail investors are limited to 2x leverage, but since hedge funds are \u201chedged\u201d by taking short and long positions, they can be up to 30x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price (i.e. Beta neutral), so they\u2019re \u201csafer\u201d. To get out of these short positions, they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable \u201cNet Exposure\u201d, triggering a sell-off in those stocks.</p>\n\n<p>A very similar thing actually happened in March (with risk-parity) causing hedge funds to similarly massively de-gross, and literally everything from GLD to even AMZN\u2019s stock price dropping as a result, even though theoretically COVID-19 would\u2019ve been good for both from a fundamental basis, as we saw later on. It\u2019s very likely that if Robinhood hadn\u2019t stopped purchases of GME, many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to de-gross causing a widespread stock market crash, potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/\">decade-long liquidity (leverage)-fueled asset bubble we\u2019ve been experiencing.</a> In fact, this could still happen since it doesn\u2019t look like hedge funds have learned their lesson and <strong>are still heavily short GME with Net Shares Shorts barely moving this week</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355225495835709441\"><strong>according to S3 Partners</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Furthermore, despite seeing the largest de-grossing of hedge funds since 2009, <strong>gross exposure (aka leverage) of hedge funds still remains</strong> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-hedgefunds/goldman-sees-hedge-fund-exposures-close-to-records-ongoing-sell-off-risk-after-gamestop-swings-idUSL1N2K60GW\"><strong>close to record-high levels</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong></p>\n\n<p>In case your attention span was too short to read everything above,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume GME purchases, when this happen GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d</li>\n<li>Much of the stock market\u2019s value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so <strong>if GME (and other common shorts) \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d the rest of the stock market might collapse around it, triggering a financial crisis</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>Now, just to be clear, buying GME right now is joining a game of hot potato; the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner, but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder - and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short GME. That being said, with Short Interest barely moving this week, this day of reckoning doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019ll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above, it\u2019s probably more likely for GME to reach $1K next week than the probability that it\u2019ll fall below $100.</em></p>\n\n<p>Or in other words, <a href=\"https://www.highshortinterest.com/\">I like these stocks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT - Appearently S3 Partners just contradicted <a href=\"https://s3partners.com/Exclusive.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=announcement&amp;utm_campaign=10ds\">their tweet on Friday</a> and now indicate that shares short of GME have dipped below 30M shares. Still highly shorted compared to most other stocks, fwiw.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false,
